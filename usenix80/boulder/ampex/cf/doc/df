.th "DISK FREE" VIII 6/79
.sh NAME
df - disk free
.sh SYNOPSIS
df [filesystem] [-c] [-ca] [-cav]
.sh DESCRIPTION
	...	(same as existing description)
	If a -c option is specified, the filesystem must also be specified.
The amount of free storage left on the associated contiguous file system
is examined.  With -c, only the size(in chunks) of the largest available
contiguous region is printed.  With -ca, the sizes of all chunks are printed.
With -cav, the sizes of all chunks are printed "verbosely", i.e. first
chunk number, last chunk number, and size.  In the -ca and -cav cases, an
inorder b-tree traversal should result in the available chunks being printed
out in the order of their physical address on disk.
