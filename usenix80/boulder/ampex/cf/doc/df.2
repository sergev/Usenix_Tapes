DISK FREE(VIII)               6/79                DISK FREE(VIII)



NAME
     df - disk free

SYNOPSIS
     df [filesystem] [-c] [-ca] [-cav]

DESCRIPTION
             ...     (same as existing description)         If  a
     -c  option  is specified, the filesystem must also be speci-
     fied.  The amount of free storage  left  on  the  associated
     contiguous  file  system  is  examined.   With  -c, only the
     size(in chunks) of the largest available  contiguous  region
     is  printed.  With -ca, the sizes of all chunks are printed.
     With -cav, the sizes of all chunks are printed  "verbosely",
     i.e.  first  chunk  number, last chunk number, and size.  In
     the -ca and -cav cases, an inorder b-tree  traversal  should
     result in the available chunks being printed out in the ord-
     er of their physical address on disk.
