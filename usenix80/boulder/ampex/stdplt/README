Sources for stdplt library are all here; they assume version 7.
If you have v6 phototypesetter package, only minor changes should
be required, if any.
If you have original v6 C compiler, get v7 - there are a fair number
of v7 C constructs in the sources.
stdplt.h goes in /usr/include.
libP.a goes in /usr/lib.
makelib will remove libP.a and reconstruct it, but I haven't tried it
out recently.
tst directory has some misc. test programs.

If you have serious troubles, call me at (415) 367-4618 days.
