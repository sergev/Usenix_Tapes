The "doc" directory contains manual pages for the enclosed programs.
The original Bell manual structure has been replaced by by a simpler
one that is approximated on this tape.  The structure is described
below:

form -- old sections 4 and 5.  This is special files and file formats.
guide -- these are the equivalent of the Bell memos, but in a uniform
	format.  Actual Bell documents are not on this tape, only
	papers originated at the AFDSC.
progs -- old sections 1, 6, and 8.  Commands.
subs -- old sections 2, 3, and 7.  System calls and subroutines.
