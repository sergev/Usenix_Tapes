This directory contains the source code for programs, kernels, and
software distribution standalone programs used by the AFDSC.

distrib -- standalone programs used to create software distribution
	tapes.  Based on Bell's programs, but made more modular and
	enhanced with utilities like help or table of contents.  Made
	to be put on a 'tp' tape.
kernel -- our latest version of the kernel, with multiple DH/DM drivers,
	corrected RK06/7 and RP04/5/6 drivers, alternate block code.
macros -- an extensive library of macros for AF publications, administrative
	support, briefing slides, and forms definitions.
progs -- the source code for various programs enhanced or developed at
	AFDSC.
subs -- some old friends and systems calls, but new versions or some, and
	some original ones (see "getdate") for your subroutine library.
	The accompanying programs might need these, too.
