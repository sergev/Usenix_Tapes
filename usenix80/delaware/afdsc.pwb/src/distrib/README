This directory contains programs for AFDSC distribution tapes.
An AFDSC distribution tape is a standard 'tp' format tape.
Contents of the tape include 1) a tape boot block; 2) standalone
boot, copy, and help programs; and 3) root file system image.

When in standalone mode, files may be executed or copied from the tape
by calling the cppropriate copy or help programs.  The tapes and
programs support TU-10, -16, and -45 tape drives, and RK05/6/7
and RP04/5/6 disk drives and any combination thereof.  The programs are
modular, so new disks and tapes are easily added.  The lack of
sophistication in the drivers make new ones easy to implement.

When under UNIX, the tape may be treated as any other 'tp' tape,
via the 'tp' command.  This allows for easy extraction, listing, or
replacement of files on the tape.
