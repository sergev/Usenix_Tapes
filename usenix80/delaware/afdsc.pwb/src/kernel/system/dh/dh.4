.th DH IV 5/27/74
.sh NAME
dh \*- DH-11 communications multiplexer
.sh DESCRIPTION
Each line attached to the DH-11 communications multiplexer
behaves as described in tty (IV).
In addition, these lines have a "stall" feature;
while in "cooked" mode, typing
control-s suspends output(and if necessary, program execution) until
another character is typed. If the next character is a control-q,
it is not echoed, nor is it passed to standard input.  Any other
character is.
Input and output for each line may independently
be set to run at any of 16 speeds;
see stty (II)
for the encoding.
