This directory contains macros written at AFDSC.  They are somewhat
specific to AF formats, except for the briefing slide and forms macros.

There are four groups of "lead" macro packages that call the
other ones as needed.  Thus, to do a business letter, you would
enter the command line "nroff -m p lttrfile" and tmac.p would
call any page or para macro files it needed without your intervention.

Note that to use the paragraphing macros (.pp) without invoking
a specific document type (such as letter), you must start your source
file with ".se".  This sets up page traps and other environmental
considerations.

tmac.p -- administrative support macros (memos, letters, paragraphs, signature
	blocks, attachment lists, footnotes, etc).
tmac.pub -- AF publications macros (large manuals, table of contents, two
	column, footnotes, etc).
tmac.bf -- briefing slide macros (overview and body slides with various
	levels and bullet markers).
tmac.FORMS -- forms definition macros (roll your own forms).
