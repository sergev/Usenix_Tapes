This directory is the annotated bibliography of the Tilbrook distribution tape.
It is offered as an example of a TIPs data base,
as an aid to the installer, and as a potential standard for
distributions (modest aren't I).

Completion of the bibliography prior to the conference
proved to be too difficult, thus many of the required records are not done.

A completed data base will be available by March 1980,
and can be obtained, if you really want it from D.M. Tilbrook.
