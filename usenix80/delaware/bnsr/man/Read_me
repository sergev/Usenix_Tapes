This is the UPM directory for entries for most of the software on
the Tilbrook/Pike distribution.

DIRECTORIES:

man3	UPM entries for non-standard subroutines required for programs
man5	UPM entries for special files.

FILES:

PATHNAME repl change lines:

The Read_me's in this tree do not contain path name change lines
because the documents tend to have a lot of references to path names
in inconsistant forms, and correcting them is not required to run
the software.
