The files in this directory are the only ones
other than the standard libc.a files
that were required to compile the source files in this distribution.
Printf.s is extended to add: zero filling (when field width
	begins with `0'), and sprintf.
Fprintf.s invokes printf with output directed to the fid passed
	as the 1st argument to fprintf.
Derror is a perror with an arbitary message, and optional exit.
Strequal takes two string arguments and returns 1 iff they are equal.
Logdir returns string pointer to login directory.

Files that use logdir have a -lPW on the com line, since /lib/libPW.a
has a logdir suitable for PWB.

DIRECTORIES:

FILES:

derror.c -- derror source
fprintf.s -- fprintf source
logdir.c -- return char pointer to login directory pointer
printf.s -- printf source
strequal.c -- strequal source
