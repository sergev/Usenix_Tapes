This directory contains the Qed buffers required by the
TIPS Data Base editor (dbed).  See Dbed (T).
Also provided is a qed buffer (mkprof.q) that takes an
input listing of tags and creates a profile.q.

WARNING: Mkprof is a quick and dirty.
To use create a listing of the records and their fields
as shown in `map.x' in a buffer (not `{').
Load mkprof.q into buffer `b'.
Change to the buffer holding the map and do \bb.
It will write out a profile.c file which can be makeprof'd.
Mkprof.q makes little attempt to catch any errors other than
those it needs to check its pattern matching.
User be wary.
