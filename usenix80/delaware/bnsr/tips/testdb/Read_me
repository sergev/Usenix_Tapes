/*% cat %
This directory contains a data dictionary for the UNIX/PWB kernel.
The entries are ordered alphabetically within the data files.
The entries in this data base are the
procedures in os/*.c plus those files in io/*.c
that contain procedures called from files other than the defining one.

NOTE: to facilitate the usages generation, every proc entry line
in os/*.c and io/*.c should contain "/*ENTRY xxx */".
Also, usages requires a lot of path name patches, so no pathnames provided.

The files [ef]profile are for comparison with the .[ef]profile files
generated by makeprof.
