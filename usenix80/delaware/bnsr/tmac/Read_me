This directory contains the set of tools and macros
for generating reports.
The interesting thing about the contained macros is
the attempt to make the input documents as style independent as possible.
The macros are set up to be driven by parameters and styles
established by a ``parms'' file.
The input documents themselves are largely restricted to
section macros (s[1-9]), point macros (p[1-9]),
paragraph macros (pg, Pg, Bu, bu, hd, HD),
table macros (t[1-9]), and figure spaces.
Users at BNSR have been encouraged to avoid anything outside of this set.
