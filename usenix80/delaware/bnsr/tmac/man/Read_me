This directory contains the UPM entries for the macro sets.
The tmac.what.9 file is actually a listing of the macro sets.
This file is used by Smac(I) for documentation purposes.

NOTE: All macros are described on lines that look like:
.mc "FI [file reference]" "set file reference"

The program smac(I) looks for such lines and displays them.
