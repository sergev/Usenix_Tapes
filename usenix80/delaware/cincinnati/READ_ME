This is the distribution from the University of Cincinnati,
Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering. It
consists of:

other	dtp-- a program to read and write DOS-11 formatted
	tapes. (As written by RSTS/E PIP or RSX FLX.)

nec	a first attempt at nroff driving tables for the NEC
	Spinwriter

ramtek	a library and some programs for the RAMTEK RM9200
	raster graphics display. These are preliminary;
	they will be completely rewritten and extended
	this summer, but I had so much trouble getting 
	these, I thought that there might be at least one
	other person out there who had perused back issues
	of ;login: late at night for such things to no avail.


I would appreciate hearing from anyone who finds bugs or makes
extensions to any of these programs; also, I would
like to hear from anyone who has found something intelligent
to do with RK05F (fixed media) disk drives!


	Good luck,
