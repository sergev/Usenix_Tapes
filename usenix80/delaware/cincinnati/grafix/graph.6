NAME
     graph - draw a graph

SYNOPSIS
     _g_r_a_p_h [ option ] ... | plotter

DESCRIPTION
     _G_r_a_p_h with no options takes pairs of numbers from the  stan-
     dard input as abscissas and ordinates of a graph.  The graph
     is written on the standard output to be piped to the plotter
     program for a particular device; see _p_l_o_t (VI).

     If the coordinates of a point are followed by  a  nonnumeric
     string,  that  string is printed as a label beginning at the
     point.  Labels may be surrounded with quotes "...", in which
     case  they  may contain blanks or begin with numeric charac-
     ters; labels never contain newlines.

     The following options are recognized, each as a separate ar-
     gument.

     -a   Supply abscissas automatically (they are  missing  from
          the  input);  spacing is given by the next argument, or
          is assumed to be 1 if next argument is not a number.  A
          second  optional argument is the starting point for the
          automatic abscissa.

     -c   Character string given by next argument is default  la-
          bel for each point.

     -d   Omit connections between points. (Disconnect.)

     -g_n  Grid style:
          _n=0, no grid
          _n=1, axes only
          _n=2, complete grid (default).

     -l   Next argument is label for graph.

     -s   Save screen, don't erase before plotting.

     -x   Next 1 (or 2) arguments are lower (and upper) _x limits.
          Third  argument, if present, is grid spacing on _x axis.
          Normally these quantities are determined automatically.

     -y   Similarly for _y.

     -h   Next argument is fraction of space for height

     -w   Similarly for width.

     -r   Next argument is fraction of space to move right before
          plotting.

     -u   Similarly to move up before plotting.

     Points are connected by straight line segments in the  order
     they  appear  in  input.  If a specified lower limit exceeds
     the upper limit, or if the automatic increment is  negative,
     the graph is plotted upside down.  Automatic abscissas begin
     with the lower _x limit, or with 0 if no limit is  specified.
     Labels  are  placed  so that the center of an initial letter
     such as + will fall approximately on the plotting point.

BUGS
     _G_r_a_p_h stores all points internally even when limits are  ex-
     plicit, so utterly enormous graphs can fail unnecessarily.
