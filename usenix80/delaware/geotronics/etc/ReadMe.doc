/Geotronics/etc		system administration shell command files

These are all used by the system manager.  In particular, "startup" is
used to turn on remote terminals, and "shutdown" performs an orderly
turnoff of timesharing.  The "rc" startup file invokes "sucron" as
process # 7; this is just "cron" modified to have user ID 0 (root).

You can schedule some of the clean-up and accounting commands in
the crontab used by "sucron" (we used "sucrontab").  Our schedule table
is supplied here as a guide.

Our "System Manager Notes" are contained in file "SysMgr".  We keep this
around for emergency use when the gurus are at Usenix conferences.

All these files belong in the /etc directory.
