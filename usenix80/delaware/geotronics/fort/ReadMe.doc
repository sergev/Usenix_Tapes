/Geotronics/fort	patches for Fortran compiler.

These primarily fix bugs involving 1-byte data type support.  These
are necessary to support character arrays, etc.  A patch is included
to permit use of "D" and "E" as exponent indicators in formatted input.

Each subdirectory contains *.e ed scripts for the corresponding
/usr/source/fort subdirectory files.
