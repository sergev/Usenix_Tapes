				GAMES POLICY


Game playing is not permitted on the system between the hours
8-12 and 13-17 Mon-Fri.

To play a game at other times, log in under the game name:
	bj	chess	cubic	moo	quiz	ttt	wump
The password is (temporarily) "######".

"quiz" logs you into a scratch directory, from which the various quiz
commands can be invoked.  The other games run directly; Ctrl/D logs out.
