			HELP FOR "Ratfor"


Our Ratfor language processor is considerably more modern than that
presented in Unix V6 manuals.  The full language described in "Software
Tools" by Kernighan & Plauger is supported, with a few extensions.

There are enough differences from the older dialect to cause you grief
if you do not read the Language Reference Manual, /hlp/ratfor.doc .
