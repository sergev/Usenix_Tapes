/Geotronics/rat		patches for Ratfor preprocessor

The *.e ed scripts herein implement the Ratfor language in conformance
with "Software Tools" by Kernighan & Plauger (Addison-Wesley, 1976).

A system-independent Language Reference Manual is also included as
../hlp/ratfor.doc.  There are several changes from the Unix V6 version.

The SysDef.r file should be put into directory /usr/include for
inclusion into user programs via the "include" statement.  If you plan
to use Unix V6 Fortran, you should apply the fixes in ../fort.
../s2 also contains an edit script for the "rc" program.
