/Geotronics/s6		some utility programs

order	produces a list of library routines sorted in topological order,
	for constructing an "ar" build command file to ensure that a
	library need be searched only once to satisfy all references.
	(This problem would be better addressed by improving "ld".)

pg	paginates output to terminal, to permit reading files without a
	scrolling-off-screen problem.

qume	provides ETX/ACK synchronization for printing at high speed on
	terminals using this protocol.  (The tty handler mods support
	the DC3/DC1 "stall" protocol for other terminals.)

retab	general entabbing/detabbing utility.  Especially useful after
	editors which turn tabs into spaces.

rtblap	transfers specified blocks to Unix file.  Used to pick up RT-11
	files whose locations and sizes are known from DIR/BLOCK .
