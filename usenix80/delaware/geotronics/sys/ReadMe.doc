/Geotronics/sys		operating system modifications

The *.e files in this directory and its subdirectories are ed scripts
for the corresponding /usr/sys files.  These are the minimum changes
we felt we could get by with:

1)  Support for MOS parity memory (M7850-style controllers).  This is
    compatible with systems that have non-parity memory installed.
2)  DC3/DC1 "stall" support for terminals (needed especially for VT100).
3)  Full support for the DZ11 async line multiplexer, including dialup.
    The "getty" and "stty" mods in ../s1 and ../s2 are also required.
    Considerable effort has been made to support all DZ configurations.
4)  Support for FP11 floating-point in m40.s (11/34).
    There is a related patch for "cdb" in ../s1 also.
5)  Support for Emulex SC11/A2 controller with 80Mb disk.
    We use 57000-block "rpa" & "rpb", with "rpc" swap and "rpd" scratch.
    This patch is compatible with standard RP11 controllers too.
6)  Simplify and improve line printer driver.
7)  Various minor bug fixes (not a complete set, by any means).

"mkunix" contains the commands we run to rebuild our system.
