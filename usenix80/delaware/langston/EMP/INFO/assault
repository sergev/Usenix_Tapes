.TH Command : ASSAULT
.s1
The assault command allows your marines to "hit the beaches".
To run this command type:
.EX assault 32,54
if sector 32,54 is to be assaulted.
The program will ask which ship is doing the assaulting and
how many brave troops to disembark...
These suckers face the problem of reaching the beach, i.e. they
are less effective than any land troops they encounter.
Both capitals and forts fight twice as hard as other sectors
against sea assaults.
