.TH Command : CENSUS

The census command allows you to see specific information on
some or all of the sectors you occupy.  The general form of the command
is:
.EX census (sects)
where (sects) is the area on which you wish information (see "info syntax").

A typical usage might be:
.EX census -3:3,-3:3
which would list data for the area extending three sectors
out from the capital in each direction; or
.EX census 0:9,0:9 ?des=m
which would list data for mines to the south-east of the capital.

A census lists each of your sectors in that area followed by:
