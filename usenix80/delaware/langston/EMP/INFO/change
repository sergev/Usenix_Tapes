.TH "Command : CHANGE COUNTRY NAME, REPRESENTATIVE NAME or USER"
.s1
This simple command enables you
to rename your country or your representative
or to change the computer account ("user")
associated with your country.

You will first be asked for your current (not new!)
representative's name (just to make sure you are
legit).
.NF +3
.EX change country name
I.D. check: Your name? (here you type 'goofball' or whatever)
New name -- Mountainia
.FI
This will change the name of your country to "Mountainia".
Similarly, to change your representative's name:
.NF +3
.EX change representative
I.D. check: Your name? (goofball again)
New name -- quasimodo
.FI
Your representative's name will now be "quasimodo",
(note that although the name you typed for "I.D. check"
didn't print out, the new name you
typed did print out, in case of a typing error.
As a consequence,
you won't want to do this while your arch-enemy is watching.)

.NF +3
.EX change user
I.D. check: Your name?  (quasimodo)
Currently only kissinger can use this country.
You may reset it to only you (kissinger) or to anyone.
Which? (answer "me" or "any")  any
.FI
This will allow anyone who knows your representative's name to log
in in to your country.
This would be handy if several people were running one
country as a "team" (polite word for "committee").
Similarly, to reestablish the check on user identity:
.NF +3
.EX change user
I.D. check: Your name? (quasimodo)
Currently anyone can use this country.
You may reset it to only you (kissinger) or to anyone.
Which? (answer "me" or "any")  me
.FI
This will disallow anyone but you to log in to mountainia.
The switch to "any" and then back to "me" could also be used
to transfer control of a country from one user to another.
