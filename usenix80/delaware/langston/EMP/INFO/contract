.TH Command : CONTRACT
.s1
The contract command allows you to sell the output of a
particular industry directly to the outside world
(via The Deity, country 0).
For instance, to sell the production units generated in a
shell industry located at -3,3 type:
.EX contract -3,3
and the program will reply with something like:
.NF +3
The Deity offers $3.15 per unit of production in -3,3  do you accept?
.FI
At which point you can take it or leave it (answer "yes" or "no").
If you already have a contract for the given sector a "yes" answer
will reset the sale price to the current offer
(the prices offered vary slightly with time)
and a "no" answer will
end the contract.
.s3
The presence of a contracted sale in a sector is indicated by a dollar sign,
("$") in the census.
