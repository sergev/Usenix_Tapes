The country roster command allows you to determine the number,
names and various other information about countries currently in the game.
The general form is:

The country roster will also contain
the time that each country last logged out of the game (or the terminal
they are on if currently
logged in), the number of Bureaucratic Time Units (B.T.U.s) remaining
and each nation's status.
