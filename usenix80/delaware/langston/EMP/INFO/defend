.TH Command : DEFEND
.s1
The defend command allows forts to defend other sectors from attack.
The defending fort will fire upon any attacking forces. To run type:
.EX defend (sects)
The program will ask from which fort this area is to be defended,
(note that forts can only protect as far as they can fire).
The census report indicates sectors that are being defended with
a percent sign ("%").

If you wish to find out which fort(s) are defending a particular area
use the following form of the defend command:
.EX defend (sects) %
The presence of the percent sign ("%") causes the program to run an
I.D. check on you and then display
the protecting fort location for each sector in the area given.
