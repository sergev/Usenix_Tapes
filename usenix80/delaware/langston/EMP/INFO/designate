.TH Command : DESIGNATE
.s1
In Empire all sectors (land) have a "designation".  The "designation"
represents the principal industry or activity taking place in that
area.  When a sector is designated a harbor, for example,  the civilians
in the sector start building shipyards and docks (with a little help from
any military present).  At first the sector's efficiency will drop
to 0%, indicating that no harbor facilities are available.  As work
progresses the efficiency will climb toward a maximum of 100%.
.s1
The general form of the designate command is:
.EX designate (sects)
The program will ask for each sector specified
what you want the new sector designation to be.
However, if you wish to designate one or several
sectors to be one particular thing and don't want to
be asked on them you can type:
.EX designate (sects) designation
For example:
.EX designate -3:3,-3:3 ?des=- +
This will designate all wildernesses (that you own) within
three sectors of your capitol to be roads.
.s1
One special note on designating capitals. You can have more
than one sector designated as a capital, however the
most recently designated one is your 'real' capital.
It is this capital that is used for the computation of
your B.T.U.'s and for that reason it is also the one
your enemy will try to capture during a war.
