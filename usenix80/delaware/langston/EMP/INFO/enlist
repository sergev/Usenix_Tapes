.TH Command : ENLIST
.s1
The enlist command invokes a draft in the sectors given.
To run this command type:
.EX enlist (sects)
The command will ask you how many troops you wish to call up.
It will then list each sector where troops answer the call and the 
number who showed up. Note that only 50% of the civilians in a sector can
be called upon at any one time and that no one in an urban area
is willing to be drafted.  In addition the military become
unix irreversibly (no population growth) and lazy workers.
