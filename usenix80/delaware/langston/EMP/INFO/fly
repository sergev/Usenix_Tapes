.TH Command : FLY
.s1
The "fly" command is the "move" or "navigate" of the air.
It represents a complete mission for one or several planes
taking off from one place (and perhaps ending up in one place).
The general form of the command is:
.EX fly (sect)
or
.EX fly (ship)
Although planes can land on any kind of sector,
(with varying degrees of success),
they can only take off from airfields and aircraft carriers;
thus (sect) must be the x,y of an airfield and (ship) must be
the ship number of an aircraft carrier.
.s1
The program requests information as to number of planes and bombs
on the mission and tells you how many of each is
available to you, (note that each plane requires 2 military as crew).
And then you're in the air.
.s1
Vital statistics such as fuel, (mobility), are displayed with the prompt:
.s1
.ti 3
<7.5:6:2:-6,4>
.s3
which indicates 7.5 fuel units, 6 planes, 2 bombs (each), flying
over sector -6,4.
The number of fuel units loaded in each plane is the same and is
calculated as:
.s1
.nf
.in +5
fuel_available = sector_mobility * 4;
fuel_used = min(fuel_available, 32)     (fuel tank size is 32)
fuel-units = technology_factor * fuel_used
.in -5
.fi
.s1
If your planes are carrying no bombs, and the weather is not stormy,
they will be able to travel 1 sector, (orthogonally), per fuel unit.
If they are carrying bombs
the per sector fuel cost rises by 1 for each bomb rack required,
(each bomb rack can hold up to three bombs),
and by .2 for each bomb, (although this is often only a one-way cost).
All the commands take the same amount of fuel except
the diagonal motions which take 1.414 times as much.

The safest place to land is on a 100% efficient carrier
or 100% efficient airfield.
If the airfield is less than 60% built your chances
of a safe landing are proportionately less than 100%.
Other sectors are also possible landing sites as in this table:
.sp
.NF
.ti 18
sector efficiency
designation|     0%    50%   100%
-----------|    ---    ---   ----
airfield         0%    83%   100%
road            40%    57%    73%
other           50%    30%    10%

When flying over land owned by another country great care should be
taken to avoid flying over sectors that automatically shoot at you
(unless they are checkpointed and you know the code).  Fortresses,
capitals and airfields all fire on "foreign" aircraft (assuming they
have the guns & shells).  When this happens to you the flak will appear
on your terminal along with the dying groans of your pilots, (kinda
makes it hard to sleep at night).
.s1
Three final words of caution:
.br
1)  Always keep an eye on the fuel gauge
.br
2)  Be careful where you land.
.br
3)  Don't do anything that you shouldn't.
