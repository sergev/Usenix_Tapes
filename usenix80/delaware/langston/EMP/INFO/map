.TH Command : MAP
.s1
A map gives you a graphic image of all or part of your country.
Your own sectors show up as a designation mnemonic
(see "sector-types") while sectors held by other countries
appear as question marks ("?").
Mountains and seas appear as '^^' and '..' (respectively) but,
if the map is being sent to a file or the printer,
the mountains will appear as '##' for greater printer legibility.
.s1
The form of the map command is:
.EX map (sects)
where (sects) is the area for which you wish a map.
.s1
Examples:
.EX map -8:8,-5:3

in the area specified.
