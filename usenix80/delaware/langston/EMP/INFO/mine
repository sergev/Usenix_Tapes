.TH Command : MINE
.s1
The mine command drops mines in the sea and is only functional from destroyers.
Each mine introduces a 5% chance that a passing ship will be hit.
The damage is severe but dependent upon the size of the ship.
.s3
To drop mines type:
.EX mine (ship)
Where (ship) is the number of one of your destroyers.

You will be asked how many mines you wish to drop and that number
of shells (assuming you got 'em) will be dropped in the sector
that (ship) occupies, magically becoming mines as they hit the water.

Mines can only be removed safely by a minesweeper.
(Other ships can remove them by hitting them, but...)

For various reasons harbors and bridge spans can not be mined.

Note that the sector is checked for possible mine hits only when a ship
moves into it; thus, a destroyer may safely drop mines in a sector and
then move out.
On the other hand, the mines know no allegiance, so moving back into
a mined sector is foolish at best.
