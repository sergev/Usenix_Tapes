.TH Command : NAVIGATE
.s1
The navigate command is the move command applied to the sea.
You can control one ship or a fleet. To run type:
.EX navigate (ship/fleet)
where (ship/fleet) is the ship number or the fleet letter.
.s3
If you are moving a fleet and the flagship stops, the fleet stops.
(The lowest numbered ship is considered the flagship.)
.s1
The program will prompt with the mobility of the flagship,
the minimum mobility value for the fleet and the current sector
coordinates in the form:
.s1
.ti 3
<97.0:23.5: -6,4>
.s3
which means the flagship has 97 mobility units,
some other ship in the fleet has 23.5 mobility units and
the flagship is in sector -6,4.
You may indicate the direction you would like the fleet to move
by typing a string of letters consisting of any combination of the
following:
.NF
u  for up
d  for down                \\\\l    u     /r
r  for right
l  for left                     \\\\|/
\\\\l for up-left             l  --   --  r
/r for up-right                 /|\\\\
/l for down-left
\\\\r for down-right          /l    d     \\\\r
v  for view
e  for end of movement
.FI
.s1
Typical orthogonal, (u, d, l or r), moving costs in good weather
are:
.NF +3
ship       25% tech factor   50% tech factor   100% tech factor
type         cost/sector       cost/sector       cost/sector
------          ----              ----              ----
pt boat          7.68              6.4              4.8
submarine       15.36             12.8              9.6
battleship      15.36             12.8              9.6
destroyer       10.96              9.13             6.85
freighter       19.2              16.0              12.0
minesweep       19.2              16.0              12.0
tender          12.8              10.67             8.0
carrier         15.36             12.8              9.6

.s1
In bad weather movement costs more
(on the order of 10%); in very bad weather ships may be damaged by
moving them.
.s1
Moving a ship through a sector that has been mined by a destroyer
introduces a 5% chance per mine (cumulative) that you will be damaged
by "detecting" one of the little cuties.  Minesweeps can remove up
to five mines per pass through a sector (indicated by the message
"Sweep...").
