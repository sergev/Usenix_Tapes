.TH Concept : PRAYERS
.s1
There is one country in the game that has no material possessions yet
owns everything... That country is country #0 (often called "The Deity").
The power of this ethereal country is unbounded -- it
can do anything from creating a civilian (as was the case with the
first civilian),
to literally moving mountains.
.s1
Despite this great power The Deity is the champion of the meek
and it is to country #0 that
the downtrodden turn when in need of aid. The most common form of prayer
is the telegram; if you should be in need of aid type:
.EX telegram 0
.in 14
When the program asks your message for The Deity state it simply, e.g.
.NF 3
Enter message for The Deity; end with ^D
<122> Fumia took my capital and then deleted my account!
<71> HELP!!
<64> ^D
.FI
If this doesn't get helpful results then you should send a
second prayer with more specific details. e.g.
.NF 3
<122> I'll donate a bar of gold (to charity)
<83> for 20% more efficiency in my capital.
<43> okay?
<38> ^D
.FI

This last message is sure to move the compassionate Deity to
provide help.

Note that The Deity wouldn't consider providing
instruments of destruction like guns & shells (unless, of course, the church
had a particularly great need for a new set of gold candlesticks or
the like).
