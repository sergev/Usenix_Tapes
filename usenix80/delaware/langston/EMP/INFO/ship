.TH Command : SHIP REPORT
.s1
The ship report command is a census of your ships and lists all the
info available in readable format.

To run type:
.EX ship <ship/fleet/sects>	(arguments in <> are optional)
The <ship/fleet/sects> is in case you only wish to look at one ship
or one fleet or all ships within a given area.
If no argument is given your entire navy will be listed.
The report format is:

.NF +3
  #   type       x,y   f  eff c/m sh gun pln ore gold  mu

designation letter (set by "create" command), eff is the ship's
efficiency, c/m is the number of crew (civilians on a freighter,
military otherwise), sh is shells, guns is guns, pln is planes,
