.TH Command : TORPEDO
.s1
The torpedo command is used to shoot up ships.
The general form is:
.EX torpedo (ship)
Where (ship) is the victim ship number.
.s1
The program will then ask for your sub number and check that it meets the
following criteria:
.NF +5
1) It must be a submarine
2) It must have at least 1 gun (torpedo tube)
3) It must have at least 3 shells (3 shells = 1 torpedo)
4) It must be at least 60% efficient
.FI
Meeting all these criteria, your torp will be launched toward the
victim ship...  A countdown of seconds until the expected detonation
will commence.  Since the range of torpedos is a maximum of 1.99999 or so,
anything a distance of 2 or more from you will be out of range and you will
be told so, (after your torp is in the water).
If you are in range,
your chance of making a hit will be dependent on your distance from the
target: 90% if you're in the same sector, 22% if you're orthogonally adjacent
and 13% if you're diagonally adjacent.
A hit which will be reported to you
as "BOOM!" followed by a report of the damage done to the victim ship.
The damage done is dependent on the size of the victim ship.
A torpedo does between 63% and 100% damage to a pt boat and
between 28% and 56% damage to a battleship or aircraft carrier.

In order to simulate the "real-time" situation your mobility will go
negative (forcing you to stick around).  Your first torp will make your
mobility go to -10; the second will make it -20; etc.  If your torpedo
scores a hit your victim will be informed of the fact and will be told
the number of the sub, but not the country (so you can deny it).

The victim's only automatic protection against sub attacks is that
any destroyer of his (hers) that is in the same sector as you
and that has shells will drop them on you as depth charges.  Each
depth charge does 30% to 40% damage to your sub.
