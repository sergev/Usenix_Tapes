.TH Command : TRADE REPORT
.s1
The trade report lists all items for sale in exchange sectors
and/or all ships that are being sold and allows you to buy these items.
The three forms of the trade command are:
.EX trade
.EX trade land
and
.EX trade naval
The "land" and "naval" forms deal only in exchange items and ships,
respectively.  The first form deals with both.
Because the first and second forms require a scan of the entire world
they take a few moments to run.
Typical output looks like:
.NF +3
.EX trade
