.TH Command : VOTE
.s1
The vote command allows you decide on a written treaty. You may
vote yes, no , or abstain.  Yes - of course you accept.  No - i guess
you turn it down.  Abstain - you haven't got the guts to say no but
are too ambitious to say yes (i.e. You can come back to vote again another day).
To run type:
.EX vote (treaty)
where (treaty) is the treaty number.
