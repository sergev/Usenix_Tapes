.TH "GENERAL INFORMATION"
Fast Food is a crass capitalistic simulation of a particularly
American phenomenon -- the Fast Food Joint, (or "FFJ").
.s3
Players, ("tycoons"), choose plots on which to build FFJs,
(this is called "developing a plot").
Each player controls the development of a unique set of plots,
(see "view").
.s3
FFJs, once developed, are NOT the property of the developer;
they are independent entities.
.s3
When a plot is developed next to an existing FFJ a CHAIN is formed.
The newly formed chain issues stock, (100 shares), with 5 shares
going to the person who developed the second plot and the other
95 shares being put up for public sale.
.s3
The value of shares of stock varies with the size of the chain
and with trading activity in that stock, (see "price").
.s3
The stocks pay dividends based on the price of the stock,
(see "dividend").
.s3
When a plot is developed next to an existing chain that chain simply
increases in size.
.s3
When a plot is developed next to more than one existing chain the larger,
(or largest), chain merges with the smaller chain, (or chains), absorbing
it, (or them), (see "merger").
.s3
The game ends when no one can develop a plot; the winner is the person
with the highest net worth.
