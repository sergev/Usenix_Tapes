.TH MERGER
When a plot is developed that connects to two different chains
the smaller one is merged into the larger, forming a single large
chain unless both chains are too large to merge or there are
already too many chains in existence, (see "param").
.s3
The major holder in the merged out chain is given a
"major holder's bonus" and the minor holder is given a
"minor holder's bonus", (see "param").
Stock in the smaller chain is then traded two for one for
stock in the larger chain.
Any stock that can't be traded is sold back at the pre-merger price.
