.TH "NAME CHANGE COMMAND"
The name change command is used to change your "tycoon" name.
The general form of the command is:
.EX "name [ new-name ]"
If you don't specify the new name on the command line ff will prompt
you with "New name? ".  You may change your name to any character
string of 23 or fewer characters, but remember that you'll have to
type this name fairly often...
