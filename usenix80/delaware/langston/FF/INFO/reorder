.TH "REORDER PLOTS COMMAND"
The reorder command allows you to specify the order in which your plots
of land are to be developed into fast food joints.
The plot marked 0, (see "view"), is developed first, then the plot marked
1, etc.
Plot reordering is effected by switching pairs of plots.
To switch a single pair of plots use:
.EX reorder 4,0
which will switch plots 0 and 4.
.s3
To switch several pairs of plots use:
.NF
.EX reorder
Switch which pair? 4,0
Switch which pair? 1,4
Switch which pair?      (just hit [RETURN] to end)
.FI
which will put 0 where 4 was, 1 where 0 was and 4 where 1 was.
.s3
The time at which you last reordered the plots is recorded and used
at update time to determine whose plot should be developed first.
The person whose last plot reorder was the earliest will have the
first plot developed.
