.TH "TRADE COMMAND"
The trade command is used to buy or sell shares of stock.
The general form of the command is either:
.EX "trade [ buy [ chain_name [ number ] ] ]"
or
.EX "trade [ sell [ chain_name [ number ] ] ]"
There is a limit on the number of transactions,
(shares of stock bought or sold),
each player can make between updates, (see "constants");
the finance report shows the number of transactions
made by each player to date.
Only stock in existing chains can be traded.
