This version of Fast-Food is the first export version; therefore
I wish you luck, (and perseverence and patience and ...).

In brief, the modules are:

ffdef.h     Global definitions
ff.c        The Fast-Food mainline
ffglb.c     Allocation of global data areas
init.c      Initial set up of players, chains, etc
new.c       Used to add players to the game
update.c    The process that carries out player moves, mergers, etc
fix.c       Data file surgery program.
SUBS/*.c    Miscellaneous subroutines required.
INFO/*      On-line documentation, (playing instructions).
upfile      Log on message, (must be present else ff is "down").
run         Command file that should help getting the game compiled.
Makefile    If you have the same PWB "make" that we have you're in clover.

It's not unlikely that these routines require some obscure subroutines
that exist only in my library, (or on systems that already have Empire,
which probably uses all the same routines).  If you find subroutines
missing let me know and I'll endeavor to supply them.

1)      Change path names in "ffglb.c" to reflect your directory structure;
	a search for "/sys/games" should find all path names.
2)      If you don't have PWB "make" execute "run" and pray.
	If you do, then "chdir SUBS; make; chdir ..; make".
3)      Run "init" with update-time arguments and "-s" if you want
	updates on saturdays and sundays.  For example:
	    init 12:00 15:00
	This will set up updates at noon and 3 p.m. monday through friday.
4)      Run "new" with tycoon name and log-name for each player.
	For example:
	    new Scrooge joe
	    new "J.P. Flathead" psl
	    etc
5)      Now players can run "ff" to play the game.  Good Luck.
