    Dear Ex Starfleet Member:

    I understand that you were selected to "voluntarily"  retire
    from  the  crowded  ranks  of the Starfleet in order that I,
    having recently demonstrated my great prowess  to the Fleet,
    night  become  a  member.   I  also understand that you were
    chosen because of your inability  to  "deliver the goods" to
    those cowardly Klingons, Romulans, Vallicians, etc., etc.

    My hearty thanks for resigning your post as dead-wood of the
    Starfleet  to  make room for me.  It's about time you incom-
    petent, old fogies left the job of killing to virile, young,
    well-trained Cadets like myself.

    Again, my thanks for your retirement...
