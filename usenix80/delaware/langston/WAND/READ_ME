	Export Wander Tape

To compile Wander, scan through wanddef.h for path names, (a search for
"sys/games" should catch them), and adapt for your particular directory
structure.  Also modify the routines "myruid()" and "myeuid()" in
wandglb.c to return the "real" and "effective" user ids of the current
user.  (These are compared to determine "ownership" of the world being
wandered; if they are equal then ownership is assumed and debugging
verbs become active; see "wander.nr" for debugging verbs.)
If your system has the "tell()" system call, (and therefore the "ftell()"
routine in the standard I/O library works), rename "Fwander.o" to be
"wander.o".  If you don't have the "ftell()" routine working then
rename "NFwander.o" to be "wander.o".

Then:   cc -c -O wandglb.c
	cc -n wander.o wandglb.o -lS
	mv a.out wander

The "*.nr" files include "mac" for their macros, so commands of the form
"nroff misc.nr >misc.doc" will create the documentation.

I want to keep track of the distribution and usage of Wander, so:
The material on this tape is not to be distributed without explicit,
written permission from Peter Langston.

Let me know if I've overlooked anything, if something doesn't work,
or if further explanation would be helpful.
