Go-Moku is an oriental game of ancient origin, originally  played
by   placing  black  and  white  stones,  (sometimes  called  "go
stones"), on a board ruled into squares by  19  vertical  and  19
horizontal  lines,  (sometimes called a "go board").  Unlike many
western games the plays are made  on  the  intersections  of  the
lines, (rather than in the squares).

The computer version is played on a "board" labelled with letters
across  the  top and numbers down the side.  Moves are entered as
the letter and number of the desired spot.
E.g.   "j10" is a play in the exact center of a 19x19 board.

The object of the game is to get 5, (and ONLY 5), plays in a row.
Players  alternate  making  moves  on the board until one wins or
there is a draw, (note that a stalemate is  possible,  especially
on small boards).

The "gomoku" program is a learning program; it learns how to play
by  analysing its losses and watching out for them in the future.
Consequently, it will play rather badly for the first few  games,
knowing  only that it has lost when you get five in a row; but it
will be happy to lose to you since it can only  learn  by  making
mistakes, (much like people).

If you are not using an Interactive-modified OWL  terminal,  (one
with  an  "INTERACTIVE  text  editing machine" label), you should
execute gomoku by typing:
        % /sys/games/gomoku tty

Anytime you wish to have the board redisplayed, (if for any  rea-
son it gets messed up), type "?" in place of your move.

Have fun...
