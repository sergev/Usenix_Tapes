Grams is a game based on anagrams.

The computer selects a word and then rearranges the letters in the word
and prints out the result.

You then try to figure out the original word and type it in, (followed by
a [RETURN]).

If your word is the one the computer started with you win some points.
the number of points you get is based on how long it took you to find the
words.

If your guess is different from the original word you get to try again.

If you want to give up on a word just type an empty line, (hit [RETURN]).
The computer will tell you the word it had in mind and go on to the next.

At the end of ten rounds your score is reported; A score of 100 points
is considered pretty good.
