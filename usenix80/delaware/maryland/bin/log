The version 6 operating system kernal has been repaired
(sources are under /tmp/usr/sys and /user/kirby):
1. Deadlock is avoided in bio.c for read ahead buffering.
2. Orphan files in deleted directories are avoided.
3. Only the parent gets pending signals after fork.
4. tty.c raises priority to 5 before calling ttstart.
5. m34.s (instead of m40.s) properly saves the fpp registers.

The version 6 operating system kernal has been improved:
1. Only current range of active processes is searched
for wakeups.
2. The emptyp system call (used by re) is supported.
3. The readnl system call
(used by the optimized lisp and the optimized sh)
is supported.
4. The number of block io buffs has been raised to 17.
5. The stack size increment has been optimized to support LISP.
6. The current kill char also echos a newline,
but only in cooked echo mode.
7. The tape driver has had the bugs removed
and supports bidirectional file spacing.
8. putc in m34.s has been speeded up and
prints a console warning if the clist space is exhausted.

Currently the DZ-11 driver that supports modems used at UMCP
EE Department is included in the operating system.
The driver supplied by MJT is not properly configured.
Yet another driver is on the tape supplied by RLK.

Repaired or extended versions of the following system programs
have been installed:
tp dd icheck dcheck ncheck pwd mkdir find
(pr could be installed soon)

Programs and new inode names
have been added to support the expanded tape capabilities
(sources are in /tmp/sys/dos):
tdir eot bu rewind (dostape ldostape rdostape)

Other utilities have been added:
del copy move compare differ lisp

An improved version of the Yale shell has been installed including:
/etc/init /etc/glob_yale /bin/sh

nroff manuals that can be evoked by "man" are in /user/man/man? .

Source for the rand editor re (a screen editor)
currently set up for DATAMEDIA 2500 is in /tmp/rand.

LISP software is available in /user/kirby/l.

Because login would not allow sign-ons using the DZ-11s
several pieces of software were replaced with
the original versions (sources are in /user/kirby/source
and the old binaries are suffixed with .old):
/etc/getty /bin/login write who
