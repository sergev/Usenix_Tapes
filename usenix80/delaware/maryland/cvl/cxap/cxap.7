INTRODUCTION TO CXAP
.sp
CXAP is a group of C-callable subprograms.
It is modelled after the XAP USER'S MANUAL.
These subprograms permit basic I/O operations on picture files.
.sp
Each picture created by CXAP is comprised of a header section
and a picture section.  The header section is a 6 word
record (12 bytes) at the beginning of the picture file.
.sp
The picture section begins immediately after the header
section.
Each row of a picture, starting with the first row, is
stored as one logical record in the picture section.
Each picture row has the same length.
All CXAP pictures are stored sequentially, where
row k follows row k-1.
.sp
A CXAP picture file can be any one of five byte sizes.
A picture's byte size represents the number of bits needed
to store the largest picture value in a picture file.
Byte sizes are powers of 2, where the number of bits
per pixel can range from 1 to 16.
.sp
It is assumed that a user of CXAP has knowledge of
the C programming language.
In the subprograms contained in CXAP, all indexing begins at zero.
All information stored in arrays is stored in row-major order, i.e.,
the column increments the fastest.
All CXAP subprograms are functions and
return one of three values,
-1 on error, 0 on end-of-file and +1 on success.
.sp
The following are the subprograms in CXAP:
.sp
.en BREAD(VII) "read the next row of a bordered picture"
.en COPYDN(VII) "copy a row down"
.en COPYUP(VII) "copy a row up"
.en HEADER(VII) "obtain the header of a picture"
.en MWRITE(VII) "write multiple copies of a picture row"
.en PACK(VII) "pack the contents of a picture row"
.en PREAD(VII) "read the next n row(s) of a picture"
.en PWRITE(VII) "write the next n row(s) of a picture"
.en REX(VII) "read and extend a picture row"
.en SETUPB(VII) "open a picture file with a border surrounding it"
.en SETUPR(VII) "open a picture file for reading"
.en SETUPW(VII) "open a picture file for writing"
.en UNPACK(VII) "unpack the contents of a picture row"
.en XCLOSE(VII) "close a picture file"
.en ZWRITE(VII) "write a row of zeroes to output picture"
