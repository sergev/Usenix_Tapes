.sh DESCRIPTION
.lp +9 9
area	work area for CXAP
.lp +9 9
num	next
.it num
rows are read into
.it buffer
.s3
.lp +9 9
depth	maximum number of rows kept in
.it buffer
.lp +9 9
iw	user's input window
.lp +9 9

.it Pread
reads the next
.it num
rows of the picture associated with
.it area
into
.it buffer
provided that
.it iw[
3] is not exceeded.
Each row is written into
.it buffer[ptr[
0]] before the
.it ptr
vector is rotated.
.it Ptr
is rotated such that
.it ptr[
i] =
.it ptr[
i+1] for 0 <= i <
.it depth-
1 and
.it ptr[depth-
1] =
.it ptr[
0].
.s3
If
.it num
is less than 1 or if the more than
.it iw[
3] rows are read, an end-of-file will be returned.
.s3
Unlike
.it setupb,
.it buffer
must be primed by the user.
.it Depth
rows of the user's window must be read before
.br
.it buffer[ptr[
k]] (0 <= k <
.it depth)
will contain row k+1 of the input window.
.s3
Function value is -1 on error, 0 on end-of-file and +1 on
success.
