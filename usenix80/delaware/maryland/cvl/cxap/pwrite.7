.it Pwrite
writes out the next
.it num
rows of a picture.
The pixel values to be written are:
.s3
.br
.it vector[
0],...,
.it vector[num*iw[
2]-1].
.br
.s3
The pixels to be written are divided into
.it num
groups of
.br
.it iw[
2] pixels.
Group k (0 < k <=
.it num)
represents output row k.
.s3
If
.it num
is less than 1, an end-of-file is returned immediately.
.s0
The user may close a picture file prematurely
or exceed the
.it iw[
3]
count without any mishap.
The header in the picture will reflect the actual number
of rows written, as opposed to the number originally specified
in the
.it setupw
call.
.s3
Function value is -1 on error, 0 on end-of-file and +1 on
success.
