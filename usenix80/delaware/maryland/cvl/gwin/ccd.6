.sh NAME
ccd \*- GRINNELL Charge Coupled Device simulation
.sh SYNOPSIS
.bd
ccd
[size [r]]
.sh DESCRIPTION
A charge coupled device is a linear array of light sensors which are swept
across a visual field in order to produce a complete image.
.it
Ccd
simulates this by performing averaging along a row or column and sweeping
across the GRINNELL display. The averaging is performed on a power of two
neighborhood.
.s3
The size parameter is one of {2,4,8,16,32,64}.  The second parameter, if
present, causes the program to average along rows instead of columns.
