.sh NAME
getw \*- redisplay current GRINNELL window
.sh SYNOPSIS
.bd getw
[o]
.sh DESCRIPTION
.it Getw
is used to redisplay a window previously defined but subsequently erased.
Often after using
.it posw
to define a window a user will erase the overlay, hence making the window's
location difficult (if not impossible) to discern.
.it Getw
will output the
first column, first row, number of columns, and number of rows information
to the user's terminal and redraw the window (i.e., the borders)
on the display. If the optional argument
is given the cursors will be turned on but the overlay will not be erased.
