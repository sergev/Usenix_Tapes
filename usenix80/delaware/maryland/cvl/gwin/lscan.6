.sh NAME
lscan \*- display image cross section on the GRINNELL
.sh SYNOPSIS
.bd lscan
length [a]
.sh DESCRIPTION
.it
Lscan
will display a vertical or horizontal cross section through an image.
A graylevel image can be thought of as possessing three dimensions: height,
width, and brightness. This program is used to display the brightness
dimension as a cross section through one of the other two dimensions.
When this program is run a white line will appear on the screen. This line
is moved using the TRACK ball and cursor 1 to that portion of the image
through which the cross section is wanted. When the ENTER button on the
track ball unit is pushed twice, the cross section will appear on the screen
(in the overlay). This sequence can then be repeated.
.s3
The length parameter gives the width (or height) of the cross section.
If the second parameter is present, a vertical line will be used for
the cross section.
