.sh NAME
mapw \*- map GRINNELL window into itself through lookup table
.sh SYNOPSIS
.bd mapw
.sh DESCRIPTION
.it Mapw
is used to map the stored values of the window through the lookup table
and back into the stored values. That is, it transforms the stored values
as they are displayed so that they  actually take on the displayed
values. It is usually used after the lookup table has been changed
so that the lookup table can immediately
be reloaded with the standard sequence
of values.

incorrectly displayed.
