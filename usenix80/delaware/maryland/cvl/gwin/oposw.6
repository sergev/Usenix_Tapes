.th OPOSW VI 20-March-1980
.sh NAME
oposw \*- position a GRINNELL window without overlay
.sh SYNOPSIS
.bd oposw
[[fc fr] nc nr]
.sh DESCRIPTION
.it Oposw
is used to position the two cursors so as to
define a rectangular window on the GRINNELL
display. Cursor 1 defines the lower left
corner, cursor 2 defines the upper right
corner.
The overlay will NOT be disturbed.
This routine (or
.it posw)
is to be used before all other window oriented
programs.
.s3
The optional decimal parameters specify the window's size and location.
If none are given, they are chosen interactively by manipulating the
cursors with the TRACK ball until the ENTER button
is pushed twice.  If the size
.it nc
and
.it nr
(number of columns and rows) is given, only the position
is chosen interactively.  If the
.it fc
and
.it fr
(first column and first row) parameters are given,
the window's size and location are fixed.
