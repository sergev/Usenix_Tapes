This directory contains the source and manuals  for  a  group  of
programs which operate on the GRINNELL display.  Each of the pro-
grams manipulates a window, the position of which is  defined  at
the time of execution by the location of the cursors on the GRIN-
NELL display.  Thus, although the subroutines in the GXAP library
can  be  used  simultaneously  by  multiple  users, most of these
stand-alone programs cannot, since each user would be  using  the
same window.


Note that posw and oposw are the same program, and need  only  be
compiled once.
