.sh DESCRIPTION
.it Gcam
is used to input images into the GRINNELL display  memories.
Using  the  nfrms and shift parameters
a user can average as many
as 64 consecutive frames (up  to  255  can  be  summed).   Single
frames with no shift are input by setting nfrms to zero.
.s3
.it Area
is the buffer used in the
.it gopen
call,
.it nfrms
is the number of frames to sum (nfrms < 256), and
.it shift
is the amount to shift each frame before summing
(from 0 to 7).
The function value is zero if successful, non-zero if some error
occurred (operation not performed).
