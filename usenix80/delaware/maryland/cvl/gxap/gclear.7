.sh DESCRIPTION
.it Gclear
is used to clear  out  the  selected  subchannels  of  the
subwindow  of a GRINNELL   window. The first-column and first-row
parameters sent in the call are relative to  the  lower  lefthand
corner of the window set up by the
.it gopen
call. The subchannels to
be cleared are selected with the
.it subchan
parameter.   If
.it subchan
is  zero,  the  subchannels  as  defined  in  the area buffer are
cleared. The subwindow to be cleared can be as large as the whole
window  or  as  small  as one point (but no larger, and no smaller).
.it Area
is the buffer used in the
.it gopen
call.
.it Fcol
and
.it frow
are the column and row of the lower left-hand
corner of the subwindow to be cleared.
.it Ncol
and
.it nrow
are the number of columns and rows in the subwindow to be cleared.
.it Subchan
gives the subchannels to clear.  Note
that the window  is  not  cleared  when  the
.it gopen
function  is
invoked,  so it is a good idea to use the
.it gclear
call immediately
after opening, unless you want to manipulate data that is already
in your window.
.s3
The function value is zero if it succeeds, and non-zero if it fails.
