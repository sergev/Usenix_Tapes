.sh DESCRIPTION
.it Genter
is used to change the  default  values  for  the  channel,
subchannel  and write mode set up by the
.it gopen
call. On opening a
window,
.it gopen
will  select  the  image  channels (but not the overlay),  enable   all
subchannels,  select  a  dark  background, enable zero writes and
select single size pixels (1 point per pixel).
.it Genter
is used to change these values.  Any
parameters which are zero are left as is in the buffer.
.s3
.it Area
is the buffer used in the
.it gopen
call.
.it Channel
and
.it subchan
specify the channels and subchannels to enable.
.it Bakgnd
sets the background light if it is 1, and dark otherwise.
.it Zwrite
selects zero write if it is not 1.
.it Dsize
selects double size pixels if it is 1.
.s1
Care must be taken using double size I/O. If this  mode  is  set,
the logical window size is halved.
.s3
The value returned is zero if the call is successful, and non-zero
if it was not performed.
