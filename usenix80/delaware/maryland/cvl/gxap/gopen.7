.sh DESCRIPTION
.it Gopen
is used before all other  GAP  functions  to  set  up  the
user's
.it area
buffer  and  open the GRINNELL device. The function
parameters are used to define the physical window the  user  will
be  manipulating  on  the  display.  Though  errors  are detected
relative to the user's window, no overlaps  of  separate  windows
can  be discovered by the GAP functions.  When many users want to
use the display at the same time,  it  is  their  responsibility  to
maintain  the mutual integrity of their windows.  It is therefore
strongly recommended that the user input all parameters  for  the
.it gopen
function (with the exception of
.it area)
at  the  time  of
execution of the user's program.
.s3
.it Fcol
and
.it frow
define  the  lower  left-hand corner of the user's
window.  These are actual GRINNELL column and row
numbers and must be from 0 to 511.
.it Ncol
and
.it nrow
are the number of columns and rows in the user's window (maximum size = 512).
.s3
The value returned is zero if the call is successful, non-zero if it failed.
