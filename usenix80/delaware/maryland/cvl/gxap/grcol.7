.sh DESCRIPTION
.it Grcol
is used to read in a column from  the  user's  window.  The
values from the column specified are transferred from the display
and sent directly to the user's column buffer.
The number of points
to be read in should not violate the window's boundary. If too many
points  are requested an error condition will be returned and the
operation will not be done.
.s1
.it Area
is the buffer used in the
.it gopen
call.
.it Cbuf
is the user's integer  array  into which the values will be read.
.it Cnum
is the column  to be  read in  (relative to the left
of the window), and
.it cstart
is the row  to  start  reading  from  (relative to
the bottom of the window).
.it Npts
specifies the number of points to read in, and
.it inc
is the incremental distance between points.  If
.it inc
is negative the
pixels are read from top to bottom.
.s3
The function value is zero if it succeeds, and non-zero if it fails.
