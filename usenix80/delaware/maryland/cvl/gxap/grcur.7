.th GRCUR VII 18-March-1980
.sh NAME
grcur \*- read GRINNELL cursor positions
.sh SYNOPSIS
int
.bd grcur
(area, curbuf, asynch)
.s3
int area[16];
.br
int curbuf[4];
.br
int asynch;
.sh DESCRIPTION
.it Grcur
is used to read back the absolute (x,y) Cartesian coordinates of  the
two cursors into the user's buffer in the order (x1,y1,x2,y2). If
the
.it asynch
parameter is nonzero, grcur will not return until: (1)
The  track  ball is moved and the TRACK switch is on, or, (2) The
ENTER button is pushed. This mode is quite  useful  when  a  user
tries  to  track  a  changing cursor position. It also lowers the
load on the operating system.  If
.it asynch
is  zero,  the  cursor
positions  will  be immediately returned. Note that the positions
returned are absolute, not relative to the user's window.
.s3
.it Area
is the buffer specified in the
.it gopen
call.
.s3
The value returned is zero if successful, non-zero if the function
fails.
