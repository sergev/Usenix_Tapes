.sh DESCRIPTION
.it Grrow
is used to read in a row from  the  user's  window.  The
values from the row specified are transferred from the display
and sent directly to the user's row buffer.
The number of points
to be read in should not violate the window's boundary. If too many
points  are requested an error condition will be returned and the
operation will not be done.
.s1
.it Area
is the buffer used in the
.it gopen
call.
.it Rbuf
is the user's integer  array  into which the values will be read.
.it Rnum
is the row to be  read in  (relative to the bottom
of the window), and
.it rstart
is the column  to  start  reading  from  (relative to
the left of the window).
.it Npts
specifies the number of points to read in, and
.it inc
is the incremental distance between points.  If
.it inc
is negative the
pixels are read from right to left.
.s3
The function value is zero if it succeeds, and non-zero if it fails.
