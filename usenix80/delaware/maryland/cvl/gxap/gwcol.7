.sh DESCRIPTION
.it Gwcol
is used to write a column to a GRINNELL window.  The
values for the column specified are transferred from
the user's column buffer
and sent directly to
the display.
It  is
the  user's responsibility to make sure that the number of points
to be written will not violate the window's boundary. If too many
points  are requested an error condition will be returned and the
operation will not be done.
.s1
.it Area
is the buffer used in the
.it gopen
call.
.it Cbuf
is the user's integer  array  from which the values will be read.
.it Cnum
is the column  to be written to (relative to the left
of the window), and
.it cstart
is the row  to  start  writing in (relative to
the bottom of the window).
.it Npts
specifies the number of points to written, and
.it inc
is the incremental distance between points.  If
.it inc
is negative the
pixels are written from top to bottom.
.s3
The function value is zero if it succeeds, and non-zero if it fails.
