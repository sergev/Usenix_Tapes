.sh DESCRIPTION
.it Gwrow
is used to write a row to the  user's  window.  The
values from the user's row buffer are
sent directly to the display.
The number of points
to be written will not violate the window's boundary. If too many
points  are requested an error condition will be returned and the
operation will not be done.
.s1
.it Area
is the buffer used in the
.it gopen
call.
.it Rbuf
is the user's integer  array  from which the values will be read.
.it Rnum
is the row to be  written  (relative to the bottom
of the window), and
.it rstart
is the column  in which to start writing (relative to
the left of the window).
.it Npts
specifies the number of points to written, and
.it inc
is the incremental distance between points.  If
.it inc
is negative the
pixels are written from right to left.
.s3
The function value is zero if it succeeds, and non-zero if it fails.
