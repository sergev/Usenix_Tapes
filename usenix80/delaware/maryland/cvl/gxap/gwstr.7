.sh DESCRIPTION
.it Gwstr
is used to write a string of characters to  the  user's
window  starting  at relative location
.it (fcol,frow)
and proceeding
from left to right. The standard ASCII 64 character set is  used.
Each character can be thought of as a 7X9 box containing some bit
pattern.  As such, the last column which can be the  start  of  a
character  is  7  less  than  the number of columns in the user's
window. The last row is 9 less.  Characters are written into  the
selected subchannels of the enabled channels.
.s3
.it Area
is the buffer specified in the
.it gopen
call.
.it String
may be either a string or a pointer to a string.
.s3
The returned value is zero if successful, non-zero otherwise.
