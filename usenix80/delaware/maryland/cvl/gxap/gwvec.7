.sh DESCRIPTION
.it Gwvec
is used to write either a vector or a rectangle between two
points in the user's window, depending on the
.it rect
parameter. The
vector will be written into the subchannels  that  are  selected,
those  that  are  not  selected  will  be zero written unless the
.it genter
routine has been used to change this mode.
.s3
.it Area
is the buffer used in the
.it gopen
call.
.it Fcol
and
.it frow
specify the starting coordinates of the vector or rectangle, relative
to the window.
.it Lcol
and
.it lrow
give the endpoint.  If
.it rect
is non-zero, a rectangle will be drawn instead of a vector.
.s3
The function value is zero if it succeeds, non-zero if it fails.
