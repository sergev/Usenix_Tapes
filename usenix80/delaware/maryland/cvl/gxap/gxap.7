.sh NAME
gxap \*- GRINNELL applications package
.sh SYNOPSIS
cc [C-programs] -lg
.sh DESCRIPTION
.it GXAP
is a group  of  C  compatible  routines  which  simplify  the
interface  between  C  programs  and  the  GRINNELL GMR-27
display. Included in the package  are  functions  to  write  (and
read)  rows,  columns  or  points  to  (or  from) a window on the
display. With the exception of one, all the  functions  return  a
zero  value  when no errors occur, a negative value when an error
condition is detected. The one exception is
.it grpnt,
which  returns
a  12-bit  pixel value on no error. All the functions access a 16
integer buffer which is set up by the
.it gopen
function as a  window
descriptor.  More than one window may be open at one time as long
as each has its own descriptor (The  descriptors  should  not  be
used by the user's routines (except in GXAP calls) as they contain
information which is vital to the GXAP functions).
.s1
All  points  are  referenced  using  the
standard  Cartesian coordinate system. That is,
columns are numbered consecutively from left to  right  and  rows
are numbered from bottom to top in the display (NOT top to bottom
as with 1108 XAP). All numbering starts with zero (i.e.  (column
zero, row zero) is the lower lefthand corner of the display).
