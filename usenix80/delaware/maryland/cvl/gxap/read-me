This directory contains the source and manuals for a variety of C
subroutines  known  as the GXAP library.  Each of these functions
performs some operation relating to the GRINNELL  display.   Most
of  them  deal  only with a particular `window' of the display as
defined in the call to the `gopen' function.  The  use  of  these
windows allows the display to be used simultaneously by more than
one process without interference.  Note that  the  windows  exist
only in software, the GRINNELL does not recognize them.


Further information can be found in file gxap.7 in this  directo-
ry.


The programs should be compiled and combined into  a  single  li-
brary,  allowing  their  reference via the compile command -l op-
tion.  See libit, the command file used for that purpose.
