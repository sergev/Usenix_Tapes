.th BINOP VII "October 1979"
.sh NAME
binop \*- applies binary operation between two pictures
.sh SYNOPSIS
#include "binop.t"
.sh DESCRIPTION
.it Binop
contains the C source for a driver program which applies a point-wise
binary operation between two picture files with GAP style headers.
To construct a program:
.in +5
.sp
#include  "defns.t"
.br
#include  "binop.t"
.br
char  binop( p, q )  char  p, q;
.br
{ ...function for computing pointwise binary operation...}
.sp
.i0
.sp
The first file is read from standard input, the second from the file
argument given on the call, EXCEPT that if the file argument is
prefixed immediately with a hyphen ("-"), the order of the files is
reversed when applying the binary operator.  The result picture is
written to standard output.
.sh FILES
.in +5
.ti -5
binop.t - C source for driver
.ti -5
defns.t - useful definitions
.i0
.sh DIAGNOSTICS
.in +5
.ti -5
"File argument needed!"
.ti -5
"Can't open file argument!"
.ti -5
"First file not a byte per pixel file!"
.ti -5
"Second file not a byte per pixel file!"
.ti -5
"Picture files don't match!" - not the same size
.ti -5
"Premature end on first file!"
.ti -5
"Premature end on second file!"
.ti -5
"Excess data remaining on first file!"
.ti -5
"Excess data remaining on second file!"
.i0
.sp
In the above, "first file" normally means standard input,
and "second file" the file given as argument, but these roles
are reversed if the "-" prefix is used on the file argument.

.sh BUGS
.in +5
.ti -5
Only works for one byte per pixel files.
.ti -5
Read error will also cause "Premature end..." message.
.ti -5
Should have a facility for getting parameters, like local(VII).
