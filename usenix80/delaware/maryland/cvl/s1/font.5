.sh NAME
font \*- font file format
.sh DESCRIPTION
The format of the font files used by
.bd pgp
is as follows.
The first 512 bytes are 128 two word entries for the characters.
(numbered 0 - 127)
in each entry. The first word is the total character width,
including any white space.
The second word is the address of the character's definition
farther on in the file.
.sp 1
Starting at byte 512 there are:
.sp 1
.lp +10 5
The font height in pixels. (1 word)
.sp 1
.lp +10 5
The distance of the font's baseline from the top of the font. (1 word)
.sp 1
.lp +10 5
A null terminated ASCII string containing descriptive information
about the font.
.sp 1
.lp +0 0
The character definitions begin at byte 768. Each one consists of the
following one word fields, and the raster pattern.
.sp 1
.lp +10 5
Character code: Essentially a pointer back into the index table at
the beginning of the file.
.sp 1
.lp +10 5
Raster width: The number of pixels in one row of the character's raster
pattern.
.sp 1
.lp +10 5
Raster length: The number of pixels in one column of the character's
raster pattern.
.sp 1
.lp +10 5
Left overlap of the previous character.
.sp 1
.lp +10 5
Rows from top: The number of pixels at the top of the character
that are left blank, i.e. the vertical offset of the raster pattern.
.sp 1
.lp +10 5
The size of the raster pattern in bytes.
.sp 1
.lp +10 5
The raster pattern:
The pixels of the raster are stored starting with the upper left hand
pixel and proceeding to the right across each row. Each group of eight
pixels is stored in one byte, from the high-order to the low-order
bits. If a row of the raster does not fit into a group of
bytes evenly, the next row begins in the same byte.
Only the last byte of the raster is padded with unused bits.

The files look like this:
