.th LOCAL VII "October 1979"
.sh NAME
local \*- applies local operation to a picture
.sh SYNOPSIS
#include "local.t"
.sh DESCRIPTION
.it Local
contains the C source for a driver program which applies a
local operation to a picture file with GAP style header.
To construct a program:
.sp
.nf
(o)    #include  "defns.t"  (important definitions).

(i)    #define the following constants:
       O_HEIGHT  the vertical height of the local operator
		 in pixels;
       O_WIDTH   the horizontal width of the local operator
		 in pixels;
       O_BAKGND  the background filler value for border points
		 where the operator can't fit (typically zero);
       O_X_CNTR & O_Y_CNTR  the x & y co-ordinates of the "center"
		 of the operator (the output of the operator is
		 stored at the point in the output picture which
		 corresponds to the center).

N.B. All co-ordinates are strictly Cartesian: The x co-ordinate
increases from zero, left to right across the picture; and the y
co-ordinate from zero, bottom to top.  The picture is stored on
file by rows, with the first row (y=0) at the bottom of the picture.

(ii)   Declare global variables for storing operator parameters.

(iii)  Include a procedure:
		getpars( argc, argv ) int argc; char *argv[];
       for setting of the above global variables from the command
       line (using standard conventions for argc & argv).

(iv)   Include a function:
		char localop( nbd )  char *nbd[ O_HEIGHT ];
       which returns the result of the local operator.  Using
       zero-origin Cartesian co-ordinates, relative to the
       neighborhood, the point (x,y) can be accessed as
       nbd[y][x] inside localop.

(v)    #include "local.t"
.fi
.sp
The program reads the input picture from standard input and writes
the result to standard output. Both input and result pictures have
the same size.

.ti -5
"Input not a byte per pixel picture file!" - header not right
.ti -5
"Input picture too small for operator!" - picture smaller than neighborhood
.ti -5
"Premature end of input!" - picture smaller than expected from header
.ti -5
"Excess input data remaining!" - picture larger than expected from header

.ti -5
Only works for one byte per pixel files.

Read error will also cause "Premature end..." message.
