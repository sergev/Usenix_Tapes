.sh NAME
ms \*- generate `munching squares' patterns on the GRINNELL
.sh SYNOPSIS
.bd ms
start [ increment [ color ] ]
.sh DESCRIPTION
This program will generate a series of "munching squares" patterns on the
Grinnell.  The pattern uses the entire screen and its appearance
is determined by the parameters on the call line.  The
.it increment
and
.it color
values can be defaulted to one (1) and 4095, respectively.  The
.it color
argument is an integer between zero (0) and 4095 which is the value to be
place on the screen.
.s3
The algorithm can be best explained by the following program fragment:
.s3
	n := start;
	i := increment;

	FOR i := 0 TO lastx DO BEGIN
		FOR x := 0 to lastx DO BEGIN
			y := x XOR n;
			putpoint(x,y) END
		n := n + i END
.s3
where the routine "putpoint" puts a point at (x,y) on the display.  Different
values for
.it start
and
.it increment
produce different patterns.  Larger increments tend to produce finer grain
patterns, especially if the values are prime.
.s3
Once the above fragment completes its execution, the program will place
black points instead of colored ones and then repeats.  When this is complete,
the whole process is started over again.
