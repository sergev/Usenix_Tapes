tprint \*- print a thresholded GRINNELL display
.sh SYNOPSIS
.bd tprint
[a [a]]
.sh DESCRIPTION
.it
Tprint
produces standard output for the PRINTRONIX line printer of the
displayed image after it has been
thresholded
(i.e., through the lookup table) or of the overlay.
Depending on
the number of arguments the resulting print will be of the thresholded
image (no parameters), the complement of the thresholded image
(one parameter), or the complement of the overlay (two parameters).
Only the overlay may be printed without thresholding, the results
being undefined for a non-thresholded image.
