.th TRACK VI 4-October-1979
.sh NAME
track \*- tracks regions in Grinnell pictures
.sh SYNOPSIS
.bd track
.sh DESCRIPTION
.it Track
traces the borders of thresholded regions in a
Grinnell image.
The component to be tracked is selected manually by positioning cursor 1
inside a region and typing a threshold value.
.it Track
scans right from the cursor position until a below threshold
point is found.
Tracking begins at this point and continues counterclockwise around the
boundary of the region.
Border points are written to the Grinnell overlay so tracking may be
followed visually.
As many borders as desired may be tracked by repositioning the cursor
and entering a threshold.
Each border tracked outputs a string of integers seperated by blanks.
The first two integers are the X Y coordinates of the starting point.
Following the start point is the four-neighbor chain code for the border.
A \*-1 terminates the string for each border.
Entering a negative threshold terminates
.it track
and causes an
additional \*-1 to be printed as an end marker.
The chain code directions are shown in the diagram below.
