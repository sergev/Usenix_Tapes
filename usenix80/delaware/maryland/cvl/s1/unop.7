contains the C source for a driver program which applies a point-wise
unary operation to a picture file with GAP style headers.
To construct a program:
.in +5
.sp
#include  "defns.t"
.br
#include  "unop.t"
.br
char  unop( p )  char  p;
.br
{ ...function for computing pointwise unary operation...}

The input picture is read from standard input,
The result picture is
written to standard output.
Can be used for making filters.

.sh DIAGNOSTICS
.in +5
