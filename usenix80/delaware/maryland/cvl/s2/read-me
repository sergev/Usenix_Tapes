These three directories contain miscellaneous picture  processing
and  GRINNELL  manipulation  programs.  S1 holds several GRINNELL
demonstrations along with some programs for printing the  display
on the PRINTRONIX line printer.  S2 contains programs for manipu-
lating the GRINNELL display, which get TV input, change the mode,
and  modify  the  look-up  table.  S3 contains several ``doodle''
type programs for the display, along with some minor picture pro-
cessing programs, and two programs using font files.
