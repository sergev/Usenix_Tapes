.sh NAME
scale \*- interactive grayscale mapping
.sh SYNOPSIS
.bd scale
.sh DESCRIPTION
.it
Scale
is used to interactively change the hardware lookup table graylevel
mapping. The x-axis of the monitor screen is considered to represent the
possible range of displayed (through the lookup table) pixel values.
The y-axis is considered
to represent the actual stored value range. Hence if one were to plot the
mapping function of the standard lookup table values a 45 degree line starting
at the origin and proceeding to point (511,511) would result. Using the TRACK
ball and cursor 1 this function can be interactively changed (i.e., the line
can be redrawn) allowing any graylevel mapping such as multiple thresholds,
contrast stretching, etc.
