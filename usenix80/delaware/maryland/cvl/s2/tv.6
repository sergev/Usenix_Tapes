.th TV VI 6-March-1980
.sh NAME
tv \*- turn on GRINNELL video digitizer
.sh SYNOPSIS
.it tv
.sp 0
.it freeze
.sh DESCRIPTION
.it Tv
is used to turn on and start input into the GRINNELL memory from the video
digitizer. In usual practice the digitizer's input comes from the T.V.
camera, but video disk and tape units can also be used as input devices.
.it Tv
will continue inputting data at the standard frame rate (30 frames/second)
until
.it freeze
is used. Because
.it tv
configures the GRINNELL hardware registers in a certain way, it should always
be followed by a
.it freeze.
