Linefeeds in the input text are ignored, they will
.ul
not
produce spaces. Control characters may be entered by typing a ``%''
before the appropriate letter, i.e.: ``%a'' for control-a.
.sp 1
.it "     Biglet"
precedes each line of output with a control-``F'', which will put
the Printronix into 8-lpi mode so that the raster pattern is more
square than it would be otherwise.
