.sh NAME
descfnt \*- describe the contents of a font file
.sh SYNOPSIS
descfnt <fontname> [ <sample-character> ]
.sh DESCRIPTION
.it "     Descfnt"
has two modes: If it is invoked with one argument it reads the font
file named by the argument, lists all the ASCII characters which
are defined in the font, and prints the descriptive information
stored in the font file.
If it is invoked with two arguments it takes the first one as a
font name -- as before -- and displays the raster of the
font character
corresponding to the second argument, in this form:
