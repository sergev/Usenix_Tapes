.th DIRN VI "October 1979"
.sh NAME
dirn \*- edge gradient direction
.sh SYNOPSIS
.bd dirn
file2
.sh DESCRIPTION
.it Dirn
reads one picture from standard input, and a second picture from the
file given as argument. It computes
.sp
.ti +10
atan2( y, x )
.sp
scaled to be in the range -128 to +127 (instead of -pi to +pi),
at each point of the output picture, where x and y are the values at
the corresponding points in the two input pictures.
If x and y are signed edge detector outputs in x and y directions
respectively, then this gives the edge gradient direction
measured in 256ths of a revolution.
Note that this will use all 8 bits of a byte.
The result picture is written to standard output.
All files have GAP style headers.
