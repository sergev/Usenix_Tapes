.sh NAME
euc \*- euclidean combination of two pictures (L2 norm)
.sh SYNOPSIS
.bd euc
file2
.sh DESCRIPTION
.it Euc
reads one picture from standard input, and a second picture from the
file given as argument. It computes
.sp
.nf
		     ------------
		    /  2     2
		   /  x  +  y
		 \\/

.fi
at each point of the output picture, where x and y are the values at
the corresponding points in the two input pictures.
If the result of this expression is greater than 63, it is set to 63.
The output picture is written to standard output.
All files have GAP style headers.
.sp
Useful for combining the output of edge operators in x and y directions.
