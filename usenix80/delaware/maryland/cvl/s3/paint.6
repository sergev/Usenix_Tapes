.th PAINT VI 4-April-1980
.sh NAME
paint \*- paint a picture (paint by numbers)
.sh SYNOPSIS
.bd paint
filename
.sh DESCRIPTION
.it Paint
is the last step in the ``paint by numbers'' series of programs.  It
allows the file created by
.it draw, binin,
and
.it connect
to be colored in.
Cursor 1 should be on, and cursor 2 off.
.it Paint
displays the picture as a line drawing in the lower left hand corner of
the Grinnell's screen, and displays a palette in the upper right hand corner.
.s3
To mix colors the cursor must be positioned within the block of the palette
containing the three primary color bars. You can either leave the track switch
off, move the cursor over any color bar to the desired length of the bar and
hit the
.it enter
button, or you may leave the track switch on, and position
the cursor over any color bar and move it up or down while the color bar
changes length along with it. The currently selected color is continuously
displayed in a rectangle at the top of the palette.
.s1
To color in a region of the picture
with the current color, move the cursor (while the track switch
is off) to any point within that region, and press
.it enter.
No more commands may be given to the program until that region has been
colored in.
The same color may be used to color any number of regions without needing to
reselect the color. A region may be recolored any number of times; the
previous color in the region will be overwritten completely.
.s3
When you are done painting, exit by pressing the
<rubout>
key on your terminal. The palette will be erased, and the borders between the
components will be erased and then filled in, by blending the colors of the
adjacent regions.
