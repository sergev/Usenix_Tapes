.th TEMPERA VI 14-August-1979
.sh NAME
tempera \*- allows one to `paint' on Grinnell using trackball as `brush'
.sh SYNOPSIS
tempera
.sh DESCRIPTION
.it TEMPERA
is a program that simulates tempera painting.
The screen of the Grinnell monitor is the "canvas;"
the "paintbrush" is the trackball device.
The artist may direct a "palette" to appear on the screen,
when it is desired to electronically mix another color of "paint."
At the beginning of the program, the artist may choose
.it either
subtractive color mixing (primary colors: cyan, magenta, yellow)
.it or
additive color mixing (primary colors: red, green, blue)
.it or
a "premixed" palette (a faster way of choosing
colors), to be used throughout the painting as the basis
for mixing paints.
For a simulation of tempera painting, the artist should specify the
.it subtractive
color mixing method, since tempera paints are opaque pigments
that absorb (i.e. subtract) light.
The color-mixing algorithm the program employs blends colors
to produce the same color as would result if real paints were mixed.
.s1
The artist switches between the "palette" mode and the "painting" mode
by pressing the ENTER button on the trackball twice.
When the program reads the same position twice in a row, it takes
this as an indication that a mode change is desired.
.s1
While in the "palette" mode, use the trackball in this way:
turn the TRACK switch on the trackball OFF.
To select a color, superimpose the cursor on the desired color
and press the ENTER button once.
To select a control option (one of the four boxes with writing),
position the cursor inside the box you are choosing, and
press the ENTER button once.
.s1
While in the "painting" mode, the ends (width) of the "paintbrush"
are defined by the positions of the two cursors.
To adjust width of brush, turn TRACK switch off.
Turn either of the two cursors off (they are controlled by the
toggle switches labeled "1" and "2" on the trackball.)
Move trackball to reposition the cursors, and then turn the
cursors back on.
To adjust the position of the brush (to move the brush
.bd without
painting):
turn TRACK switch off.
Spin the trackball to move the "brush" to desired place.
Turn TRACK switch on.
Moving the trackball now will start painting at the cursors.
