.sh SYNOPSIS
.bd bu
[
.bd \*-special
] [
.bd \*-N
] [
.bd count
]
.sh DESCRIPTION
.it Bu
backs up magtape to the file before the current one.
If a previous file exists,
the tape is left positioned just after the end-of-file (EOF)
or beginning of tape that begins the file.
If the tape was already at the beginning of tape,
then
.it bu
prints an error message.
.s3
Alternative names for
.it bu
such as
.it bu4
provide a different default tape device
according to the last digit of the name.
.s3
The options either specify a non-default backup device
or provide for multiple file backup:
.s3
.lp +9 9
-special	backs up the given special file instead of
default ``/dev/bu_rmt0''.
.lp +9 9
-N	backs up magtape raw device ``/dev/bu_rmtN''
where the one digit octal number N gives the unit number (default 0).
If N is omitted 4 is used.
.lp +9 9
count	backs up over count file marks
instead of the default of one.
A leading zero specifies an octal number.
If only a zero is given,
.it bu
takes no action.
.i0
.fi
.sh DIAGNOSTICS
Complains if the beginning of tape is reached
before the file count is exhausted
or if the tape drive is offline or already occupied.
If interrupted,
.it bu
displays a count of files that have been backed up over.
