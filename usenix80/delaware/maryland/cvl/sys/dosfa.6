.sh DESCRIPTION
.it Dosfa
is a filter that converts
DOS formatted ASCII input to UNIX standard ASCII output.
The format resembles that used
by DEC operating systems RT-11, DOS/BATCH-11, and RSX-11.
After eliminating any parity bit,
each carriage return (015) line feed (012) pair
is converted to a single line feed (012).
NULL (0) characters are also eliminated.
All other characters are passed through as is.
.it Dosfa
eliminates the unnecessary carriage returns read by
.it rdostape
from tapes produced by DOS.
