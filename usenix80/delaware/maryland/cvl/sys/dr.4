.th DR IV 3-January-1977
.sh NAME
dr \*- DR11-B Direct Memory Access Device
.sh DESCRIPTION
This file refers to the DR11-B as used at the 
Computer Vision Laboratory of the University of Maryland.
.s3
The
.it rdr0
(or
.it dr0
)
file is used to output pictorial information to the
scan conversion memory for display purposes.

.it Explanation
on how to set up the device to receive 
image data from the PDP11/45 is beyond the
scope of this description and should be sought from
someone familiar with the procedure.
.s3
When the file is opened, a RESET command is sent to the 
device. Upon closing of the file, a DISPLAY command will be sent.
.s3
This being a 
.it display
device, the user is restricted to only writing on the file.
Seeking in the forward direction is totally ignored. Seeking
in the reverse direction causes a RESET command to be sent
to the device (Thus resetting the device counters and disabling
the scanner until the RESET button on the device itself is pushed).
.s3
Caution must be taken to set up the device switches themselves
correctly. If they are incorrect, in some situations the call
on the device will sleep with an un'kill'able priority
until they
.it are
correct, thus causing untold frustration and anxiety.
.s3
To use the scanner correctly,
each pixel should be left justified in the byte
written out.
(For example, a 64-greylevel picture should have each pixel's
value shifted left 2 bits (multiplied by 4).)
.s3
About four seconds after no data has been sent to the
scanner, it will display what has been sent. This 
does not disable the scanner from receiving more data
from your program. It is only a convenience feature
with no side effects.

.sh BUGS
The switches for the number of columns on the scan device
must be set to one less than the actual number of columns
sent from the PDP11/45.
The picture will still all come out.
Care must be taken to write out your picture to the scanner
in even sized chunks, odd byte counts causing an immediate
system error. This means, of course, that it is impossible to send
out an image that has an odd number of rows
.it and
an odd number of columns.
