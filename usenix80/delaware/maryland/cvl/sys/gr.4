.sh NAME
gr \*- DR-11 interface to Grinnell display processor GMR-27
.sh DESCRIPTION
.it Gr
refers to the modified DR-11B interface to the Grinnell display
processor, GMR-27.
The interface supports both synchronous and asynchronous I/O
as a character device only.
Synchronous requests are satisfied in a limited time.
Asynchronous requests may be delayed until some
external condition is satified,
such as the CURSOR ENTER button being pressed.
In synchronous I/O,
the buffer
.it must
begin on a word boundary
and the count
.it must
be even.
Seek calls for the file
.it gr
are meaningless.
.s3
Each word written to the file
.it gr
commands the GMR-27 to perform one operation
(except when using packed bytes).
Each write is done as a single DMA transfer.
.s3
The interface performs synchronous reading in a non-standard manner.
The buffer used to synchronously read words from the GMR-27
must begin with command words which are first sent to the GMR-27
to enable reading.
The last of these command words must be readback peripheral data (RPD),
0160000 (octal).
All words following the first RPD in the buffer receive data words
from the GMR-27.
If no RPD command resides in the buffer
or the first RPD is the last word in the buffer,
.it read
returns an error condition without sending any commands to the GMR-27.
The byte count returned from a synchronous
.it read
includes the initial command words
which were written to the GMR-27.
In order to protect UNIX from being stalled by an improperly
programmed synchronous read command performing asynchronous I/O
or using non-existant GMR-27 peripheral devices,
the interface limits the duration of synchronous reading.
If the GMR-27 does not complete a synchronous
.it read
request promptly,
the interface interrupts the DMA transfer and returns
a shortened
.it read
byte count.
Such an incomplete
.it read
count should be considered as an error.
To avoid unnecessarily tying up UNIX,
processes should not use synchronous
.it read
calls which may need to be interrupted.
.s3
Processes may also wait for asynchronous events
by reading with a byte count of exactly two.
In order to intercept GMR-27 asynchronous events,
the interface enables the GMR-27 "interrupt" peripheral device
with a select peripheral device (SPD), 0122000 (octal),
issues an RPD command, and requests a data word transfer
from the GMR-27.
Waiting for an asynchronous event,
the GMR-27 delays returning a data word until a user either
presses the
.it enter
button or moves the trackball with the
.it track
switch on.
Between synchronous I/O requests,
until the interface receives an "interrupt" word,
the interface waits in a background mode
for an asynchronous event.
After an asynchronous event,
all waiting processes receive the "interrupt" word.
After an asynchronous event,
synchronous reads can elicit the cause of the event and
reset the interrupt flags within the GMR-27.
.s3
Since multiple opens are permitted,
the state of the GMR-27 may unexpectedly change between
the I/O requests of any one process.
Also,
the background asynchronous I/O processing may alter
the selection of peripheral devices with an SPD
after each synchronous I/O request.
Thus,
each I/O request is responsible for reestablishing the volatile state
of the GMR-27 whenever simultaneous operations could occur.
Some volatile elements of the GMR-27 state which may need to be reset
include:
.br
	1) Display channel (LDC) and subchannel mask (LSM) selection,
.br
	2) Write (LWM) and update (LUM) modes,
.br
	3) Element (LER, LEA, LEB, and LEC)
and line (LLR, LLA, LLB, and LLC) registers, and
.br
	4) Selection (SPD) and use (LPR, LPA, and LPD) of
some GMR-27 peripherals.

The volatile GMR-27 peripheral devices include:
.br
	1) Memory readback,
.br
	2) Independent cursor locations and flags, and
.br
	3) Byte unpacking.
.br
To avoid interference with other I/O,
byte unpacking should be completed by single I/O transfers.
.s3
Other GMR-27 peripheral devices
which have global effects are manipulated less often.
Since all users should agree to their invocation,
these devices and commands need not be reset or reissued
with each I/O request:
.br
	1) Graphic digitizer (camera input),
.br
	2) Video control (color vs grayscale),
.br
	3) Video lookup table,
.br
	4) Internal self-tests,
.br
	5) Screen and line erasure, and
.br
	6) Scrolling.
.s3
With simultaneous users,
by convention,
each user should insure that only allocated GMR-27 display memory
is altered.
Mutual user consent should be obtained before changing
global GMR-27 states.

.sh BUGS
The DR-11B interface hardware must be modified
so that stalled DMA transfers may be safely terminated.
This modification,
which connects one of the unassigned function bits to ATTN,
must be made before reading is attempted.
.s3
The driver could establish a starting image position
before each transfer
(in GMR-27 registers Ec and Lc perhaps).
