.sh DESCRIPTION
.it Ldostape
lists a directory for magtape in
DEC's DOS/BATCH-11 Peripheral Interchange Program (PIP) format
starting at the current tape position.
The format resembles that used
by DEC operating systems RT-11, DOS/BATCH-11, and RSX-11.
For each file,
.it ldostape
converts the radix-50 filename in the header
into six ASCII characters followed by a dot(.) and three characters
for the extension.
Alphas are converted to lower case.
The radix-50 codes 0, 033, 034, and 035 are converted into
blank( ), dash(\*-), dot(.), and question mark(?) respectively.
The extension is followed by a user identification code (UIC) in brackets,
the octal  protection code in angle brackets,
and a decimal version of the Julian date based on 1970.
.s3
The tape is left positioned after the tape mark for the last file read
or immediately after the double file mark at end-of-tape (EOT).
.s3
The options either specify a non-default input device
or limit the files to be included in the directory listing:
.s3
.lp +9 9
-special	search the given special file instead of
default ``/dev/nrw_rmt0''.
.lp +9 9
-N	search non-rewinding magtape raw device ``/dev/nrw_rmtN''
where the one digit octal number N gives the unit number (default 0).
.lp +9 9
-cN	only list information for the next N files.
.lp +9 9
-uN	only print information for files with user ID N in the header
skipping files with other IDs.
.lp +9 9
-gN	only print information for files with user group ID N in the header
skipping files with other IDs.
