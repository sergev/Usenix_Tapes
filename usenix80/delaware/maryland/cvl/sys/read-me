This tape contains a variety of programs, subroutines, and utili-
ties developed at the University of Maryland Computer Vision Lab.
The tape consists of four files.  Because the standard UNIX  tape
handler  will  not  handle more than one file per tape, the first
file consists of the material necessary to read the remainder  of
tape,  i.e.,  tape handler and utilities.  These include bu, eot,
ht, rewind, skp, tdir, and tm.  Note that the  following  conven-
tions are used throughout the tape for filename extensions:

         .c -- C source program
         .f -- Fortran source program
         .lsp -- Lisp source program
         .1 thru .8 -- manual segments formatted for use with the
         man___ processor.


In addition to the tape drivers, this first  file  also  contains
information on the GRINNELL GMR-27 display which many of the pro-
grams use.  This includes a driver and three source files of  de-
finitions.  There are also several programs for use with DEC for-
mat tapes (*dos*).

Each directory has a read-me file with further  documentation  on
its  contents.  The second file holds directories cxap, gxap, and
gwin.  The third file holds directories s1, s2, and s3.  The last
file holds directory quadtree.
