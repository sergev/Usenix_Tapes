.it Xapin
reads a raw-formatted picture from tape devices /dev/srmt? or /dev/rmt?.
The resulting output picture will be located in
.it file
in the conventional CXAP format.
.s3
All arguments which are not given are defaulted.
.it fc,
.it fr,
.it ci,
and
.it ri
are defaulted to 1.
.it nc
is set the length of the first picture row on the input tape if left
defaulted. It is
crucial that all records on the input tape be the same length because
no checking is performed to ensure this.
.it nr
is defaulted to 1024.
.s3
Each pixel will be read from the input tape as one byte of information
and converted to integer as defined by C.
The picture byte size will be 4, indicating 8 bits per pixel.
.s3
If the default or user supplied values for
.it nc
and
.it nr
exceed the user window, they are
changed to reflect the actual size of the input picture.
.s3
All end-of-file marks terminate
.it xapin
normally, with some parameters (as mentioned above) being modified
as needed.  Errors terminate
.it xapin
abnormally resulting in the output of an error
message and the status of the last executed function call.
