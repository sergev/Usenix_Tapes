Instructions for making a Table of Contents for online manuals.


Note:  These instructions assume you wish to make a complete listing for
       all manual sections.

The table of contents generator uses several large files on /tmp/man/man0.
They are toc?, tocx?, and ptxx.

Give the command

	sh tocrc all

to start the table of contents generator.
When it finishes, the files tocx? may be deleted.  Then generate the permuted
index with

	nroff ptx.new|spaces|opr +n       (for n copies)

Now delete the file ptxx.  Finally, create the table of contents itself with

	nroff toc.new|spaces|opr +n       (for n copies)

and delete the files toc?.  This completes the generation of the table of
contents and permuted index.
