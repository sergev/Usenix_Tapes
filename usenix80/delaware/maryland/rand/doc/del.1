.sh DESCRIPTION
.it Del
echoes the names of all files mentioned in the command line.
It then waits for a character (e.g. newline) from the standard input
as confirmation that those files should be deleted.  If too many
files would be deleted, hit the <DEL> key to abort the command.
Otherwise rm (I) is invoked to delete the files.
