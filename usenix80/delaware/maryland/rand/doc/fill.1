.th FILL I 9/17/76
.sh NAME
fill \*- fill arbitrarily indented paragraphs of text
.sh SYNOPSIS
.it fill
\[args...]
.sh DESCRIPTION
Fill is a filter intended for use with the <EXEC>
function of the Rand editor (re). It reads text from the
standard input file, fills each paragraph, and writes the
result on the standard output file.
.s3
Fill passes its text lines to nroff to be filled.
Options are identical to nroff, except that hyphenation
is normally turned off, all escape characters are set to
tilde, so as not to alter your text unexpectedly, and
paging is disabled.
.s3
Fill attempts to deal correctly with indented paragraphs.
It will always indent the first and second lines of a
paragraph exactly as they are indented in the source
text, and will line up all subsequent lines with the
second line. It will also treat all multiple spaces and
tabs within a line as single spaces. This may have
undesired effects in rare cases, but the general effect
is to allow the user to correct already-filled
paragraphs, and then refill the text. (The special
treatment of indented paragraphs may be defeated; see
below.)
.s3
It is also possible to enter a paragraph of raw text, in
free format, starting the first two lines at the proper
indentations, and then use fill to fill the entire
paragraph.
.s3
As an example, this entire file, except for the first
four lines, can be passed through fill any number of
times without altering it.
.s3
Fill may be given one or more arguments. If the argument
begins with a ".", it is taken to be an nroff command
line and passed directly to roff. (If the argument does
not begin with ".", it is given to nroff as an argument;
it is not clear that this is useful, however.)
.s3
Example: to fill with hyphenation:
.s3
.br
	     fill ".hy 1"
.s3
Example: to fill lines between columns 10 and 70:
.s3
.br
	     fill ".in 10" ".ll 70"
.s3
If one of the arguments to fill is the single character
"x", fill will not attempt to process indented paragraphs
correctly or remove multiple spaces before passing the
text to nroff. Nroff will receive the text exactly as it
appears in the source file.
.s3
It is not possible to change the escape characters by an
argument to fill.
.s3
The source code for fill is the same as the source code
for just, with the compile-time defined constant JUST set
to 1.  The source file is named fill.c
.sh DIAGNOSTICS
If fill is unable to create its temporary file, fill
exits with status -2. This is the standard error return
for re's <EXEC> command.
