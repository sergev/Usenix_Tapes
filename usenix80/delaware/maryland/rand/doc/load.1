.th LOAD I 16-Jan-75
.sh NAME
load \*- compile and load
.sh SYNOPSIS
.bd load
arg1 arg2 ...
.s3
.bd load
.sh DESCRIPTION
.it Load
takes a list of arguments (flags or filenames)
and sends them to the c compiler
.it (cc)
after appending, if necessary,
the correct extension (.c or .o) to the filenames.
The resulting object code is loaded.
Any previous a.out file is removed before compilation.
.s3
The command string is remembered, so that subsequent invocations of
.it load
with no arguments will use the arguments from the most recent
non-empty call.
.s3
.it Load
passes all arguments preceded by a '-' to
.it cc
without further procssing; that is,
.it cc
flags are handled correctly.
.sh FILES
.lp +20 20
/tmp/compil?.<uid>	where <uid> is the user id returned by getuid().
Used to save the current argument string.
? is the teletype id found by ttyn().
.sh "SEE ALSO"
.lp +10 10
ex(I)	like load but it executes resultant a.out file
.br
.i0
.fi
cc(I), getuid(II), ttyn(III)
.sh DIAGNOSTICS
mainly self-explanatory
.sh BUGS
The same command file /tmp/compil.<uid> is used for the
.it ex
and
.it load
commands. This is necessary for the convenience of the
Rand Editor (re).
.s3
Arguments limited to 20 characters.  This will be fixed eventually.
