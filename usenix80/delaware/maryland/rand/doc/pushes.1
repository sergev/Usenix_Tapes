.sh DESCRIPTION
Each re session generates a file of all the buttons that were pushed
during that session in the file /tmp/retty<n>.<UID>,
where <n> is the name of the terminal used
and <UID> is the user name obtained by getuid().
This file may be copied or moved to some
temporary name in the user's directory.
When
.it pushes
is applied to
this file it produces a list of interpreted button pushes on the
standard output unit.
.sh FILES
/tmp/retty?.<UID>
.br
When recompiled it assumes the existence of the file
ned.defs to find the current key assignments.
.sh BUGS
It should be possible to invert this function.
