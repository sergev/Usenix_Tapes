.th RPL I 17-Jan-76
.sh NAME
rpl \*- replace all occurrences of a string in a file
.sh SYNOPSIS
.bd rpl
expr substitute
.sh DESCRIPTION
.it Rpl
is a filter, intended for use with the <EXEC>
key of the Rand editor (re).
.it Rpl
reads the standard
input,  and  writes  on  the  standard  output  the  file
obtained  by  replacing  all occurrences of the character
string which is its first argument by the string which is
its second argument. Remember to use quotes to enclose an
argument containing spaces.
.s3
.it Rpl
recognizes regular expressions in its first argument.
Thus, to delete all sequences of blanks at the
beginning of lines, type
.s3
.ti +10
rpl "^ *" ""
.s3
This means that the characters ^ $ @ * [ and ] must be
preceeded by \ to be recognized in the first argument of
.it rpl.
For the definition of regular expression, see ed(I)
in the UNIX Reference Manual (except N.B.:
.it rpl
uses @ instead of . to match any character).
.s3
To delete a string using rpl, replace it by the null string "".
.sh DIAGNOSTICS
If lines are longer than 256 characters, if two arguments
are not given, or if the first argument is the null
string,
.it rpl
exits with status -2. This is the standard
error return for re's <EXEC> command.
