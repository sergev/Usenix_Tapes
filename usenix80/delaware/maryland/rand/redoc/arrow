			<ARROW KEYS>

The arrow keys move the cursor without erasing characters.
The cursor will move


	/\  up one line
	ll

	ll  down one line
	\/

	->  forward one column


	<-  back one column


with one press of the respective arrow key.  You keep pressing
the arrow keys until the cursor is in the desired location.
The cursor may be moved with arrow keys in both normal and
insert mode.

Note that if you continue to move the cursor via an arrow key
past the end of the line in view, the cursor reappears at the
beginning of the same line, i.e. it wraps around.
