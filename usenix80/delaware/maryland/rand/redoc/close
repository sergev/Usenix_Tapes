			<CLOSE>

The <CLOSE> function permits your to remove lines, columns
and areas defined by lines and columns.

Lines
-----

(1) Pressing
	<CLOSE>
removes the line on which the cursor is currently located and
saves it in a buffer.  All lines following the rmoved line
move up 1 line.  The cursor remains in the same position.
For example, if you had typed

	----------
	|horse
	|_
	|cow
	|

and then decided you wanted the text single spaced instead of double
spaced, you move the cursor to the blank line and press <CLOSE> to
remove it.

	----------
	|horse
	|cow
	|_
	|

(2)  Typing
	<ARG> n <CLOSE>
allows you to remove n lines with one action.  If you
	1) Press <ARG>
	2) Type 5
	3) Press <CLOSE>
you will remove 5 lines starting at the current cursor position.

If you enter a non-integer argument to a <CLOSE> the
following message will appear at the bottom left of
the screen:
	**** Argument must be numeric ****
Repeat the function providing an integer as an argument.

If you enter a negative integer as an argument to a <CLOSE>
the following message will appear:
	**** Argument must be positive ****.
Repeat the function providing a positive integer as an argument.

(3)  Typing
	<beg. pos> <ARG> <end pos> <CLOSE>
where <beg. pos> is defined by the current cursor position and
the <end pos> is indicated by moving the cursor using the
cursor motion buttons, also allows you to rmove one or more lines.
The <end pos> of the cursor MUST be in the same column, different
line as the <beg. pos>; otherwise an area is removed (see below)
rather than just lines.

Partial lines, delimited on the left by the current cursor
position (<beg. pos>) and on the right by the end of the line,
may be removed and replaced by the entire following line by
typing:
	<beg. pos> <ARG> <CLOSE>

For example, by placing the cursor under the 'x' below

	---------------------
	|and the disk xyz
	|ran away
	|with the spoon.
	|

and typing <ARG> <CLOSE>, the following appears:

	---------------------
	|and the disk xyz
	|ran away with the spoon.
	|

Columns
-------

To remove columns on a line type:
	<beg. pos> <ARG> <end pos> <CLOSE>
where <beg. pos> is defined by the current cursor position
and the <end pos> is indicated by moving the cursor using
the cursor motion buttons, <TAB> or <horizontal arrows>.
The <end pos> of the cursor MUST be on the same line, different
column as the <beg. pos>; otherwise an area is removed (see
below) rather than just columns.

Columns may also be removed by using the <INSERT> <GOBBLE>
functions (see INSERT).  However, once columns are removed
in this manner they cannot be recovered.  Text removed by
<CLOSE> can be reinserted as explained below.

Areas
-----

To remove an area of text, type:
	<beg. pos> <ARG> <end pos> <CLOSE>
where <beg. pos> is defined by the current cursor position and
the <end pos> is indecated by moving the cursor using any of
the cursor motion buttons, <TAB>, <BACKTAB>, <horizontal/
vertical arrows>, and <CR>.  The <end pos> of the cursor
MUST be in a different column and on a different line than
the <beg. pos>; otherwise either lines OR columns are removed
rather than an area.

Recovery of Removed Text
------------------------

You may remove text using <CLOSE> and then re-insert or recover
it in case of error.  Typing
	<ARG> <PUT>
will put back in the file at the current cursor position the
text last deleted by a <CLOSE>.  If no text has been deleted
the message
	**** Nothing in the CLOSE buffer ****
appears at the lower left of the screen.

All text CLOSEd and PICKed during the current editing session is
saved in a special file named '#'.  You may view this file by typing:
	<ARG> # <USE>
Type <USE> again to return to your file.
