		     ERROR MESSAGES

We will take this opportunity to provide additional explanations
on error messages:

1.  "Badkeyerr - editor error"

     Cause:
     Action: Hit another key.

2.  "Argument must be numeric."

     Cause:  You provided a non-numeric argument to a function
	     expecting a number.  For example, typing
		<ARG> j <+LINE>
	     would cause the above error message to be displayed
	     since the number of lines must be an integer.

     Action: Redo the function providing a positive integer as an
	     argument.

3.  "Argument must be positive."
     Cause:  You provided a negative number as an argument to a
	     function expecting a positive number.  For example,
	     typing,
		<ARG> -2 <OPEN>
	     would cause the above error message to be displayed
	     since the number of lines to open must be a positive
	     integer.

     Action: Redo the function providing a positive integer as an
	     argument.

4.  "Nothing in the PICK buffer."
     Cause:  You have pressed <PUT> when no lines have been picked.

     Action: Use <PICK> to identify the lines to <PUT>.

5.  "Can't put a window there."
     Cause:  You have placed the cursor in an unacceptable
	     position for window creation.

     Action: Reposition the cursor correctly (Read <PORT>).

6.  "Nothing to search for."
     Cause:  You have pressed a <+SCH> or a <-SCH> without
	     having specified a string to search for.

     Action: Provide a string as an <ARG> to a <+SCH> or
	     a <-SCH>.

7.  "Search key not found!"
     Cause:  The string you specified as an <ARG> to a <+SCH>
	     (1) does not occur, or (2) all occurrences of the
	     string have already been found between the current
	     cursor position and the end of the file.  For a
	     <-SCH> one of the above conditions exist between
	     the current cursor position and the beginning of
	     of the file.

     Action: No corrective action required.


8.  "Can't make any more ports."
     Cause:  You have tried to create more than 10 windows on
	     the screen.  The maximum number permitted is 10.

     Action: Discontinue window creation.


9.  "You cannot modify this file."
     Cause:  You have attempted to alter a file which is write
	     protected.

     Action: Cease attempts to change the file.


10. "Feature not implemented yet."
     Cause:  You have pressed some combination of keys that
	     the Editor does not recognize.

     Action: Try something else.

11. "Nothing in the CLOSE buffer."
     Cause:  You have pressed <ARG><PUT> when no lines have been
	     closed.

     Action: Use <CLOSE> to remove appropriate lines and repeat
	     the <ARG><PUT>.

12. "Margin stuck; move cursor to free."
     Cause:  You have tried to type past the end of the line in view.

     Action: Move the cursor or move the window (see <RIGHT>).
