			<EXIT>

Pressing
	<EXIT>
causes

	1)  the file(s) you have currently been working on to be
	    saved;
	2)  the previous versions of those files to be moved to
	    backup files named FILENAME.bak;
	3)  removes you from the Editor.

Pressing
	<ARG> <EXIT>
causes an <EXIT> as described above and in addition runs the
compil program starting at the last invoked use of compil,i.e.
either c compilation (c), load (load), or execute (ex).  If no
previous use of compil has occurred, the message
	compil: no args given
appears after the normal exit from the Editor. Use compil giving
the appropriate argument.

Pressing
	<ARG> a <EXIT>
where a is the alpha character "a" takes you out of the Editor
without saving the version of the files you have just been mod-
ifying.  This action is particularly useful when you have made
alterations to a file (1) for demonstration purposes or (2) in
error and, therefore, do not wish to save your changes.

Wylbur Comparison
-----------------

The equivalent to
	<EXIT>
in Wylbur is the command
	SAVE dsname
where dsname is the name of the file and must be given.
The equivalent to
	<ARG> a <EXIT>
in Wylbur is the command
	CLEAR TEXT

Note, however, that these Wylbur commands do not take you out
of Wylbur whereas the Editor's <EXIT> does remove you from the
Editor.
