			<GOTO>

Pressing
	<GOTO>
moves the window to the beginning of the file.  Thus Line 1
of the file will appear at the top of the window.

You may also enter
	<ARG> n <GOTO>
where n equals the number of the line to move to the standard
cursor position (11 lines down from the top) and n is greater
than 11.  Thus, if you

	1)  Press <ARG>
	2)  Enter 20
	3)  Press <GOTO>

the file will readjust such that the 20th line appears at the
standard cursor position followed by the next 26 lines of
text.  If the line containing the cursor is still within the
window, the cursor will reappear under the same character or
blank on that line.  If the line is no longer displayed, the
cursor moves to the standard cursor position.

If you enter a non-integer argument to a <GOTO> the
following message will appear at the bottom left of
the screen:
	**** Argument must be numeric.
Repeat the function providing an integer as an argument.

To go to the end of your file type
	<ARG> <GOTO>

Wylbur Comparison
-----------------

The equivalent to the Editor's
	<GOTO>
in Wylbur is the command
	LIST 1/37
	    or
	LIST 1/LAST PAGE=37
This causes the first 37 lines of your file to be listed.
The equivalent to
	<ARG> n <GOTO>
in Wylbur is the command
	LIST (line.number-10)/(line.number+26)
	    or
	LIST (line.number-10)/LAST PAGE=37
To move to the 20th line with 37 lines displayed, as in the
example above, you type
	LIST 10/46
	    or
	LIST 10/L P=37
