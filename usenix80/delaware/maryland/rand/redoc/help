			<HELP>

To read through, to review and to exit from this and all
other help explanations, you will need to use the <+PAGE>,
<-PAGE>, and <HELP> keys respectively.

To use the help feature in the Editor you press <HELP>.  You
will then see the message 'Press desired key for help.' appear
at the bottom left of your screen.  After pressing any one
of the keys on the keyboard one of the following will occur:

	1)  A description of the key you pressed will be
	    displayed on the screen.  When you have finished
	    reading the explanation you press <HELP> to
	    return to your file.  Note: there is a limit on the
	    number of descriptions you can use in each edit session.
	    If the message "**** Too many files -- Editor limit!"
	    appears on the screen, exit, and start over.

	2)  The message 'Standard keyboard character.' will
	    appear at the bottom left of the screen.
	    You have pressed a key that performs no other
	    function.  You remain in your file as no further
	    explanation is necessary.

Although keys <e>,<w>, and <k> are standard keyboard characters
and perform in the Editor as such,  when either is combined
with <HELP> additional information is provided:

	<HELP> <e>        Explanation of error messages.
	<HELP> <w>        Description of screen (window)
			  characteristics.
	<HELP> <k>        Keyboard layout.

The <HELP> key itself also performs another function when used
with <INSERT>.  Press <HELP> <INSERT> for more information.

		THE RAND TEXT EDITOR: AN OVERVIEW
		---------------------------------

WHAT?     A program that permits you to create and modify text.

HOW?      By allowing you to insert, move and delete characters,
	  words, lines, pages, etc.

BUT HOW?  By permitting you to:
    ---         1)  move the cursor to the specific location for
		    the modification;
		2)  perform the function by pressing a key identified
		    with that function.

LIKE WYLBUR?
	  No, not like Wylbur.  To perform editing functions in
	  Wylbur you must learn a command language and you must
	  identify the location for modification by line number.

There are two versions of the Rand Text Editor:

	1) re  - for the user already familiar with the Editor;
	2) lre - for the novice; provides helpful information
		 on Editor functions.

To use the Rand Text Editor you type one of the following sequences:

(1)  re
     lre

     If you have previously edited a file, the last file
     referenced by re or lre will be displayed with the
     cursor reappearing in the location in which it was left.
     If you have not previously edited a file with re or lre,
     the file /re.std, a system file containing information
     on the Editor, will be displayed.  Note that you cannot
     modify /re.std.

(2)  re FILENAME
     lre FILENAME

     If FILENAME exists, the first page of the file will be
     displayed.  If it does not, the message
	Hit <USE> to make: FILENAME
     will appear at the lower left of the screen.  Taking this
     action creates a new file with the first, empty page displayed.

(3)  re +FILENAME
     lre +FILENAME

     This causes the first page of FILENAME to be displayed AND
     sets up the last file viewed as the alternate file to be
     displayed by a <USE>.  If no file has previously been viewed
     the system file /re.std remains the alternate.

(4)  re !FILENAME
     lre !FILENAME

     This restores you to the state in which FILENAME was left,
     i.e. with all windows and the last page viewed displayed.

The best way to learn how to use the Editor is enter the lre
version, try various keys and when their function is not clear
press <HELP> and then the specific key.  Good luck!
