			<INSERT>

Pressing
	<INSERT>
puts you into "insert mode" where you may then:

	1)  Insert any alphanumeric character, causing the
	    characters to the right of the cursor and
	    including the character at the current cursor
	    position to be pushed over to the right.  Char-
	    acters are not overwritten.  In the example below
	    the word 'not' has been inserted and the word
	    'black' pushed over.

		The horse is black.
			    -
		The horse is  black.
			     -
		The horse is n black.
			      -
		The horse is no black.
			       -
		The horse is not black.
				-
	    Pressing the spacebar will insert blanks.

	2)  Press MR <GOBBLE> which will delete characters
	    to the left while pulling the characters to the
	    right back. That is, to eliminate 'not' in the
	    above example you would position the cursor after
	    'not' and press <GOBBLE> 4 times as shown below:

		The horse is not black.
				-
		The horse is no black.
			       -
		The horse is n black.
			      -
		The horse is  black.
			     -
		The horse is black.
			    -

	3)  Press <SUCK> (CNTR-u key) which causes the
	    cursor to remain stationary while pulling characters
	    from the right towards the cursor and deleting them
	    one by one.  In the above example instead of
	    placing the cursor after 'not' and backspacing to
	    remove it you could position the cursor before
	    'not' and <SUCK> it away as shown below.

		The horse is not black.
			    -
		The horse isnot black.
			    -
		The horse isot black.
			    -
		The horse ist black.
			    -
		The horse is black.

	4)  Press any other Editor function key while remaining in
	    insert mode.
