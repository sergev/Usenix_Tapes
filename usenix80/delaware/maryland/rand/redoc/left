			<LEFT>

Pressing
	<LEFT>
moves the window left 16 columns if there are more than 16
columns between column position b marking the left boundary
of the window and column 1 of the file (a):

		 a               b
		 l               l
		*************************
		*FILE
		*
		*               ---------
		*               <WINDOW
		* <-  <-  <-  <-<
		*               <
		*               <

In this case the symbol < will appear as the left boundary of
window indicating that the window has not reached the left
boundary of the file.  If 16 columns or less remain between
the left boundary of the window and the file, the window is
moved to the file left boundary.  The left boundary symbol
for the window changes from < to | indicating that the file
and window left boundaries are now the same.

Pressing
	<ARG> n <LEFT>
allows you to move n columns instead of the default 16 for
one move.

If you enter a non-integer argument to a <LEFT> the
following message will appear at the bottom left of
the screen:
	*h** Argument must be numeric.

Repeat the function providing an integer as an argument.
