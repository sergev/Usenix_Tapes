			<+LINE>
		       control-t

Pressing
	<+LINE>
moves to the top of the window the line that is approximatelu
1/3 of a window forward in the file.Thus, if Line 1 is currently
at the top of a 37-line (the default) window and you press <+LINE>
once, Line 11 will be moved to the top.

You may also enter
	<ARG> n <+LINE>
where n is the number of lines you wish the window to move down.
For example, if
	1)  Line 22 is the first line in a 37-line window;
	2)  You press <ARG>;
	3)  You enter <+LINE>
the window will readjust forward wuch that line 27 now appears at
the top of the file followed in sequence by the next 36 lines
of text.  If the line containing the cursor is still within
the window, the cursor will reappear under the same character
or blank on that line.  If the line is no longer displayed,
the cursor moves to the standard cursor position approximately
1/4 of a window down from the top.

If you enter a non-integer argument to a <+LINE> the
following message will appear at the bottom left of
the screen:
	**** Argument must be numeric.
Repeat the function providing an integer as an argument.

To move the line where the cursor is currently positioned
to the top of the window type
	<ARG> <+LINE>

Wylbur Comparison
-----------------

A similar command to
	<+LINE>
in Wylbur is the command
	LIST PAGE=10 <CR.....>
With each press of the carriage return <CR> the next 10th line
in your file becomes the top line followed by the next 9 lines
in sequence.  The Editor displays the following 36 lines of text.

The equivalent to
	<ARG> n <+LINE>
in Wylbur is the command
	LIST PAGE=n <CR.....>
where n is the number of lines to move down.
Note that in the Editor you may edit between presses of <+LINE>.
In Wylbur, however, if you issue an edit command after a LIST
you may not continue listing by simply pressing <CR> but must
retype the LIST command.
