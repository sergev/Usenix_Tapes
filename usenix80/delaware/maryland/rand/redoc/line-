			<-LINE>

Pressing
	<-LINE>
moves to the top of the window the line that is approximately
1/3 of a window back in the file.  Thus, if Line 25 is currently
at the top of a 37-line window (the default) and you press
<-LINE> once, Line 15 will be moved to the top.

You may also enter
	<ARG> n <-LINE>
where n is the number of lines you wish the window to move up.
If, for example,
	1)  Line 22 is the first line in the window;
	2)  You press <ARG>;
	3)  You enter 5;
	4)  You press <-LINE>
the window will readjust backward wuch that line 17 now appears at
the top of the file followed in sequence by the next 36 lines
of text.  If the line containing the cursor is still within
the window, the cursor will reappear under the same character
or blank on that line.  If the line is no longer displayed,
the cursor moves to the standard cursor position approximately
1/4 of a window down from the top.

If you enter a non-integer argument to a <-LINE> the
following message will appear at the bottom left of
the screen:
	**** Argument must be numeric.
Repeat the function providing an integer as an argument.

To move the line where the cursor is currently positioned
to the bottom of the window type
	<ARG> <-LINE>

Wylbur Comparison
-----------------

Wylbur does not have a command that moves lines back n lines.
You must move to a specific line by using the LIST command.  LIST
is similar to the Rand Editor key <GOTO>.
