			<OPEN>

The <OPEN> function permits you to open up lines, columns
and areas defined by lines and columns.

Lines
-----

Inserting blank lines may be accomplished by:
(1)  Pressing
	<OPEN>
which moves down 1 line all text starting with the line on which
the cursor is currently located.  The current line becomes blank.
The cursor remains in the same position. For example, if you had
typed:

	------------
	|horse
	|cow_
	|
	|

then decided you wanted the text double spaced instead of single
spaced, you press <OPEN> to insert the blank line between horse
and cow:

	-----------
	|horse
	|   _
	|cow
	|
Note the position of the cursor.

(2)  Typing
	<ARG> n <OPEN>
where n equals the number of blank lines to insert.  If you
	1)  Press <ARG>
	2)  Type 5
	3)  Press <OPEN>
you will insert 5 blank lines at the current cursor position.

If you enter a non-integer argument to an <OPEN> the
following message will appear at the bottom left of
the screen:
	**** Argument must be numeric.
Repeat the function providing an integer as an argument.

If you enter a negative integer as an argument to an <OPEN>
the following message will appear:
	**** Argument must be positive.
Repeat the function providing a positive integer as an argument.

(3)  Typing
	<beg.pos> <ARG> <end.pos> <OPEN>
where <beg.pos> is defined by the current cursor position and
the <end.pos> is indicated by moving the cursor using the cursor
motion buttons.  The <end.pos> of the cursor MUST be in the same
column, different line as the <beg.pos>; otherwise and area is
opened up (see below) rather than just lines.

Partial lines, delimited on the left by the current cursor position
(<beg.pos>) and on the right by the end of the line, may be moved
to the following line left margin by typing:
	<beg.pos> <ARG> <OPEN>
For example, by placing the cursor under the 'r' in ran, below,

	----------------------
	|and the dish ran away
	|with the spoon.
	|

and typing <ARG> <OPEN>, the following appears:

	----------------------
	|and the dish
	|ran away
	|with the spoon.

Columns
-------

To insert blank columns on a line type:
	<beg.pos> <ARG> <end.pos> <OPEN>
where <beg.pos> is defined by the current cursor position and
the <end.pos> is indicated by moving the cursor using the cursor
motion buttons, <TAB> or <horizontal arrows>.  The <end.pos> of the
cursor MUST be on the same line, different column as the <beg.pos>;
otherwise an area is opened up (see below) rather than just columns.

Blank columns may also be inserted by using the <INSERT> <spacebar>
function (see INSERT).

Areas
-----

To open up an area, type:
	<beg.pos> <ARG> <end.pos> <OPEN>
where <beg.pos> is defined by the current cursor position and
the <end.pos> is indicated by moving the cursor using any of the
cursor motion buttons, <TAB>,<BACKTAB>, <horizontal/vertical arrows>.
and <CR>.  The <end.pos> of the cursor MUST be in a different column
and on a different line than the <beg.pos>; otherwise either lines
OR columns are opened up rather than an area.

Wylbur Comparison
-----------------

The command most frequently used in Wylbur to add lines is
	COLLECT line-number
where line-number is the line-number at which to begin adding.
The Wylbur command INSERT may also be used.

To add blank columns in Wylbur the command
	CHANGE col to 'string of blanks' in line-no.
is used.

To create a blank area of columns and lines in Wylbur the command
	CHANGE col to 'string of blanks' in range
is used where range = beginning line no./ending line-no.
