			<+PAGE>

Pressing
	<+PAGE>
moves the window  starting from the line currently at the
top of the screen down 1 page where a page equals the number
of lines showing in the window.  A full-screen window is 37
lines.  If more than one window appears on the screen a page
may equal less than 37 lines.

You may also enter
	<ARG> n <+PAGE>
where n is the number of pages forward you wish the window to
move.  For example, if
	1)  Line 10 is the first line in the window
	2)  You press <ARG>
	3)  You enter 2
	4)  You press <+PAGE>
the window will readjust down such that line 84 (2x37+10) now
appears at the top of the file.  The cursor moves to the standard
cursor position 11 lines down from the top of the window.

If you enter a non-integer argument to a <+PAGE> the
following message will appear at the bottom left of
the screen:
	**** Argument must be numeric.
Repeat the function providing an integer as an argument.

Wylbur Comparison
-----------------

A similar command to
	<+PAGE>
is Wylbur's
	LIST PAGE=37 <CR....>
With each press of the <CR> the next 37 lines of the file are
displayed.

In the Editor you may edit in between "paging".  However, in
Wylbur if you issue an edit command after a LIST you may not
continue paging by simply pressing <CR> but must retype the
LIST command.
