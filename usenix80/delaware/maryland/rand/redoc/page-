			<-PAGE>

Pressing
	<-PAGE>
moves the window up 1 page where a page equals the number
of lines showing in the window.  A full-screen window is 37
lines.  If more than one window appears on the screen a page
may equal less than 37 lines.

You may also enter
	<ARG> n <-PAGE>
where n is the number of pages back you wish the window to
move.  For example, if
	1)  Line 84 is the first line in the window
	2)  You press <ARG>
	3)  You enter 2
	4)  You press <-PAGE>
the window will readjust upwards such that line 10 (84-2x37) now
appears at the top of the file.  The cursor moves to the standard
cursor position 11 lines down from the top of the window.

If you enter a non-integer argument to a <-PAGE> the
following message will appear at the bottom left of
the screen:
	**** Argument must be numeric.
Repeat the function providing an integer as an argument.

Wylbur Comparison
-----------------

Wylbur does not include a page concept.  You must specify
a particular range of lines by using the LIST command.  LIST
is similar to the Rand Editor key <GOTO>.
