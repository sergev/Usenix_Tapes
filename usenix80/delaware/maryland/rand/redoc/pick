			<PICK>

<PICK> is used in combination with the <PUT> function to copy
one or more lines from one location to another.  Lines picked
remain in a buffer until another <PICK> occurs; thus multiple
copies of the picked lines may be generated by repeated <PUT>'s.
All text PICKed and CLOSEd during the current editing session
is saved in a special file named '#'.  You may view this file
by typing:
	<ARG> # <USE>
Type <USE> again to return to your file.

Lines may be picked in 3 ways:

(1)  Pressing
	<PICK>
thus causing the line at which the cursor is currently located to
be saved in a buffer.

(2) Typing
	<ARG> n <PICK>
where n equals the number of lines to save in the buffer.  For
example, if you
	1)  Press <ARG>
	2)  Enter 5
	3)  Press <PICK>
5 lines beginning with the line at which the cursor is located
will be saved.

If you enter a non-integer argument to a <PICK> the
following message will appear at the bottom left of
the screen:
	**** Argument must be numeric.
Repeat the function providing an integer as an argument.
To copy a line from one file to another you type:
       <PICK> <ARG> [FILENAME] <USE> [position cursor] <PUT>
For example, if you are in File X and wish to copy the line
at which the cursor is located into File Y, you
	1)  Press <PICK>.
	2)  Press <ARG>.
	3)  Type Y.
	4)  Press <USE>.
	5)  You are now in File Y; page, line, arrow, tab, etc.
	    to position the cursor where you wish to insert the
	    line from File X.
	7)  Press <PUT>.
You may remain in File Y or you may return to File X by typing:
	<USE>

(3)  Typing
	<beg.pos> <ARG> <end.pos> <PICK>
where <beg.pos> is defined by the current cursor position and
the <end.pos> is indicated by moving the cursor using the
cursor motion buttons. If the <beg.pos> and <end.pos> fo the
cursor are:
	(a)  On different lines, same columns, lines are picked.
	(b)  On the same line, different columns, columns are picked.
	(c)  On different lines, different columns, areas are picked.
Thus, using the cursor motion buttons, you may now pick columns,
areas and partial lines.

Wylbur Comparison
-----------------

A similar command in Wylbur to the pick/put function is the
	COPY line-number/line-number TO line-number
where "line-number/line-number" specifies the range of lines
to be moved.  In the Rand Editor, however, you give the number
of lines to pick, not the range.  Also you may delay in
re-inserting the lines whereas in Wylbur the action is completed
with the one command.
