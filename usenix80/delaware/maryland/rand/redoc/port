			<PORT>

Pressing
	<PORT>
creates another window on the screen.  This feature is use-
ful when comparing text from different sections; viewing main
and subroutine modules; etc.  Note that to create another
window the cursor must either be in:
	1)  Col=1, Line=2-36; creates a horizontal window.
     or 2)  Line=1, Col=2-77; creates a vertical window.
If a window cannot be created the following message appears
at the bottom left of the screen:
	**** Can't put a window there.
In this case just reposition the cursor correctly.

The maximum number of windows you may have on the screen is
ten.  If you try to create more, the following message appears
at the bottom left of the screen:
	**** Can't make any more ports.

If no FILENAME is given, the new window will view the system
file /re.std.

Most likely you will want to specify a FILENAME:
	<ARG> FILENAME <PORT>
This will display FILENAME in the new window if it already
exists.  If it does not, the message
	Hit <USE> to make: FILENAME
will appear at the lower left of the screen.  Taking this
action creates a new empty file viewed by the new window.

You may have more than one window viewing the same file.
Any changes to the file via one window will also appear
in the others if they are viewing the same section of the file.
To switch from one window to another press
	<CH-P>
where CH-P is a <CTRL-c). If only one window exists on the
screen then <CH-P> does nothing.

Wylbur Comparison
-----------------

There is no equivalent to <PORT> in Wylbur other than to
SAVE one file and then USE another while some of the text
from the first file still appears on the screen.  You may
switch to another file in Wylbur, not in the <PORT> sense,
but in the manner of the Editor's USE function.   Type
	<HELP> <USE>
for an explanation.
