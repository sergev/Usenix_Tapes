			<PUT>=control-g=bell

Pressing
	<PUT>
inserts at the current location of the cursor the last line(s)
that were "picked".  All lines starting with the line on which
the cursor is located are moved down to make room for the new
lines.  Multiple copies of picked lines may be generated by
repeated <PUT>'s.

The capability to <PUT> partial lines is partially implemented
as of July 4, l975, that is to say a bug exists.  A series of
blanks the length of the partial line is inserted when the
first <PUT> is executed. Subsequent <PUT>s of the same partial
line inserts the text correctly.

You may delete lines (see <CLOSE>) and then re-insert them
or recover them in case of error. Typing
	<ARG> <PUT>
will put back in the file the line(s) last deleted by a <CLOSE>.

If no lines have been deleted the message
	***Nothing in the CLOSE buffer.
appears at the lower left of the screen.

To copy a line from one file to another you type:
	<PICK> <ARG> [FILENAME] <USE> [position cursor] <PUT>

For example, if you are in File X and wish to copy the line
at which the cursor is located into File Y, you
	1)  Press <PICK>.
	2)  Press <ARG>.
	3)  Type Y.
	4)  Press <USE>.
	5)  You are now in File Y; page, line, arrow, tab, etc.
	    to position the cursor where you wish to insert the
	    line from File X.
	6)  Press <PUT>.
You may remain in File Y or you may return to File X by typing:
	<USE>

Wylbur Comparison
-----------------

A similar command in Wylbur to the pick/put function is the
	COPY line-number/line-number TO line-number
where "line-number/line-number" specifies the range of lines
to be moved.  In the Rand Editor, however, you give the number
of lines to pick, not the range.

A similar command in Wylbur to
	<CLOSE> <ARG> <PUT>
which deletes lines as they are moved is the command
	MOVE line-number/line-number TO line-number
where "line-number/line-number" specifies the range of lines
to move.
