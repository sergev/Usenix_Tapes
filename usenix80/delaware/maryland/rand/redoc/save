		<SAVE> = <CTRL-v>

Pressing
	<SAVE>
causes the file being edited to be saved, an action that should
be taken periodically during an editing session to insure againt
system failures. The message
	SAVE: current-FILENAME
is flashed at the lower left of the screen.

You may also use this function to save the current file under
another name by typing
	<ARG> new-FILENAME <SAVE>
The original version is thus still available under the current
FILENAME and the current version is saved under the new FILENAME.

CAUTION:  When you <EXIT>, the current version with all modifi-
cations will replace the original and not the newly created file
If you want it saved in the latter, type again
	<ARG> new-FILENAME <SAVE>
and then
	<ARG> a <EXIT>
