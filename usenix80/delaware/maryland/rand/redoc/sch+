			<+SCH>
Pressing
	<+SCH>
causes a search down the file from the current cursor position
for the next occurrence of the string most recently specified
as an argument to a search, either <+SCH> or <-SCH>.  If no
string has been specified a message
	**** Nothing to search for.
appears at the bottom left of the window.

To enter a string and to search for it then, you type
	<ARG> string <SCH+>....
That is,
	1)  Press <ARG>;
	2)  Enter the string to search for;
	3)  Press <+SCH> once to find the first occurrence
	    of the string; press <+SCH> again to find the
	    second occurrence; etc...
If no occurrence of the string is found or if all occurrences
have already been found and no more exist in the direction
indicated, the following message
	**** Search key not found!
appears at the bottom left of the screen.

Wylbur Comparison
-----------------

The equivalent to the Editor's
	<ARG> string <+SCH>...
in Wylbur is the command
	MODIFY "string" PAGE=1 <CR>...
With each press of the carriage return the next occurrence
of the string is listed.  You may modify the specific string
located, as in the Editor, and then press <CR> to find the
next occurrence of the originally defined string.
