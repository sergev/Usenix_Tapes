			<-SCH>=control-e

Pressing
	<-SCH>
causes a search up the file from the current cursor position
for the next occurrence of the string most recently specified
as an argument to a search, either <+SCH> or <-SCH>.  If no
string has been specified a message
	**** Nothing to search for.
appears at the bottom left of the window.

To enter a string and to search for it then, you type
	<ARG> string <-SCH>...
That is,
	1)  Press <ARG>;
	2)  Enter the string to search for;
	3)  Press <-SCH> once to find the last occurrence
	    of the string; press <-SCH> again to find the
	    second occurrence; etc.
If no occurrence of the string is found or if all ocurrences
have already been found and no more exist in the direction
indicated, the following message
	**** Search key not found!
appears at the bottom left of the screen.
