			  <TAB>

Pressing
	<TAB>
moves the cursor to the next nearest tabstop.  Initially,
tabstops are set to col. 9,17,25,33,41,49,57,65, and 73.
For example, with the columns of the window numbered
1-78, the cursor initially in col. 1, pressing <TAB>
once will cause the cursor to move to col. 9.  If the
cursor is in col. 24, <TAB> moves it to col. 25.

For information on resetting and clearing tabs see <CH-T>.
