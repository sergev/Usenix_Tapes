			<USE>

Pressing
	<ARG> FILENAME <USE>
causes, if FILENAME exists, the current file to become the
alternate file and FILENAME to become the current file.

If FILENAME does not exist you will see the message
	HIT <USE> to make: FILENAME
appear at the lower left of the screen.  Taking this action
creates a new empty file which becomes the current file and
the current file then becomes the alternate file.

You may switch between the current and alternate files by
pressing <USE>. If no alternate file has been specified,
the system file /re.std is used.

Wylbur Comparison
-----------------

The nearest equivalent to the Editor's <USE> in Wylbur is to
combine the commands USE and SAVE  on alternate files.
