			  <w>

You have pressed a standard keyboard character which performs
as such in the Editor.


			 WINDOW

Your file will be displayed in a window through which you
view and manipulate the text.  The standard window displays
text 37 lines by 78 columns.  To view additional text
the functions <+PAGE>, <-PAGE>, <+LINE>, <-LINE> and others
are available.  More than one window may appear on the screen
in which case the windows may contain less than 37 lines and/or
less than 78 columns.  Read the section on <PORT> for information
on creating multiple windows.
The window is delimited by dashed lines on the top,
bottom, and right sides.  The left boundary may consist of
semicolons which mark the beginning of the remaining
empty lines in the file.  Thus, when entering a new file
the left boundary will consist entirely of semicolons. How-
ever, should you enter, for example, text on Lines 1 and 2,
write the file, and then retrieve the file for editing again
you will note that Lines 1 and 2 are now preceded by dashes while
the remaining  empty lines are preceded by semicolons.

Also displayed in the window along the boundaries are position
markers that identify the current line and column position
of the cursor.  When entering a file, the cursor appears at the
standard cursor position approximately 1/4 of a window down
from the top at the left boundary.  The position markers appear
on the left and right ends of that line and the top and bottom
of Column 1.  If you return to the last file edited by omitting
the FILENAME when entering the Editor, the cursor will reappear
at its last location in the file.
