.th EMPTY II 19-June-1979
.sh NAME
empty \*- check whether a file is empty
.sh SYNOPSIS
(empty=63.; not in assembler)
.br
(file descriptor in r0)
.br
sys empty
.br
(result in r0)
.sp 1
int fildes;
.br
empty(fildes);
.sh DESCRIPTION
Given a (read) file descriptor,
.it empty
checks to see whether there are any characters to be read from
the file.  More precisely, it checks to see whether a read on
that descriptor would cause the calling process to be put
to sleep.
.it Empty
returns 1 if a read on fildes would hang, 0 otherwise.
.s1
Since the empty predicate is meaningful only for pipes
and certain character devices, (such as ttys)
.it empty
will always
return 0 if the descriptor is for a block special file, standard file,
or directory.
.s1
A read on an empty pipe with one end closed, or a tty on which
an EOF has been typed, returns
EOF rather than going to sleep.
Empty returns 0 in this case.
.sh "SEE ALSO"
pipe(II), dup(II), close(II), read(II)
.sh DIAGNOSTICS
The error bit (c-bit) is set for an unknown file descriptor or a descriptor
which couldn't be read from.
From c a -1 indicates an error.

.sh BUGS
The character device drivers must be changed for
.it empty
to work correctly with them.
