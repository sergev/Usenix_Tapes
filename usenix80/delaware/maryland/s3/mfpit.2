.sh NAME
mfpit \*- move from previous instruction space trap

.sh DESCRIPTION
.it Mfpit
returns in r0 the
.it contents
of the instruction word given by
.it addr
in r0.
Although processes in
.bd USER
mode can write into their own writable
\fBI\*-\fRspace
areas using the
.it mtpi
(move to previous
\fBI\*-\fRspace)
instruction in separated mode,
the
.it mfpi
(move from previous
\fBI\*-\fRspace)
instruction diverts
\fBUSER\fR\*-mode
\fBI\*-\fRspace
into
\fBD\*-\fRspace
accesses.
The diversion is an attempt to provide execute-only code.
However, code areas do not need to be protected from
reading themselves.
On the contrary, the
.it mfpit
call provides a needed way to access any
USER mode
\fBI\*-\fRspace
word.
.s3
.it Mfpit
provides a potentional fix for
.it fptrap,
the floating point hardware simulator,
which allow floating point instructions
to be examined in separated mode.
.sh "SEE ALSO"
obreak (II), exec (II), lisp (VI), fptrap (III)
.sh DIAGNOSTICS
If
.it addr
is odd or an unallocated
\fBI\*-\fRspace
location,
.it mfpit
returns \*-1, 177777 (octal).
However, the c, error bit is never set on return.
.sh BUGS
The UNIX operating system must be reconfigured before using
.it mfpit.
.br
In order to speed processing,
no error return is used other than returning \*-1,
177777 (octal),
which is
an unlikely instruction or operand.
