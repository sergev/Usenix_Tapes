.sh NAME
readnl \*- read until new line character
.sh SYNOPSIS
(readnl = 59.; not in assembler)
.br
(file descriptor in r0)
.ft B

sys readnl; buffer; nbytes

.s3
readnl(fildes, buffer, nbytes)

char *buffer;
.ft R
.sh DESCRIPTION
A file descriptor is a word
returned from a successful
.it "open, creat, dup,"
or
.it pipe
call.
.it Buffer
is the location of
.it nbytes
contiguous
bytes into which the input may be placed.
From files within file structures,
pipes, and terminals, input
.it nbytes
bytes are transfered to
.it buffer
unless a new-line character
(012 octal)
is transfered.
No further bytes are transfered beyond an input new-line character.
Essentially, the rest of the current line of
.bd ASCII
characters is transfered,
provided sufficient buffer space is allocated.
Input from raw character devices is specific to each device.
Characters are transfered from raw character devices
ignoring the new-line character.
In any event the number of characters read is returned
(in r0).
.s3
If the returned value is 0, then
end-of-file has been reached.
.sh "SEE ALSO"
open (II), creat (II), dup (II), pipe (II), read (II)
.sh DIAGNOSTICS
As mentioned,
0 is returned when the end of the file has been reached.
If the read was otherwise unsuccessful
the error bit (c-bit) is set.
Many conditions
can generate an error:
physical I/O errors, bad buffer address,
preposterous
.it nbytes,
file descriptor not that of
an input file.
From C, a \*-1 return indicates the error.
.sh BUGS
The UNIX operating system must be reconfigured to include
.it readnl
before use.
.br
Raw character devices,
such as raw-mode magtape,
do not check for the new-line character.
