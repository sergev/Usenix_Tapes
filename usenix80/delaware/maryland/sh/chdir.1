becomes the new working directory.
The process must have execute (search)
permission in
.it directory.
.s3
If the directory name is omitted, the initial login directory for the
user is changed to.

Because a new process is created to execute each command,
.it chdir
would be ineffective if it were written as a
normal command.  It is therefore recognized and executed
by the Shell.
