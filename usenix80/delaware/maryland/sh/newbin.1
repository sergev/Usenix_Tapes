.th NEWBIN I 11/9/76
.sh NAME
newbin \*- update private bin directory
.sh SYNOPSIS
.bd newbin
.sh DESCRIPTION
To speed things up, the shell keeps a hash table of the names of
commands in the user's private `bin' directory.
If this directory is changed, the
.it newbin
command updates these tables.
.s3
The usual effect of forgetting to give the
.it newbin
is that the new command can not be found.
.sh "SEE ALSO"
sh (I)
.sh BUGS
Really this command should not be needed.
On the other hand, maybe we should hash /bin and /usr/bin.
