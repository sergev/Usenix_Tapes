.sh NAME
next \*- execute a command file
.sh SYNPOSIS
.bd next
file
.sh DESCRIPTION
.it Next
makes the shell read the given file.
This is similar to
.it sh
except that the top level shell reads the file directly.
This is mostly so that 
.it set
and
.it chdir
commands will continue to be effective in the current session.
.s3
When the shell starts, if it thinks that it is a top level shell then
it fakes a
.in +5
next .profile
.i0
so that you can initialize shell variables and such.
.s3
This command is executed directly by the shell.
.sh "SEE ALSO"
sh (I)
