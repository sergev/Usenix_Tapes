.sh NAME
dog \*- paged cat and command executer
.sh SYNOPSIS
dog [-pgsize] [-t] command [arguments]
.br
dog [-pgsize] [-t] file ...
.br
dog [-pgsize] [-t]
.sh DESCRIPTION
.it Dog
executes the specified command,
pausing after every pgsize lines
of standard output have been filled.
It will wait for a newline to be entered from the terminal before
continuing.
.s3
If the command is invalid,
then all of the arguments
are assumed to be files that are meant
to be 'cat'ed to the terminal.
Thus, dog can be used instead of cat.
.s3
If no files are specified, dog reads
from standard input;
it can therefore be used as a filter.
.s3
Default is pgsize=24.
.s3
The -t option causes dog to clear the screen before continuing.
This is intended to be used for the Tektronix 4013 which cannot
scroll.
.sh AUTHOR
Written by Steve Eisen of CUNY/UCC.
Inspired by the program published in the June, 1977 edition of
.it "UNIX News".
.s1
T option added and internal changes made by Fred Blonder.
.sh BUGS
Does not check user bin files when used with the Yale shell.
Shell command files in /bin or /usr/bin are not found.
The filter form must be used in these cases.
.s1
Shell command files in the current directory are cat'ed rather
than being executed.
