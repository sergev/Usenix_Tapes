.th EDINODE VIII 6-May-80
.sh NAME
edinode - tweak fields in inodes
.sh SYNOPSIS
edinode <inumber> <file system>
.sh DESCRIPTION
.bd "    Edinode"
allows you to directly modify the fields within an inode.
Since this is done outside of the standard Unix
internal file management, it may be used to correct errors
that Unix can't cope with by itself.
When you invoke
.bd edinode
you will be presented with a display that looks something
like this:
.sp 2
.nf
.na
		1)          mode: 0755
		2)         links: 1
		3)          user: 32
		4)         group: 8
		5)          size: 8224
		7)        access: Fri Jan 30 04:15:12 1987
		8)  modification: Wed Nov  9 02:04:05 1994
.sp 2
.fi
.ad
.ti +4
To modify a field, type the field number followed by the desired value
on a single line. E.g.: to set the link count to 3, type:
.sp 1
.ce
2\ 3<cr>
.sp 1
The modified field will be redisplayed. To see the entire inode displayed
again, type a carriage return. To exit and make your changes permanent, type an
end-of-file (ctrl-``D''). You may abort at any time by hitting ``rubout'';
the file system will remain unchanged.
.sh FILES
/dev/r* - raw file system to be patched
.sh "SEE ALSO"
CLRI(VIII), ICHECK(VIII), DCHECK(VIII), MOUNT(VIII), UMOUNT(VIII)
.sh DIAGNOSTICS
.ti +4
Self explanatory. Mostly read or write errors resulting from
lack of permission to molest the file system.
.sh BUGS
.ti +4
The file system being patched should be unmounted while surgery
is preformed.
.bd Edinode
has no way of verifying that this is the case.
.sp 1
.ti +4
Currently, only the first four fields may be altered.
