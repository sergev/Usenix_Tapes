.th ENABLE I 8-May-80
.sh NAME
.bd enable
- start a ``getty'' process on a teletype port
.sh SYNOPSIS
.bd enable
<ttyno> [ <flag-character> ]
.sh DESCRIPTION
.bd "    Enable"
starts a
.bd getty
process on a teletype line, allowing
it to be used to log in from. The line is indicated by giving the last
character of the teletype name as the first argument.
.bd Enable
works by editing the file: ``/etc/ttys'', and then signaling the
.bd init
process to examine the file.
The optional single-character second argument will -- if given -- be written
into the ``/etc/ttys'' file to be passed to
.bd getty
as an argument. This is intended to allow the line to be configured for a
particular type of terminal.
.bd Enable
will
.ul
not
create a new tty entry, nor delete an old one from the file.
