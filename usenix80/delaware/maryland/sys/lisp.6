.th LISP VI 28-November-1979
.sh NAME
lisp \*- list processing language interpreter
.sh SYNOPSIS
.bd lisp
[ file . . . ] [
.bd +
] [
.bd \*-
]
.sh DESCRIPTION
The
.it lisp
interpreter applies the function
LOAD
to each
.it file
parameter.
Each
.it file
consists of a sequence of LISP S-expressions
that the interpreter reads and evaluates.
LOAD discards the values.
Often LOAD simply creates bindings
to be used during an interactive session.
These S-expressions may be
intermixed with compiled LISP functions.
.it Lisp
ignores unknown 
.it file
parameters.
.s3
If
.it lisp
gets a
.bd +
parameter,
.it lisp
outputs a sign-on message and
uses the supervisor function LISP
to interact with the user.
The prompt
.lp +5 0
.s3
Eval:
.s3
.i0
requests the user to provide an S-expression
on the standard input to be read and evaluated.
On the standard output
.lp +5 0
.s3
Value:
.s3
.i0
prefixes the value of the expression.
The current computation may be interrupted with 
the asynchronous interrupt (ASCII DEL)
but not with the QUIT interrupt,
which terminates the interpreter.
.s3
Calling
.it lisp
with no parameters is equivalent to using
.lp +5 0
.s3
.bd lisp
.bd +
.i0
.s3
If
.it lisp
gets the \*- parameter,
the supervisor function LISP
reads expressions from the standard input and
outputs the results of evaluation on the standard output;
however,
.it lisp
suppresses output of the sign-on message,
the input prompt,
and the value prefix.
Thus
.it lisp
may be used as a filter.
When no + parameter is given,
the statuses of signals are uneffected so that
.it lisp
may be invoked as a background process.

.sh DIAGNOSTICS
Using the diagnostic output file,
.it lisp
outputs diagnostic messages of the form
.s3
.lp +5 0
WARNING,
.it expression
.it MESSAGE.
.br
.i0
.s3
The
.it expression
indicates which LISP
S-expression caused the error described by
.it MESSAGE.
The warning may be followed by the prompt
.s3
.lp +5 0
Help:
.br
.i0
.s3
which requests a replacement expression to be read and evaluated.
During start-up
.it file
loading,
.it lisp
only outputs the warning
``error return not found''.
After a storage allocation failure,
.it lisp
outputs ``NO SPACE'' and
after excessive recursion or memory faults,
.it lisp
outputs ``STACK OVERFLOW''.
After sending either message,
.it lisp
resets the stacks and
attempts to invoke the supervisor function LISP.

.sh BUGS
In order to read floating-point numbers,
the user must load a readmacro for ``%'',
included with the pretty printer,
and must preceed floating-point numbers with ``%''.
.s3
The output column width may need to be altered by the function,
PP-SHORT,
included with the pretty printer so that
output will not exceed the output device width.
.s3
More diagnostic information is needed during start-up loading.
.s3
The UNIX operating system must be extended before compiled code
is supported and another extension is needed
to speed S-expression input.
.s3
On PDP-11/40s,
.it lisp
supports only a small data base,
no compiled code,
and no transendental functions.
