.sh NAME
pstat \*- find if the printer is online
.sh SYNOPSIS
pstat [ - ]
.sh DESCRIPTION
.bd "    Pstat"
tells you whether the Printronix printer is connected online to Unix.
This is convenient if you want to send output directly, but don't
want to run into the next room to be sure that the printer is
ready.
.bd Pstat
also returns status 0 (yes) or 1 (no) so that it can be used by
the
.bd ``if''
command. The optional ``-'' argument may suppress the written
message when
.bd pstat
is used for this purpose.
.sh FILES
/dev/xml0 - to see if it can be opened
.sh "SEE ALSO"
IF(I)
.sh DIAGNOSTICS
None are necessary because no errors can occur.
.sh BUGS
Absolutely none.
