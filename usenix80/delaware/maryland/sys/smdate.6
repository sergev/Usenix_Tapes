.sh SYNOPSIS
.bd smdate
mmddhhmm[yy] [ file ... ]
.sh DESCRIPTION
.it Smdate
changes the last modified date of any files whose names
follow the first argument.
.it Smdate
can repair misset file modified dates caused by tp.
The date and time specified by the first argument
are printed before the changes are made.
The first
.it mm
is the month number;
.it dd
is the day number in the month;
.it hh
is the hour number (24 hour system);
the second
.it mm
is the minute number;
.it yy
is the last 2 digits of the year number and is optional.
For example:
.s3
.bd "	smdate 10080045 file"
.s3
sets the file modified date to Oct 8, 12:45 AM.
The current year is the default if no year is mentioned.
The system operates in GMT.
.it Smdate
takes care of the conversion to and from
local standard and daylight time.

.sh BUGS
The undocumented
.it smdate
call performs no file changes on most operating systems
since the distributed operating system has the code disabled.
.s3
.it Smdate
might interfere with as yet unimplemented file accounting procedures.
.s3
The
.it smdate
actions are also performed but in a different way by
.it tp.
.s3
Changing the modified date should be restricted to the super user.
