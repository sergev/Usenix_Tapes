\*- abort current spooled print file
.sh SYNOPSIS
.bd stoplp
.sh DESCRIPTION
.bd Stoplp
opens the file ``/usr/lpd/lock'', reads in the process-id number of the
line printer daemon, then sends it a signal (#15) which the daemon interprets
to mean that it should stop printing the file it is working on currently.
The file will be processed in the same manner as if it had finished printing
normally (i.e.: deleted in the normal case).
