.th SYMTAB VI 11-Aug-78
.sh NAME
symtab \*- Symbol Table Conversion Routine
.sh SYNOPSIS
.it symtab
infile outfile
.sh DESCRIPTION
.it Symtab
will read in the input file (a.out format absolute code),
strip off everything but the header and the symbol table,
change all entries which are marked "external" to "absolute external" while
discarding other entries, then fix up and write out the header.
.s3
The program is used to interface your own routines to already existent
software, such as
.it ULISP,
through the use of shared data.
.it Symtab
creates a "link table" which you can link up to your own compiled
(or assembled) routines.
.s3
Note that any shared data must be declared "external" or "global"
in your routines in order for the links to be made.
.s3
In usual usage, the already existent software is used as the input file,
the output file then consisting of a symbol table for data storages
available to be linked in with your own code as below:
.s3
.br
		symtab  oldstuff  linktable
.br
		ld  yourstuff.o  linktable
.s3
Of course, you have to have some way of calling your routines,
essentially restricting the use of 
.it symtab
to interfacing your routines to interpreted code (i.e. 
.it ULISP.)
That is, the already existent software must be able to call your routines,
so , if it does not have a call to them already, one must be installed. In
interpreted (interactive) code this is a minor matter. In non-interpretive
code there is little use for 
.it symtab
as the "old" software will have to be rewritten anyway.
.sh DIAGNOSTICS
Many error messages are given which point to the general location of trouble
but may not be very helpful, the worst being:
.s3
.br
		Error detected in symbol table
.br
		Program stopped
.s3
