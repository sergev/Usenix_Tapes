.th TRANS VI 11-Aug-78
.sh NAME
trans \*- PAL to UNIX as assembly language translator
.sh SYNOPSIS
.it trans
[input file]
.sh DESCRIPTION
.it Trans
will translate PAL-11R assembly language input
(standard input is the default)
into UNIX assembly language and write it out to the standard output.
It will convert UPPER CASE to lower case where necessary.
Certain "dot"
directives (ASCII, ASCIZ, WORD, BLKW etc.)
are translated into their UNIX assembler equivalents.
This means, of course, that certain PAL proper directives
will not be accepted by the UNIX assembler. For example, the
only ".IF" syntax allowed is:
.s3
.br
		.IF	NE,<expr>
.s2
Operators under PAL that are called different names under UNIX assembler
are properly translated.
It should be noted that with UNIX assembler some instructions
just do not exist: NOP, IOT, BPT and so on.
Due to the needs at the time this program was written,
some of these have been implemented as
"direct to digits" translation
("NOP" => "240" etc.).
.s3
Those constructions which do not exist under UNIX assembly,
such as MACROS, will be 'translated' but will be meaningless to
the assembler. It is best to read up on both type of assembly languages
before trusting the translation's ability to work.
.s3
This is a line by line translator. It usually is also a token
by token translator, sometimes actually character by character. As such,
it does not pay any attention to the context around it (with the exception
of "dot" directives).
.s3
Care should be taken that the input PAL is error free, 'cause what
you put in is what you get out.
.sh DIAGNOSTICS
Only 2 are given: one on error returned while trying to open the
input file, the other if an illegal character is detected during translation.
Both stop the program.
.s3
Unknown "dot" directives are commented out (EJECT, TITLE ad nauseum).

.sh BUGS
Perhaps unknown characters should just be ignored. 
.s2
If you had nice justified columns of 
operators, operands and comments
before the translation, you won't after (that would be difficult to
get around).
.s3
The translation takes a long time.
