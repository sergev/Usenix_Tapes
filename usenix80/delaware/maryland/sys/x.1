.th X I "12-March-80"
.sh NAME
x \*- communications program
.sh SYNOPSIS
.bd x
[ <ttyn> ]
.sh DESCRIPTION
.it "    X"
allows you to communicate with another computer system
(usually the univac 1100/40 or 1108)
with UNIX operating in a transparent mode.
The connection to the other computer is normally made through the dc11,
(/dev/tty0)
but this may be overridden by giving the optional
.bd "ttyn"
argument when
.bd x
is invoked.
The program operates in raw mode so that any character
may be transmitted, and any character received.
If you attempt to run the program when anyone else is running it,
or if there is a teletype process on the dc11,
the program will inform you of this and then terminate.
(The teletype process can be killed and restored using 'dctty'.)
.sp 1
    Typing an ESC (also called ALT: ctrl-'[') causes
.it x
to echo a BELL character, and accept the next character you
type as a command. The allowable commands are:
.sp 2
.lp +10 4
Q - Terminate
.it x
entirely.
.sp 1
.lp +10 4
P - Exits
.it x
temporarily, but leaves a process running so that if anything
comes from the communication link it will be sent to your terminal
bracketed:
.br
.ti +15
.ul
<<like this>>
.br
To re-enter
.it x
in the normal mode just run
.it x
again.
.sp 1
.lp +10 4
S - Alters the line speed of the communication device.
You will be prompted like this:
.ti +15
.ul
Line speed?
.br
to which you respond with the desired line speed followed by a
carriage return.
Do
.ul
not
use any characters other than digits to specify the speed.
The default speed is 1200 baud.
.sp 1
.lp +10 4
E - Turn on echoing by
.it x.
(This is the default mode.)
.sp 1
.lp +10 4
N - Turn off echoing by
.it x.
.sp 1
.lp +10 4
T - Enter transcript mode, the prompt:
.br
.ti +15
.ul
File name?
.br
will be displayed. Answer with the name of a writeable file, or a nonexistent
file in a writeable directory. From this point on, everything that is
recieved from the remote host is written into this file as well as being
displayed on your screen.
.sp 1
.lp +10 4
U - Turn off transcript mode. This command is implicit in the Q command.
.sp 1
.lp +10 4
X - Execute an arbitrary program in place of ``x''. The prompt:
.br
.ti +15
.ul
Command?
.br
will be displayed. You may answer it with a single shell command line.
The command will have
its standard input and standard output directed to the communication line
(unless you override it),
and its error output directed to your terminal. When the program
finishes executing,
``x'' will resume, and regain control of your terminal.
This is intended for special purpose programs that transfer files under some
host-dependent line protocol.
.sp 1
.lp +10 4
H - Print a brief form of this list.
.sp 1
.lp +10 4
B - Transmit a
.bd ``break''
signal to the remote host. The
.bd break
key on your terminal will
.bd not
work since the terminal handler ignores ``breaks''.
.sp 1
.lp +10 6
ESC\ -\ Transmit a single ESC.
.sp 2
.lp +0 0
.sh FILES
.lp +12 12
/etc/ttys - Used to find default communication tty line. This is indicated
by the character ``X'' as the third character in the appropriate line of
the file.
Also used to check if there is a login process on the requested tty line.
.lp +12 12
/dev/tty0 - default communications device
.lp +12 12
/dev/tty? - other communications devices
.lp +12 12
/tmp/comm.lock.? - lock file for tty?
.lp +0 0

DCTTY(I), SH(I)
.sh DIAGNOSTICS
Mostly self-explanatory. The ``link file'' referred to in the diagnostics
is the tty line that you are attempting to communicate over.

.sh BUGS
There are undocumented commands that have bugs.
.sp
Crashes occasionally, leaving your terminal in raw mode.
.sp
Someone can run
.bd x,
exit it with the ``P'' sub-command, then logout.
This leaves the lock file and a couple of processes lying around so that
no one else can run
.bd x
without cleaning up.
