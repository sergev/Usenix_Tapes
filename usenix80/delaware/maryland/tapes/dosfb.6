.th DOSFB VI 18-September-1979
.sh NAME
dosfb \*- convert DOS formatted binary
.sh SYNOPSIS
.bd dosfb
.sh DESCRIPTION
.it Dosfb
is a filter that converts
DOS formatted binary input to raw data output
eliminating the formatting information.
This input format produced
by DEC operating systems RT-11, DOS/BATCH-11, and RSX-11
can be read by
.it rdostape.
.it Dostape
can write in this format to allow for the accurate retrieval
of raw data from DOS format tapes.
.sh DIAGNOSTICS
A new formatted record begins with the first byte containing 1.
Other bytes between records are ignored.
The checksum information is not verified.
If the final record is incomplete, it is dumped as is.
