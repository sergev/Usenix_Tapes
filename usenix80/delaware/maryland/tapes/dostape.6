.sh DESCRIPTION
.it Dostape
writes files in DEC's DOS/BATCH-11 Peripheral Interchange Program (PIP)
magtape format.
The format written by
.it dostape
may be read by DEC operating systems RT-11, DOS/BATCH-11, and RSX-11.
The output tape must have been prepositioned using the Harvard
non-rewinding magtape device.
.it Dostape
individually writes files converting each name into a sometimes
abreviated DOS equivalent.
If there are no file parameters,
.it dostape
reads its standard input using the default name "UNIX.OUT".
.it Dostape
normally leaves the tape positioned just after the file mark
for the last file written,
in position for a subsequent
.it dostape
invocation or for marking with two additional file marks which
constitute the DOS end-of-tape convention.
.s3
Each DOS-PIP file on magtape consists of a 14 byte header record,
512-byte data records, and one file mark.
The first three words of the header consist of a radix-50
encoded name and extension using up to 6 characters for the name
and 3 characters for the extension.
.it Dostape
places only the final part of each path name into the header
omitting any previous directory names and slashes,
treating lower case a-z as upper case A-Z.
From this,
.it dostape
uses the first 6 filename characters before the last dot(.), if any,
for the encoded file name and the first three characters
after the last dot as the extension.
If the final part contains no dot,
the first three characters in excess of the first six become the extension.
The next two bytes are the user and group owner numbers,
the next word is the protection code,
and the last two words are the Julian date based on 1970
computed from the file modify date.
Logical records may extend across the 512-byte physical tape records.
.it Dostape
pads the last physical record with NULLs,
i. e. zero bytes, up to 512 bytes.
.s3
Options, except aliasing,
apply to all the following files but may be reset between files:
.s3
.lp +9 9
-special	writes to given special file instead of
default ``/dev/nrw_rmt0''.
.lp +9 9
-N	write to non-rewinding magtape raw device ``/dev/nrw_rmtN''
where the octal number N gives the unit number (default 0).
.lp +9 9
-n alias	treat the next argument as an alias in the the next header
in place of the actual file name.
.lp +9 9
-uN	place user ID N in header.
If N is omitted, the file owner is used (default).
.lp +9 9
-gN	place user group ID N in header.
If N is omitted, the file group owner is used (default).
.lp +9 9
-pN	place octal DOS protection code N in header.
If N is omitted, use the default 0233.
.lp +9 9
-a	produce DOS formatted ASCII output by inserting
a carriage return (015)
before each line feed (012).
.lp +9 9
-b	produce DOS binary unformatted output (default)
that copies bytes as is.
The last record may be null padded.
.lp +9 9
-fN	produce DOS formatted binary output
using input logical record size N.
If N is omitted, use 8192 bytes.
Prefixes each logical record with the format word 000001 and
a record byte count that includes the prefix words.
Suffixes each record with an additive one byte checksum
and NULL padding to a word boundary.
The final logical record may be foreshortened.
The padding does not preclude the exact recovery of formatted binary data.
.lp +9 9
-hN	write one formatted binary header record of length N
before the other formatted binary records.
This record is followed by zero padding to fill out a physical record.
If N is omitted, no header record is written.

For example
.lp +15 10
dostape	-4 /tmp/verylongname -a -g1 /tmp/short.c.s -h6 -f255 -n
fakename.pic /tmp/pic
.i0
.s1
.fi
writes three files to device /dev/nrw_rmt4.
The first unformatted file is called ``VERYLO.NGN'' in the tape header.
The second formatted ASCII file called ``SHORT.S'' precedes
each line feed with a carriage return.
The third formatted binary file called ``FAKENA.PIC'' uses the data
in /tmp/pic to produce a 6 byte logical record followed by 255 byte
logical records appropriate to images with 6 byte headers.
The last two files use group 1 instead of the original file group owner.
.sh DIAGNOSTICS
Physcial data I/O errors generate appropriate messages.
Expansion troubles indicate inadequate buffer space.
Illegal radix-50 characters are converted to
the ``unused'' character (035).
