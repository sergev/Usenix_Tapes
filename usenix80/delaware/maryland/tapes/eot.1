.sh NAME
eot, eot0, eot4 \*- advance magtape to end of tape mark
.sh SYNOPSIS
.bd eot
[
.bd \*-special
] [
.bd \*-[N]

.bd count
]
.sh DESCRIPTION
.it Eot
advances the tape to the next software end of tape mark
that consists of two file marks.
When using a standard tape name,
.it eot
then moves the tape backward to be immediately after the first
of the two marks.
From this position the tape can be extended with another file.
Otherwise the tape remains positioned immediately after both marks.
A count of the number of file marks passed is displayed.
.s3
Alternative names for
.it eot
such as
.it eot4
provide a different default tape device
according to the last digit of the name.
.s3
The options either specify a non-default device
or limit the number of file marks that may be passed:
.s3
.lp +9 9
-special	advances the given special file instead of
default ``/dev/nrw_rmt0''.
No backup is performed after advancing.
.lp +9 9
-N	advances the magtape raw device ``/dev/nrw_rmtN''
where the one digit octal number N gives the unit number (default 0).
Afterward the tape is backed up to between the file marks
using back up device ``/dev/bu_rmtN''.
If N is omitted 4 is used.
.lp +9 9
count	limits the number of file marks passed while searching
for the software end-of-tape.
A leading zero specifies an octal number.
If only a zero is given,
.it eot
takes no action.
.i0
.fi
.sh DIAGNOSTICS
Complains if the tape drive is offline, already occupied,
or if reading the first record of any file being passed
generates a hardware error.
If interrupted,
.it eot
displays a count of file marks to be passed before stopping.

.sh BUGS
The backing-up version of the tape driver must be installed.
.s3
If the first record of any file passed is longer than 44544 bytes,
a hardware record length error occurs.
