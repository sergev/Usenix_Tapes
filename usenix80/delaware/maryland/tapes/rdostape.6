.sh DESCRIPTION
.it Rdostape
reads files in DEC's DOS/BATCH-11 Peripheral Interchange Program (PIP)
magtape format.
If parameters specify a particular file name or UIC,
the tape is first searched forward until a suitable file header
is found or a double file mark (EOT) is reached.
If the appropriate file is found,
.it rdostape
bypasses the header record and passes the remaining records
to the standard output as is, regardless of the length of the records
(up to 44544 bytes)
or the format used to write them.
If no file is specified,
the file at the current tape position is read,
omitting the header record.
After a file is transfered,
the tape is left positioned after the file mark that ends the file.
If no satisfactory file is found,
the tape is positioned just after the double file mark
that defines end of tape (EOT).
.s3
.it Rdostape
converts file names into a sometimes abreviated DOS equivalent.
The first three words of the DOS-PIP header consist of a radix-50
encoded name and extension using up to 6 character for the name
and 3 characters for the extension.
.it Rdostape
examines only the final part of each path name
omitting any previous directory names and slashes,
treating lower case a-z as upper case A-Z.
From this,
.it rdostape
uses the first 6 filename characters before the last dot(.), if any,
to compare with the encoded file name and the first three characters
after the last dot as the extension.
If the final part contains no dot,
the first three characters in excess of the first six become the extension.
The next two bytes are the user and group owner numbers.
The format used
may also be read by DEC operating systems RT-11, DOS/BATCH-11, and RSX-11.
.s3
The options specify either a particular file or non-default input device:
.s3
.lp +9 9
-special	read from given special file instead of
default ``/dev/nrw_rmt0''.
.lp +9 9
-N	read from non-rewinding magtape raw device ``/dev/nrw_rmtN''
where the one digit octal number N gives the unit number (default 0).
.lp +9 9
-uN	search for user ID N in header skipping files with other IDs.
.lp +9 9
-gN	search for user group ID N in header skipping files with other IDs.
.lp +9 9
-sN	seek past N physical records before reading tape.
If N is zero or omitted, the first record read will be the first
in the file even if it is the header record.
Thus by not specifying a particular file,
any format data may be read as is.

.sh DIAGNOSTICS
Physical I/O data errors generate appropriate messages.
Illegal radix-50 characters are converted to
the ``unused'' character (035).
