.th ROLLOUT VIII 26-October-79
.sh NAME
rollout \*- roll out rk disks to magtape in ROLLIN format
.sh SYNOPSIS
.bd /etc/rollout
[ - ] special_file ...
.sh DESCRIPTION
.it Rollout
creates magtape files on /dev/nrw_rmt0 in the format
which can be read by DEC's stand-alone program ROLLIN.
The files contain unformatted copies of entire rk disk platters
suitable for restoring garbled disks.
The tape must be positioned before writing the data.
.s3
ROLLIN format for the first file on tape consists of:
.s3
.ft I
.lp +13 13
record	length (subparts)
.ft R
.lp +13 13
tape_label	14 bytes: name.ext (3 words),
UIC [1,1] (1 word),
protection code 0233 (1 word),
Julian_date from 1970 (2 words)
.lp +13 13
bootstrap	512 bytes
.lp +13 13
ROLLIN_image	10240 bytes
.lp +13 13
reel_label	512 bytes: 1 (1 word), 0 (255 words)
.lp +13 13
data	8192 bytes for 304 records
.lp +13 13
data	4096 bytes for one last record
.lp +13 13
file_mark	one per file; 3 after last file.
.i0
.s3
.fi
If the first file to be written is not the first file on the tape,
use the option \*- to suppress writing the ROLLIN boot records.
Subsequent files on the tape omit the bootstrap and image
of the ROLLIN program.
After the last file is written,
.it rollout
positions the tape just beyond the first file mark.
Thus the tape need not be repositioned to write additional files.
.s1
The file label name in the label record is encoded in three
.it radix-50
words.
Two words consist of UNX suffixed with the last
three characters of the special file name.
The third word is the extension .ROL
but is not used in specifying file names to ROLLIN.
For example,
when the file /dev/rrk0 is written,
UNXRK0.ROL is used as the file name and extension in the tape label.
.s1
The modified version of
.it dd
that supports the
.it seek
option can reread files written by
.it rollout.
For example,
the command
.s3
.ti +8
dd if=/dev/nrw_rmt0 of=/dev/rrk1 bs=8192 seek=4
.s3
restores the contents of /dev/rrk1 from the first file on tape unit 0.
After the tape has been positioned at some non-initial file,
.it dd
uses the
.it seek=2
option.

.sh DIAGNOSTICS
Physical I/O errors produce a message and stop the transfer.
The bootstrap and ROLLIN image file must be present.

.sh BUGS
A tape handler that supports a non-rewinding close must be
added to the operating system before using
.it rollout.
.s3
Only two file marks are written after the last file
by the Harvard tape handler.
ROLLIN expects three file marks,
so the file must be re-opened for writing to place
a third file mark on tape, e.g.
.s3
.ti +8
cat /dev/null > /dev/nrw_rmt0 .
.s3
Non-rewinding magtape unit 0 is the only output device.
.s3
Files in the ROLLIN format can only be reread without
console error messages, if
.it dd
has been modified to allow seeking
.it (seek=)
over the 4 (or 2) initial records instead of having to try
to read them with the
.it skip=
command.
