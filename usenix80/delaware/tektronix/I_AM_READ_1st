To read this tape use a 800 bpi 9 track tape drive.
The format is UNIX TP format.

Find yourself a lot of scratch space.
Type:

	cd <Scratch directory>
	tp mv0 make.dirs
	sh make.dirs

You will now have the proper directories to read the tape.

Now Type:
	tp mx

I am assuming you have copy of the V7 Archive Program.
It is also called: newarch(1) on the 3rd distribution tape
from USENIX.

Every directory has been archived in a file called:
	cont.a
Excute:
	sh de_arch

To de-archive everything.  Warning, this make take a while.


Good Luck.
	sh rm_arch
Should remove the archive files.

For those of you that have space problems:
	sh de_rm_arch
Will do both operations at once.
