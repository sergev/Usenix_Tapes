This directory contains the first Tektronix Unix
Distribution.  The subdirectories are:

	bb.post - Our Bulliten Board Programs
	pascal  - VU-Pascal for V7, V6 and PWB
	sh - New Features in the Bourne Shell
	tty - Super TTY Driver.
	include - our include files

In MOST (in think ALL) case we used MACROS when
we modified code.  Thus if you turn off our macros
your will get VIRGIN Bell Code.

If you have problems, we will try to help you.
