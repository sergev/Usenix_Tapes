It should be noted that we have pushed about a great deal of
code through this PASCAL system.  We have just finished pushing
a 5500-6000 line Pascal Graphics System through.  We have
found the system to far better than the Berkeley system for
production work.

The BB/POST system allows about 200 users to communicate
fairly well.  We like it better than news(1).

The TTY(4) driver was forced on us.  We MUST be able to
run 8 bit data between two 'TERMINALS' with flow control.
The currently support MACHINE to MACHINE with it between:
	UNIX <--> PDP-10
	UNIX <--> PDP-11/RT
	UNIX <--> Graphics Frame Buffer
	UNIX <--> Printronix with QMS/Serial Interface
	UNIX <--> CDC Cyber Under NOS ***


***  The Cyber interface is a little baroque.

The SHELL Changes came about because our secretaries (and other
engineers) complained that ^D was to close to ^S.  Also, alot
of people like to stay logged into the machine.  When they are,
if they are not doing anything, they wanted to know when they
recieved mail.


The Fixes to Nroff/Troff and MS are not include here.
They will be available soon.  We have pre-distributed a version
to the Uinversity of Waterloo.  When we get a little feedback,
we will sned it out.
