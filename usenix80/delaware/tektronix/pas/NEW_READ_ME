Due to the problems with porting this system to
PWB and VERSION7, I have tried to follow Andy's
Conventions.

First:
	read Andy's READ_ME's.  

Second:
	get REAL familar with the TREE of files.

Third:
	create a: local.h  for your system.
	If you are a V6 system DO NOT DEFINE ANYTHING!
	If you are a PWB-V1.0 system, define PWB.
	If you are a PWB-V2.0 or later, define VERSION7
	If you are a VERSION7 system, define VERSION7

Fourth:
	Go for it!!!!!


Five:
	Have Beer!  You just finished a lot of work.

If you have problems, call me.  I'll try to help.
