This directory containes the source to the MAN pages
for the VU-PASCAL system.
The Subdirectories V6 and V7 contain the sources.
The Files ending with a lower case "p" are the V7 Manual Pages.
This conforms to the new naming conventions that Bell produced.
The V6 files are name as they came from VU.
Under V7, we moved some of the manual pages to Section 3.
This was done to more compatible with the Bell Manual.

Under the V7 system we had a small naming problem.
The File called: lib2.3p   Is a little weird.  Some might
think it should be under Section 2.  I felt that they really
represent SUBROUTINES and the BELL section for Subroutines
is found as Section 3.
