To make this run at Tek Labs, under PWB, I have installed the
VU Assembler as vuas.  Similarly the loader is vuld.
The reason is that with V7 coming, I do not want to duplicate
my effort.  I will have to modify the Bell assembler
and linker to handle the 'long' file bug desribed
below.

Under Version 7, the Bell Distributed linker has problems.
Basicly, the $%^&*() that wrote it, declared the size
variables in the header to be INT not UNSIGNED.  See a.out(5)
for details.  The version of the linker that I include here
called: v7.ld.c  in the Bell V7 linker with the corrections.



Naming Conventions:
	org.ld.c	The orginal Vu Linker un-touched
	pwb.ld.c	The orginal PWB Linker un-touched
	vu.ld.c		The VU Linker after I added the new archive
				formating stuff.
	v7.ld.c		The V7 linker with the needed changes.
