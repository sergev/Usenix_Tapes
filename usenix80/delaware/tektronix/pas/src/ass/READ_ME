The PWB/UNIX C Preprocessor will blow up on these
files.  Under V6, which is what VU used; the
pre-proccessor was part of the cc command.  I
haved added to the run files the use of ./vucc ....
I have also created a copy of their compiler in this
directory.  We can not fix our pre-proccessor becuase
it it written in lex; and lex will not run on our
machine.
