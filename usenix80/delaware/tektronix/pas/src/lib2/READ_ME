The files called: srun.c and erun.c both reference 3 non-existant
files: mpx.[es] pkon.[es] and pkoff.[es].  That is because they have
not yet been written.  They may never be.  These are new parts of the
Op-Sys and we just included them in the makefiles to make
it easier later if we do add them.

Some of these calls are untested.  We had no code that used them.
The most fragant offender of this is found in the interperter
Sys Calls for V7. The Code for: lock, umask, ioctl, utime and phys
have never been tested.  We just copied simliar code from other
calls and assembled them.  I am not sure that ANY will work,
because of the screwy new calling conventions for these sys calls.
R0 is not used in the call.  The params are all left on the stack.
The MON call of the em1 interpeter makes some assumptions about
the sys call interface, and these may not be valid. 
We did not try this because I leave for the UNIX Conference
tommorrow and I want to include these on the tape.
If you are making these calls from PASCAL I wonder about your
sanity anyway, so....  It's your funeral.
