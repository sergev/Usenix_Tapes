The sources for csrc:pr.a AND esrc:pr.a AND ssrc:pr.a have been
modified according to the notes "BUGS in PASCAL distribution
from V.U." ----- Clem Cole

Also please find the extra archive file SaveV7:pr.a
This contains the FUTURE V7 linkage routines for
the C Math Library.  Unfortunately the C linkage conventions
are NOT YET supporetd by the compiler.  When they are,
we can replace the files in the ssrc:pr.a library
with the ones by the same name from SaveV7:pr.a.
