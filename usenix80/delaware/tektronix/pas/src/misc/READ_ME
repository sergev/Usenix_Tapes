A new file was added called menu.  It is a editor
menu file.  The preprocessor will leave C comment lines
around in the output file.  The boot shell files
will run the C preproccessor on decode.p and encode.p.
It will include a lot of blank linesfrom an include
file.  It will also leave the comments from the include
file.  

ASSERT:  These comment will ALWAYS be before the
first line of true code.

ASSERT:  The first line of 'true' code will
always be a pascal comment begining with -> {

The menu will place a { in the front of the file
and a } in front of the first pascal comment.  The net
result is that the C comments are 'commented' out.
