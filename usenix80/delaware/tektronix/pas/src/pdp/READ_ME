I fixed the run file to not use the -f flag for
floating point.

I found that most of the files had an extranious
NULL in the file.  This was causing the C preprocessor
to toss its cookies.  I removed these and
evything is fine.  I had to move one routine
in pdp43.c.  I also had to fix some of the x=x
operators in some of the files.  These authors
never used spaces for the x's in the above and
when got a few warnings, after some macros expanded.
I added spaces where needed and everything is
peachy!
