This directory contains the changes made to the V7 shell (Bourne shell)
at Tektronix.  The changes are:

1. Reset control-O (output flusing) at every PS1 prompt (associated
with the Tek version of the terminal driver).

2. Exit from the top level interactive shell ONLY with the logout command,
not control-D.  This prevents inadvertant logouts.

3. When sitting idle, check to see if new mail has arrived in the
$MAIL drop.  If so, type out "You have mail" followed by a bell.

These chages are fairly trivial, the only tricky stuff is in properly
handling the error return from read after getting (and responding to)
the alarm signal.

The code has been tested fairly extensively.  We have been running it
of a fairly "standard" V7 kernel for about 6 months.
