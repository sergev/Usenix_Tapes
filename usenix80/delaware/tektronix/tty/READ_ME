This directory contains modifications to the Version 7 tty driver to:

	support the DEC style control characters (^S,^S,^O,^U,^C)

	provide a working TANDEM mode

	support flow control using the DTR/CTS lines (even in RAW mode)
	(separately enabled for input vs output)

	optionally echo backspace as <bs><sp><bs> for refresh terminals

	optionally echo '$' for ESCAPE

	optionally echo ^letter for most control characters

	allow EOT to be output in cooked mode

	support 8 bit output while retaining 7 bit cooked input

	allow the sensing of HUPCLS and XCLUDE modes.

	support modem control on DL11-E

	support packet mode and mpx on DZ11 and KL11/DL11.


All changes are implemented by using #ifdef.  See tty.h and tty.c for
more explanation.

We are currently running a fairly large 11/70 with a serial I/O
configuration of:

	6 DEC DZ11
	1 Able DMAX/11 (DEC DH11 compatible)
	1 DL11-W (console)
	packet mode I/O
	mpx

We also have a Printronix P300 printer running off a serial line
(Able DMAX/11) at 9600 baud and are experiencing no problems.

No changes were made to /usr/sys/sys routines to support any of this
(all changes are in /usr/sys/dev and /usr/src/cmd).

Files included here are:

/usr/sys/h/tty.h	(has #defines to selectively include the changes)

/usr/sys/dev/tty.c	(documents most of the changes)

/usr/sys/dev/dz.c       (extensively changed)

/usr/sys/dev/dh.c

/usr/sys/dev/dhdm.c

/usr/sys/dev/dhfdm.c    (unchanged-included for completeness)

/usr/sys/dev/kl.c       (extensively changed)

/usr/sys/dev/lp.c       (minor change-unrelated to the rest of this stuff)

/usr/sys/conf/mkconf.c  (reworked to properly support DZ11, LP11, mpx, and packet mode)

/usr/src/cmd/getty.c         (reworked - fairly obvious changes)

/usr/src/cmd/init.c          (reworked to properly implement kill -2 1)

/usr/src/cmd/stty.c          (reworked to support new modes)

Makefile-conf	(our version of /usr/sys/conf/Makefile)

Makefile-sys	(our version of /usr/sys/sys/Makefile)

Makefile-dev	(our version of /usr/sys/dev/Makefile)

make.Makefile	(a shell script to aid in creating Makefiles)

/usr/man/man1/stty.1t

/usr/man/man4/tty.4t

/usr/man/man4/termcable.4t    (describes our terminal cable)

/usr/man/man4/modemcable.4t	(describes our modem interface cable
	that supports the speed indicator line on Vadic 3467/Bell 212A)

/usr/man/man4/dataio.4t       (describes a cable to attach a Data I/O
	system 19 PROM programmer to a terminal cable)

We have tested this code fairly extensively and have been running it
for about 2 months.  There does not appear to be any major preformance
penalties (except the additional kernel space) as compared to the Bell
Version 7 implementation.
