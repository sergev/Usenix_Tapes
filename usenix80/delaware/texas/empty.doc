EMPTY(II)                        02/20/79                       EMPTY(II)

NAME
	empty - check whether a pipe or tty is empty

SYNOPSIS
	(empty=55.; not in assembler)
	(file descriptor in r0)
	sys empty

	empty(fildes)

DESCRIPTION
	Given a file descriptor returned from a pipe call, or one that
	refers  to a teletype,  empty checks to see  whether there are
	characters to be read from the pipe/tty.  More precisely,  it
	checks  to see whether a read on  that file  descriptor would
	cause the calling process to be put to sleep.

	Empty returns 1 if a read on fildes would hang; otherwise 0.

	(Note: a read on an empty pipe with one end closed returns
	       EOF rather than going to sleep; empty returns 0 in this
	       case.)

SEE ALSO
	pipe(II), dup(II), close(II), read(II)

DIAGNOSTICS
	The error bit (c-bit) is set for an unknown file descriptor or
	for a file descriptor that doesn't describe a pipe or tty.
	From c a -1 indicates an error.
