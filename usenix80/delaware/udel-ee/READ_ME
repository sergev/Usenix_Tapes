This is a quick copy of the distribution of the C compiler
for the 6800 micro written by Dave Sincoskie at the University
of Delaware.  This work was done a couple of years ago and
Dave is no longer here.  You should address your questions to

	Rich Hammond
	Dept. of Electrical Engineering
	Univ. of Delaware
	Newark, Delaware  19711
	(302) 738-8005

We also have a C compiler for the IBM Series/1.  You can contact Rich
for information on that too.
