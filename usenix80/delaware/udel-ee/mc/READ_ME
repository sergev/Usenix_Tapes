This is the distribution for the M6800 C compiler.  The compiler sources
are in ./src, and there is a run file ./run.  BE CAREFUL of the run file.
It will work, and install the compiler correctly on our system, but there
are a lot of implicit assumptions about where things go.  Basically, things
look like:
	/lib/mc -- contains most everything.  The compiler code
		   mc0, mc1, mc2, calink, mcca.  Also contains
		   the library source files (like io.s).

	/lib/mc/src -- contains all of the C source for the library
		       files in above directory.

	/bin/mc -- the compiler preprocessor.

If you want to move things around, you will have to edit ./src/mc.c.  I have
tried to pull out all of the file definitions and put them in the front of
the program, so all you should have to do is change all of the initialized
variables that you want.  They should be obvious, but I won't guarantee it.
Also, before the compiler is tried, read ./src/mcinfo.
