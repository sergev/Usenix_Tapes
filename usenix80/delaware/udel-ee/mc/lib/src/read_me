This is the library source directory.  It has two canned routines to "build"
a few library routines.  The first is "makeio" which will create a file
io.s which has 6800 compatable printf, putchar, and getchar routines.  You
should move io.s to a suitable library (the one we use is /lib/mc/io.s).

The second routine is makelib, which will build a small library of ".s"
routines.  It needs one argument, which is the name of the directory
to move the files into once built.

The mc compiler must be installed prior to doing all of this.
