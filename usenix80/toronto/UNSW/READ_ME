This represents a selective sample of UNIX software from the University
of New South Wales, also includes software from Univeristy of Wollongong
and University of Queensland.

Some of the goodies are:
	* highly modified, optimised system capable of handling 50 users
	  simultaneously from a user pop. of 1300.
	* to accompany above are modified non-resident source
	  and documentation.
	* 'sysdump' a program for analysing system crash dumps, has
	  proved extremely useful in the past.
	* C subroutine package for TEKTRONIX terminals
	* yet another assembler-assembler; allows easy contruction
	  of assemblers for micros etc. Half-day to construct 6800
	  assembler is typical.
	* relocatable assemblers and loaders for 6800, 8080 and Z80
	  (not the assembler-assembler)
	* troff using versatec as output device !!
	* batch system for Kronos Export/Import and QEI.
