These files are relics from long ago.
They are included here only because they have been superceded by
our version of export. (Some are a little rough, take care)

batch.h		I dont really know why this is here. You may need it for the
		others.

jtd.c		Jtd as it was originally written. (very simple)

macsup.mac	This version has more features but uses setpsw system call.
		The two will be reconciled soon...

print.c		Uses the lineprinter direct. Locks out other output.
		We now use lpr-lpd.

tell.s		Very simple.

text1.s		Original shared area. Look for yourself.
