DEC FORTRAN

Recently Craig McGregor of UNSW's architecture facility has spent
considerable  time  improving  and debugging the linker that came
with the Princeton version of DEC's RT-11 FORTRAN compiler.   The
linker has overlay facilities added and has also lost some of its
bugs. It supercedes "linkr" which came with the  MACRO  assembler
from  Harvard.   The  linker, together with the FORTRAN compiler,
MACRO assembler and object librarian are available from AGSM.
