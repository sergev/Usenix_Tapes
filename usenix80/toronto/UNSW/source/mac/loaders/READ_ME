This directory contains the necessary information to generate and install
the UQ linking loaders for the M6800, Intel 8080 and Z80 microcomputers.
This software is compatible with the UQ assemblers for the same machines.

You should read the user's manuals which are *.n, and may be made readable
by nroff -ms.

You must be able to write on a directory /micro/ld

The files necessary may be produced by executing the "run" file on this dir-
ectory. The files produced are:

	/micro/ld/	xld - common executable file (all loaders)
			m68.spc - standard specification
			i80.spc   files for the given
			z80.spc   loaders

	/usr/bin/	mld - command files which execute /micro/xld
			ild   with argument telling it which machine
			zld   to load for

You should be careful of overwriting existing files with these new ones.

Intermediate files created during the execution of "run" and which are also
retained on the current directory afterwards may also overwrite old files.
An examination of "run" will allow you to anticipate what files are in
danger.

A suggested approach is to do all the work on an empty "/micro/ld".
