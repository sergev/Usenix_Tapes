dot12 is a bfont input file to produce the fonts R.12 and S.12;
dotI produces a one character font consisting of a large olde
englishe I in font file E.28

troff.cprog can be input to troff followed by a c program to
print it in 12 "point" type.

Note that fonts I.12 and B.12 can be just links to R.12,
and that use of the request .bd to get bold-face is recommended.
