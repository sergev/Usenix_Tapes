	motorola 6800


All other machines (z80 8086 6502 etc) that are
configured have not as yet been documented in this
way.  Documentation will be available within the
next few days.

Subtle differences may exist in the assembler configurations
which may need explanation before users can 'adapt' existing
programs for assembly by MAC.
