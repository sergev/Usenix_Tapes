Here is where outputs are produced.
As previously mentioned they are verbose (to say the least).
The best method is to say 'run > /dev/lp'.

coredump	This produces an octal dump of the core dump with
		namelist symbols interspersed. These are useful when
		all else fails, and for tracking down corrupted core.

run		This does the lot. Say 'run' for a description of how to use
		it. It executes the go files produced from the source.
