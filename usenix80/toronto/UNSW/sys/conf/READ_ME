This directory contains only the stuff Ianj uses to make his system. The
more major modifications cannot be found here (BIG_UNIX etc). For these
you must look in directory 'other' or 'notused' (I am not sure of the rule).
READ_ME's abound....

c.hp0		Agsm configuration. Changes here too.

l70.s		Needed for m70.s. Understands 70s and 45s better.

m70.s		Handles 1170 much better. Parity, stack limit, CPU error
		all understood.

mk		Make a 70 system.

notused		Like it says. Interesting though.

other		Mostly debugging stuff. Have a look.

powerf.s	Dummy power failure handler.

powerf.s-new	This almost recovers from power failures most times.
		All it needs is a bit of work so that power failures in
		interrupts do the right thing...

source		Directory of sources. (sysfix sysld)

sysfix		This sysfix has slightly more. (Details and Diagnostics)
