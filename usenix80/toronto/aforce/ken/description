Description of Edition 3, change 4
Change /etc/init to /sys/init.
Fix 2 bugs having to do with hung processes on hangup.
	1.  When dmint routine detects a hangup it now makes
	sure it unblocks all waiting I/O, and wakes up all
	waiting on blocked I/O.
	Change is to dmint in dhdm.c.

	2.  Hangups are now given priority in the signal
	system over all other signals except KILL.  This
	prevents the DEL signal generated by spurious line
	transients at hangup from being posted over the
	hangup for that tty.
	Change is to psignal in sig.c.

Tune number of character (clist) buffers to system sizes.
This should prevent users from clogging the system with long
input lines, and keep lots of simultaneous I/O from being
lost.

Implement system call for system ID information.

Changed wraparound pid from 0 to 100.

Partially implemented ability to have more than 127 directories
under another directory.
Removed 24 April 79 by lazear.
