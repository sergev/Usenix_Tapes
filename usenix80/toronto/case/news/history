===========> Important Note <===========

On Nov. 6, a new version of the shell
(the Case shell) will be installed.
It is upward compatible with the current
shell in almost all respects.  The only
significant change is in the semantics of
the $B variable, described later.

The Case shell supports either the .login
or .profile files.

The Case shell initializes several shell
variables for the user:

	$B - directory search list for commands
	$G - name of glob
	$I - login name
	$M - prompt string
	$N - number of args to shell
	$P - processes not waited for
	$S - login directory, effects cd without arg
	$T - login tty
	$U - user dir, .. from login dir
	$W - where, first component of login dir
	$Z - name of shell

Any of theses variables may be changed by
the user.  Some will have an effect, some
will not.

The $B variable controls the order in which
directories are searched when looking for
commands.  It has the following value by default:

	:/bin:/usr/bin

The directories are separated by colons.  The
colon at the beginning causes the current
directory to be searched.  For users using
their own bin directory, $B may be set to:

	:/case/usr/name/bin:/bin:/usr/bin

$B may be initialized by including a .path file
in your login directory.  The first line of
.path will be used to initialize $B.

$S is used to control the directory changed
to if cd is issued without an argument.
$Z effects the shell used to execute shell
command files.
$G effects the glob used.
$M effects the prompt.


	===> also <===

The old version of nroff is now called onroff.
onroff will be removed soon, users should
convert to the new version of nroff.
The new version of nroff (previously nnroff)
is now nroff.  The old version of neqn has
been replaced with the new version.

There are now available for public use a set of include files hidden in
/usr/include. These include files contain (among other things)
definitions for many commonly used structures (e.g. directories,
archives, a.out formats, stat structure,...).  Most files are heavily
commented and should be used whenever possible to promote a common set
of variable names for commonly used items.  To include these files
automatically when compiling an include line such as:
	# include "file.h"
should be used.  New include files will be added from time to time, so
check news for information.

New Unix Commands:

lpdkill - used to kill the line printer daemon
	  when something goes wrong (out of paper,
	  paper not aligned, printing object files).
	  lpdkill does not clean up /case/lpd.
	  you should have some idea of what you're
	  doing before invoking this command.

nmount  - like mount but not as verbose.  it assumes
	  you want to mount something in /dev on a
	  directory in the root, for example:

		nmount rk2 mnt

	  is equivalent to:

		mount /dev/rk2 /mnt

	  nmount may be invoked without logging in using
	  the mount command.


From news Wed Jul 26 12:07:16 1978
There are two new options to the "ls" and "dir" commands:

	w - suppress date info, when used with l option or dir command
	q - do not sort list before printing

The new version of the C compiler is now running.
The following documentation is available under /case/man:

	newc	- describes additions/changes in C
	cc	- describes new options on cc command
	ar	- describes new archiver
	ld	- describes new ld used with new ar
	stdio	- describes the new (better) I/O library

The old C is available as the backup compiler; use the -B
option on the cc command.

If (when) you have any problems, let me know.

Starting next week, 04/06/78, there will be a new version
of "ar" and "ld" on the system.  The new version is incompatible
with the old format, so all libraries (archives) must be converted
to the new format.  See /case/man/new_ar for more details.
The new ar and ld are available now under the names "nar" and "nld".

There is another (!) 8080 assembler on Unix.
See /case/man/as80.

From shannon Wed Mar 22 19:27:47 1978
The proto command now works; see /case/man/proto.

From shannon Tue Mar 21 18:35:55 1978
A new status command, fs, is available on Unix.  Fs tells you
about open files, etc.  See /case/man/fs.

The Teco editor is now available under Unix.
Teco is a powerful character-oriented editor
available under several DEC operating systems,
such as RSX-11 and TOPS-10.

Dave Kuchta was primarily responsible for bringing
Teco up under Unix.  Any problems should be directed
to him.  Documentation is available from Dave Kuchta
or Bill Shannon.

An improvement has been added to the C compiler; a new type
of comment is accepted.  Comments may be started with // and
end at the end of the line.  For example:

		while ((c = getchar()) != '\n')	  // until end of line
			putchar(c);		  // copy chars




Unix Users:

	A new version of Unix is now running that includes
improved terminal service facilities.  Several of these features
have necessitated changes in the standard Unix character set.
The erase and interrupt characters have been changed, among
others.  Several new features have also been added.  See the
table below.  The erase and kill characters are handled differently
for crt's; if you change them to any other characters, they will
be handled as before.


	old char	new char	meaning
	--------	--------	-------
	rubout		ctrl-C		interrupt
	ctrl-\		ctrl-B		quit
	   #		rubout		erase
	   @		ctrl-U		kill
			ctrl-S		freeze output
			ctrl-Q		unfreeze output
			ctrl-O		flush output
