Due to the heavy use of the Printronix printer by the Network
a new option has been added to opr to allow spooling of printouts
to a selected printer.  The -P# option specifies which printer to
use.  Currently -P0 indicates the Printronix (default)
and -P1 selects the Tally.  Check /case/man/opr for more information.

Also, the ability to redirect output to /dev/lp has been removed;
all output to a printer must now be spooled via opr.

There is a new library subroutine available - scan. Scan is
a generalized command scanner for CRT's. For more info check
/case/man/scan.

Any comments/complaints should be mailed to leffler.

Several new features have been added to login.
It is now possible to have login keep track of
the last time you logged in.  This information
is used to determine if you have seen the
message of the day, so that you will only see
it once.  To use this feature, create a file
called ".llog" of zero length. (Use:
	cp /dev/null .llog
to create it.)  The modification date of .llog
determines the last time you logged in.  Each
time you log in, you will get a message like:
	Last login: <date>
Removing the .llog file disables this feature.

A mechanism has also been installed whereby
certain classes of users are prevented from
using certain terminals.  (You will get the
message "Permission denied" if this happens.)
If this causes you any problems, mail shannon.

A new line printer spooler has been installed on Unix.
The following options are now available on opr:

	-H	cause a header page to be printed
	-J	set job name on header page to next arg
	-C	set third line of header page to next arg
	-p	print files using pr
	-#	# is a number, print # copies

Common usage of opr used to be:

	pr *.c | opr

This can now be done more efficiently with the -p option:

	opr -p *.c

In the near future, it will not be possible to send things
directly to the line printer (>/dev/lp), users should use
opr instead.

Note that by default there is no header page.  The header page
is mostly an experiment; if you like it, let me know.

There is a new program on Unix called indent.  It reformats
C programs according to certain rules.  See /case/man/indent.
