Unix Users:

	A new version of Unix is now running that includes
improved terminal service facilities.  Several of these features
have necessitated changes in the standard Unix character set.
The erase and interrupt characters have been changed, among
others.  Several new features have also been added.  See the
table below.  The erase and kill characters are handled differently
for crt's; if you change them to any other characters, they will
be handled as before.


	old char	new char	meaning

	ctrl-\		ctrl-B		quit
