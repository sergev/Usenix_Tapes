INTRODUCTION: 
Search, is a multiplayer action game requiring quick reflexes and an
ability to spot "invisible" players. Up to twelve people may be playing
Search at any given time. Players may enter and leave the game, at any
time. This document describes the rules and commands of the game.
.PP
GAME INVOCATION: Search is invoked by executing
.br
/nmpc/usr/ordy/bin/search
.br
It is assumed that the reader has some primative knowledge of the UNIX
environment.
(NOTE: as alot of useful programs reside in /nmpc/usr/ordy/bin, it is
usually a good idea to add it to your .path file. If the .path file
is unknown to you, ask about it.)
.PP
ENTERING THE GAME: Once search begins executing, it will usually print
a line or two of current status information. This pregame message
is used to inform users of any changes or additions. A player can
either start a game, or join a game in progress.
If a player is starting a game, he (or she) will receive a prompt
which looks like:
.br
players:
.br
At this point the first player may type several things. If a newline
is typed, the game will start in ten seconds. If the last letter
of a UNIX terminal name is typed, that terminal will receive the
message:
.br
SEARCH SOON!!!
.br
After the players prompt, always respond with a newline (after the entering
of terminal names if any are given)
This feature is therefore used when a person starting a game wishes
to inform other terminals of the impending game. If a player is
joining a game already in progress, he (or she) will automatically
enter the game, with no players prompt. There is a delay when entering the middle of a game,
usually from 1 to 60 seconds.
.PP
THE UNIVERSE: All players are located in the same universe. The universe
is represented as a two dimentional X,Y coordinate system, of size
256 X 256. The universe "wraps" around on itself. That is, the coordinate
one greater than 127 is -128. This applies to both the X and Y direction.
The wrap around implies that continued travel in one direction will
eventually bring a player to a previously traveled location. It is never
possible to get too far away from the action!
.PP
THE BASICS: The goal is to accumulate points. Points can be received
by attacking and successfully damaging
other players, or alien spacecraft.
The objects in the universe are:
.br
.ti 10
Starbases: Represented as an asterisk '*'.
.ti 10
Normal aliens: Represented as a pound sign '#'.
.ti 10
X aliens: Represented as a capital X 'X'.
.ti 10
Shankers: Represented as an at-sign '@'.
.ti 10
Torpedoes: Represented as a plus sign '+'.
.ti 10
Quartone: Represented as a somewhat round group of
.ti 10
percent signs '%'.
.ti 10
Shrapnel: Represented as a period '.'.
.ti 10
Other players: Represented as a capital letter, the
.ti 10
same as their UNIX terminal name. (A,B,C,D,E,F,G,H,
.ti 10
J,K,L,M,N,O at
the present time).
.PP
It is possible to view players as lower case letters, see the information
on team playing, below.
To exist in the universe and do battle, a player must expend energy.
A player is removed from a game if his energy reaches 0. The
manipulation of energy will be explained later.
.PP
THE VIEW SCREEN: When a player enters the game, his terminal is transformed
into the console of his space ship. The most prominent part of the
console is the view port, complete with cross hairs. Around the view port
are several status displays, which inform the player of the the status of
his ship.
A players current position, which is constantly updated in the
status display on the upper right portion of the screen, is defined
to be the point in the center of the cross hairs. A player never
"see's" himself, as the view screen is like a look out of a picture
window. Any object which is in the center of the cross hairs is in the
same location as the player.
.PP
At most any time in a game, a players status is changing. Although
many of the players resources will be changing, the current value
of them will be displayed only on command. Therefore, a player must
always keep a mental note of his status, as the readings on the screen
only reflect the last time they were asked for. An exception to this
rule is the players position, which is so important it is always kept
current.
Below the players position, is the players energy display. To display
your current energy, type "e". As was stated above, if a players
energy goes to zero, they leave the game, by force. The manipulation
of energy will be described shortly.
.PP
Below the energy display is the homing radar display. Each ship has
three channels of homing radar, which may be used however the player
sees fit. Homing radar is important in that an object locked on
a homing radar channel can be "autopiloted" to.
.PP
Below the homing radar display is the points display. The "p" command
will display the players current point total.
.PP
Coming down the left hand side of the view screen are several more
displays. The first display is the Invisibility display. A player
may control his invisibility with the "i" command. When a player
is invisible, he cannot be seen by other players, or autopiloted
upon. Invisibility, like everything else, costs energy, one
unit per iteration.
.PP
Below Invisibility is the Velocity display. A player may have a
velocity in either the X or Y direction. The velocity can be
either a plus or minus number. The "v" command displays the current
velocity. This command is used most often to indicate to a player
how to maneuver his velocity to 0.
.PP
Below Velocity is the Time display. The current time is displayed
with the "c" (for clock) command. Each unit of time is called
an iteration, and is defined to be the the time it takes to
move all the objects in the universe, and display the positions to
all of the players. The more the players, the less the number of
iterations per any unit of real time. With one player on an unloaded
system, the game will iterate about 20 times a second. Eight players
on a loaded system may have only 1 iteration per second.
.PP
The final display along the left side of the view screen is the M-Factor
display. A player may vary the magnification factor of his view screen,
to see more of the universe. Normal M-Factor is 1, but it can go to
2 or 3. A player is urged to use caution when using M-Factors other
than 1, as they are very costly.
.PP
Below the view screen are two lines labeled "STATUS" and "MESSAGE".
Various messages from inside the players ship, and other players,
appear on these lines.
.PP
MOVEMENT: The keypad on the right side of a terminal is used to
control movement. On the screen, the positive X direction goes
toward the right, and the positive Y direction goes down. Hitting
a key causes movement in the direction the key is positioned in,
relative to the keypad. For example, hitting a "6" causes added
movement in the plus X direction. A "7" reduces movement in both the
X and Y direction. Each hit of a key increases a players velocity
in the specified direction. To slowdown, the "reverse" velocity keys
must be pressed. For example, if a "2" is hit when a player is
standing still, he will be begin traveling in the plus Y direction,
one unit per iteration. Hitting an "8" will return the player to
zero velocity, and hitting another "2" will move the velocity
to 2, in the plus Y direction.
.PP
ENERGY EXPENDITURE: As running out of energy removes a player
from the game, it is very important to know how it is
manipulated. Energy is only displayed when asked for, with the "e"
command. Energy begins at 250. Certain events cause a player to
lose the ability to hold energy, and they will be detailed later.
Here is an informal list of "energy changers".
.br
Shooting a torpedo costs 10 energy units.
.br
Being invisible costs 1 energy unit per iteration.
.br
0 velocity in both directions causes a player to GAIN one unit
of energy per iteration.
.br
An absolute velocity of 1 in either direction neither gains nor
loses energy.
.br
An absolute velocity of greater than 1 in either direction costs
1 energy unit per turn.
.br
Being hit with space shrapnel, from the explosion of a dead ship  costs
20 energy units.
.br
Each nuke modification at quartone costs 20 energy units.
.br
A Magnification Factor that is greater than 1 costs energy (see below).
.PP
If one considers the combination of several of the above rules, the
following types of results can be found.
.br
Invisibility on with no movement does not change a players energy.
.br
Moving quickly with invisibility on and a high maginification factor
is close to suicide!
.PP
Being hit with a torpedo not only costs 50 energy units, but also
reduces a players capacity to hold energy by 50 units. This means
that if a player has an energy of 250 and is hit by a torpedo,
he will have an energy of 200, and cannot ever again go above 200,
unless repairs are made at a starbase. Starbases will be explained
later. The X-aliens also effect a players capacity to hold energy.
If an X-alien moves across your current location (a collision), your
capacity to hold energy is decreased by 15.
Finally, space shrapnel also reduces a players capacity to hold energy.
.PP
WEAPONS: A player has two types of weapons, useful against other
players, and aliens. The most general is a torpedo, which can
hit either a player or an alien. A torpedo is fired by hitting the "t"
key followed by a firing direction which is entered from the keypad.
For example, the sequence "t2" will shoot a torpedo from your current
position
in a direction with a minus Y value. A torpedo is fired by
giving it the same current position and velocity as the firing player,
and adding to that the velocity addition indicated by the keypad
direction.
A nuke is similar to a torpedo, but is more powerful.
The second type of weapon is the "phaser", which is
only used against aliens. To fire a phaser, a player must be
directly on top of an alien, and then hit the "0" key. Firing
a phaser costs no energy. When an alien is hit with either a torpedo
or phaser, it moves in a new direction.
.PP
POINTS: Hitting another player obtains 50 points for the shooter.
Hitting yourself with a torpedo (self hit) COSTS 75 points.
Running into the planet "Quartone" not only costs 50 points, but
also removes a player from the game. Phasering an alien obtains
4 points. A torpedo hit on a normal alien obtains 6 points, an X
alien 20 points, and a shanker 20 points.
.PP
SHANKERS: Shankers are aliens that can fire back!!! Some of the
aliens in the universe start out looking like a normal "#" alien, but
are really shankers. When a shanker is first hit with a torpedo, he
removes the "#" disguise and turns into a "@", the true shanker
colors. A shanker remembers who hit him, and when the opportunity
arises shoots at his enemy. A shanker will remain mad at a player
until it gets one hit on him, and then the shanker will start
roaming around, until next attacked. A shanker torpedo hit reduces
a players capacity to hold energy by 50, so they should not be
taken lightly.
.PP
QUARTONE: Quartone is a planet which is located "around" -30, -30 (X,Y).
As all objects receive a random start in the game, these coordinates
are only approximate. Quartone has several unusual properties.
Running into Quartone costs 50 points, and causes removal from the game.
If a player is right next to Quartone, and is going slow enough, they
may orbit Quartone, with the "o" command.
A player orbiting Quartone may not be hit with a torpedo
from another player. 
This is because the orbit command actually takes the player into a
low orbit over the planets surface, where torpedos are burned up
by atmospheric friction.
It may appear as if torpedos go through Quartone, but they are
really going "behind" it!
Torpedos shot by
shankers, however, can hit Quartone (and players in orbit around it)
as they are made out of Krell metal, the hardest substance in the Universe.
.PP
It is possible to exploit the people on quartone. The procedure is explained
in the "Nuke" section.
.PP 
STARBASES: There are three starbases in each SEARCH game. Two are
located somewhere in the first quadrant (+X,+Y), and one is
located a little -X,-Y of Quartone. When a player has a 
starbase directly in the middle of his crosshairs, he may dock,
with the "d" command. Each dock, will increase a players capacity
to hold energy by 25, up to the limit of 250. A players energy
will also be made equal to his max energy. Although starbases sound
like nice places to sit on, a player should be careful - torpedos
can hit players at starbases, and there is usually always an invisible
player or two waiting to shoot through a nearby base.
.PP
AUTOPILOT: As mentioned above, a player has three channels of
homing radar, which are used in conjunction with the autopilot.
When an object is directly in the middle of a players crosshairs, the
player has the oportunity to "lock onto" that object, using the "s" set
command. "s" sets a user specified channel number to that object.
The valid set commands are therefore "s1", "s2", or "s3". Once an
object is locked onto, its current coordinates may be found by
using the "h" command, in conjunction with the corresponding channel
number, such as "h2". Stationary objects, such as a starbase, will
always have the same coordinates, but moving objects, such as aliens
or other players will probably show a different coordinate value,
each time the "h" command is executed. To autopilot on a set object,
enter the "a" command, followed by the channel number desired.
Autopilot moves you toward the target with a maximum velocity of 2
in either direction. Autopilot costs no energy, and is therefore
an easy way to travel. When the target is reached, the autopilot
will turn off and signal the player with a beep. When following
a moving object, the autopilot will keep up with the target, as long at the
target goes no faster than 2 in either direction. Once a channel
is set, it may be reused by setting over the previous target.
.PP
SOLAR FLARES: When a player turns on his "invisibility", what he is really
doing is ionizing his ships hull with random space vacuum particles (RSVP).
This ionization makes the ship "blend" in with the normal space void, on
other players view screens. When an occasional solar flare occurs, the
delicate ionic potential balance is upset, and players lose their ability 
to become invisible for the duration of the flare. When a flare occurs,
each player will be informed by a message, and their invisibility will
go off. Solar flares have a random duration, and there is no warning of
when the flare ends.
.PP
SHRAPNEL: Each ship is powered by trans-diclorobisethlyenediameme cobalt
chloride III crystals. When a player is dealt a fatal torpedo hit, there
is always the chance that the crystals will be hit. When these crystals
are hit, then explode, sending deadly shrapnel out from the dead ship.
If a player is hit by a piece of shrapnel, they must lose 20 energy units
to effect repairs, and, the ionic imbalance of the crystals will cause
their invisibility to go off.
.PP
TEAM PLAYING: Several commands have been added to the game which allow
for a form of team playing.
As explaned above, the representation of the universe on the view screen
is accomplished by measuring the Ionic Mass Forces (IMF) between objects.
It is also possible to send out coded radio beacons which can be used
to locate and "see" objects. Detection of ships by radio is possible
under all conditions, providing a player wishes to send the coded beacon.
Assuming several players enable each to see the other, they may remain
invisible to the rest of the universe, and work as a unit. Four commands
deal directly with team playing, j,q,l, and g.
.PP
The "j" command lets you select who may see you, all of the time. After
the "j" is a list of lower case player letters. The command is terminated
with a newline, don't forget it. The "q" command lets you remove players
from the list of those who can see you at all times. Usage is similar to "j",
except that "q." removes all players. You may learn who you enabled to
see you with the "l" command. Finally, the "g" command send a message
to the members of your group. It is used just like the "b" command.
When viewing a player who is invisible, but sending you a radio beacon,
they will appear as lower case letters.
.PP
NUKES: A weapon similar to torpedoes is the nuke. The command is similar
in format to torpedoes. To launch a nuke, a players ship must be
modified. Cheap labor is usually found on the surface of quartone, and
modifications to allow nukes can be made there. To modify your ship,
you must enter the orbit of quartone, and have your invisibility off.
The "x" command (exploit) will tell the people on the planet to work
on your ship. As a result of poor working conditions, each modification
results in some worker death. Each modification allows one nuke to be
stored. Usually only 10 - 12 modifications can be done at any one
visit to quartone. Be warned that excesive carnage can lead to the
generation of powerful foes.
.PP
COMMAND SUMMARY: No attempt will be made to outline or detail
possible tactics or approaches to the game. A list of the most
used commands will be presented next, along with a short explanation.
All input to search should be done in lower case, and using
upper case, especially on an ADDS terminal will surely lead to trouble.
.PP
"w" - who is in the game.
.PP
"v" - current velocity.
.PP
"e" - current energy.
.PP
"d" - dock.
.PP
"s" - set homing radar channel (1,2, or 3).
.PP
"h" - display homing radar channel (1,2 or 3).
.PP
"a" - autopilot to channel (1,2 or 3).
.PP
"@" - redraw screen.
.PP
"t" - fire torpedo.
.PP
"0" - fire phasers.
.PP
"c" - time.
.PP
"f" - facts. display in game player hits, kills, and level.
.PP
"o" - orbit. (Quartone)
.PP
"b" - broadcast message. b, then message, then newline.
.PP
"r" - radio message, like "b", but only to one person. r, then terminal
letter, then message, then newline.
.PP
1,2,3,4,6,7,8,9 - directions to move.
.PP
"m" - magnification factor (1,2 or 3).
.PP
"control 'c'" - exit game.
.PP
"i" - invisibility.
.PP

case is "q.", which removes all.
.PP
"l" - look at your group.
.PP
"g" - broadcast message to your group.
.PP
"n" - fire nuke.
.PP

.PP
MISC: To try and obtain a comparative skill rating between players,
"search accounting" was implemented.
Certain pieces of information are kept about each players status.
These pieces are:
.br
Total interations.
.br
Torpedo hits on aliens.
.br
Torpedo hits on other players.
.br
Kills of other players.
.PP
This information is maintained for all time a player is in the game.
The information is obtained by executing:
.br
/nmpc/usr/ordy/bin/sa
.br
A "level" number is derived from the accumulated statistics. The
formula for calculating level is:
.br
level = ( (points*100) + (hits*100) + (kills*1000)) / time
.br
The "f" command gives a players level, within the game.
.PP
Occasionally, Search dies in the middle of a game. When this happens,
all of the players terminals are locked up. To clear up this
situation, execute:
.br
/nmpc/usr/ordy/bin/sclean
.br
This program will return all terminals to their normal state.
There should only be one game going on at a time. If two players start
a game at almost the same instant, however, two games may be created.
In this case, characters typed on the terminal may go to either of the
two games, producing "unwanted" results. The two game situation can be
diagnosed by the occurance of two "players:" prompts. If this happens,
let both games start, and then enter several control C's, to kill them all.
.PP
Any comments should be directed to G. Ordy, Crawfordious Hall.
