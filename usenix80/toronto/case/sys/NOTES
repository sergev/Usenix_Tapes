In an attempt to add some insight into why we have done certain
things to our kernel, I would like to describe our hardware
configuration.  We run on a PDP-11/34 with 124KW of memory,
no floating point, 5 RK05's (0/1 is an RK05f fixed cartridge
disk, 2 is an RK05j, and 3 and 4 are Diablo model 30's), 2 DZ-11's
(16 lines, all local hardwired terminals running at 9600 baud),
and 3 DL-11E's (2 line printers and 1 misc.).

At least, that was our configuration until a week ago, we just got
an 11/45 and are waiting for some faster memory.  Most everything
we've done has been driven by the constraints of the 11/34.

We also have a smaller 11/34 system with floating point, and an 11/40
system connect to an LDS-2 real-time shaded graphics pipeline.
