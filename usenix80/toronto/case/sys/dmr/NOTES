This directory contains out versions of the standard
Unix device drivers.  Some have also come from other
places, like the University of Illinois.

ar.c	AR-11 Analog/Digital interface device driver.
	Has never been tested.

bio.c	Changes involve mostly bug fixes from all over.

dd.c	Diablo model 40 disk with System Industries model 3047
	controller device driver.  See the comments there.

dh.c	DH-11 driver from U. of Ill., slightly modified.

dj.c	DJ-11 driver.  Much cleaned up version of someone
	else's driver.

dz.c	DZ-11 driver.  Handles more than one DZ.  Code for silo
	has been working for a few days and seems ok.

kl.c	DL-11 driver.  Code for modems mostly works but suspect
	there are hidden bugs.  Addresses now specified external
	to driver, in conf/ttyc.c, we changed them too much.

lc.c	Line printer interfaced through DC-11.

lds.c	LDS-2 graphics system pipeline driver.  Very little testing
	has been done.  Nobody else has one anyway.

ll.c	Line printer interfaced through DL-11.

lx.c	Like ll.c, but tries to know about specific printers
	and other smart things.  Handles stty/gtty.

pty.c	Pseudo-ttys from U. of Ill.

rk.c	RK05 driver.  No more interleaved junk.

rx.c	RX01 floppy disk device driver.

rx2.c	RX02 floppy disk device driver.  Has raw I/O interface
	and format capability.  Can even be used for swap and
	root, we've done it!

tty.c	Many changes here for input character processing.  Knows about
	DEC stuff like ^C, ^S, ^Q, ^O, ^U, and rubout for crt's.
	8 bit raw I/O.
