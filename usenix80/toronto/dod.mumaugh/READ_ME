This file contains:

1. A description of every other file on the tape.

2. Instructions on how to use this graphics package.

Files:

READ_ME         This file
pr.sh           Prints documentation and sources
genisco.c       Genisco device driver
init_termin.c   functions for initializing and terminating
user_program.c  sample user program
defaults.c      functions for setting and inquiring default values
inquiry.c       inquiry functions
seg_attrib.c    segment attribute handling functions
segments.c      segment handling functions
primitives.c    output primitives handling functions
prim_attrib.c   output primitives attributes handling functions
view_trans.c    functions for viewing transformations
view_surface.c  functions for handling output devices
auxiliary.c     general system service functions
errors.c        error handling functions
???????.c       the function having the name "???????"
run             shell file to compile all .c files  and load library
run-example     shell file to load example
batch.c         batching functions
(pseudodisplay) pseudo dislay file which will be created


Instructions for use:

1. For some device, write a device driver according to the
specifications in the documentation. A sample driver for the
Genisco raster display is in file genisco.

2. Substitute the name of the file containing your driver for
genisco in the run shell file. Also, edit the device
characteristics for the device into the view surface descriptor
in file init_termin.c.

3. Write a user_program that does something useful or use the
sample provided. See the run-example for details.

4. Submit run-example files to UNIX shell. This will create file
"example" which should execute.

5. When things go wrong (and they will), we'd be interested in
hearing about it, but we probably won't do anything about it.
Submit all complaints (in writing, not by phone) with the
accompaning fix (sources on tape, if necessary) to:
