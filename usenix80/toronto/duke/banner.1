.sh NAME
banner \*- block lettering for banners
.sh SYNOPSIS
.bd banner
[ \fB\*-c\fIc\fR ] [ \fB\*-w\fIn\fR ] [ \fBtext\fR ]
.sh DESCRIPTION
The text, if present,
is printed on the standard output converted to
seven-by-seven block letters.
Each separate string of input text is
output as one line.
.s1
The \fB\*-c\fR option allows selection of the character to be used
in building the expanded letters.
The default character is "*".
If no character is given,
the letters are built of the character being expanded, thus,
.sp
.ti +8
banner -c a
.sp
would produce a large `a' made up of small `a's.
.s1
The `\fB\*-w\fR' option allows the user to specify
the size of the line generated,
where \fB\fIn\fR is in terms of
print positions.
The default value of 80 generates
a maximum of
10 bannered characters per line.
If text would overflow the limit, it is not generated.
.s1
If no text is presented in the argument list
banner reads the standard input
as a source of text.
This text is expanded to one output line per input line.
.sp
Try banner "*" | banner.
