.sh NAME
extract - GMS dump tape extraction
.sh SYNOPSIS
.bd extract
tapedrive
.bd [-d]
.bd [-n]
.bd [-t
directory] file
.sh DESCRIPTION
.it Extract
is the GMS dump tape extraction program.  The standard dump tape of a file
system consists of an ncheck of that file system followed by the actual data.
.it Extract
is able to extract individual files from this tape.  It can also
do a raw dump of the ncheck, the data, or both.  In all cases, the output
goes to standard output.
.s3
.it Tapedrive
is the number of the drive the tape is mounted on.  For instance,
tape drive 2 refers to the device /dev/rmt2.
.s3
.it File
is the name of the file to be extracted.  One and only one file may
be extracted at a time.  The
.it -d
and
.it -n
flags cause
.it file
to be ignored.
If a number is specified instead of a pathname, it is assumed to be
the inode number of the file to be extracted.
.s3
The following flags are interpreted by
.it extract:
.s3
.lp +6 5
-d	Dump the data portion of the tape onto the standard output.
.s3
.lp +6 5
-n	Dump the ncheck portion of the tape onto the standard output.
The ncheck will be null padded to fill out a full record.
.s3
.lp +6 5
-t	The next argument is taken to be the name of a directory
in which to create temporary files.  If this flag is not used, the
temporary files will be created in /tmp.
.i0
.dt
.s3
The
.it -d
and
.it -n
flags may be used together.  In this case, the ncheck will be output
before the data.  This is equivalent to a complete dump of the tape.
.sh FILES
/usr/adm/dump/*	shell files which create the tapes
.br
stm???			temporary files used by FSORT(X)
.br
(pid).(seed)		temporary files
.sh "SEE ALSO"
dd (I), ncheck (VIII), gmsdump (VIII)
.sh DIAGNOSTICS
When doing an extract with the -d flag, extract has no way of telling
how much to read.  It just reads to end of file.  Unfortunately, on
raw magtape, end of file looks like an i/o error.  Therefore, extract
will say it had an i/o error when it reaches end of file.  In this case
the record count should be checked to determine if it completed
successfully.  Note also that the -d and -n flags are implemented
using DD(I).
