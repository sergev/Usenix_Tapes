.sh DESCRIPTION
.it Fsort
is an implementation of the quicker-sort algorithm which works on files.
It calls QSORT(III) to do the actual sorting.  The advantage of
.it fsort
is that it can sort much larger amounts of data than QSORT(III) can.
.s3
.it Fsort
is part of the GMS library (-lg flag to CC(I) or LD(I)).  Also, it depends
on routines in the standard i/o library (-lS flag to CC(I) or LD(I)).
Thus to load
.it fsort
successfully, the -lg flag must be followed by the -lS flag as in:
.s3
cc -n -O prog.c -lS -lg -lS -o prog
.s3
(the first -lS in the example is only needed if you are using other
features of the Standard I/O Library, such as printf).
.it File
is a pointer to the name of the file to be sorted.
.it Width
is the width of a record (in bytes).
.it Compar
is the name of the comparison routine.
.s3
The comparison routine is called with two arguments which are pointers
to the records being compared.
The routine must return
an integer less than, equal to, or greater than 0
according as the first argument is to be considered
less than, equal to, or greater than the second.
.s3
.it Fsortdir
is a pointer to a directory name in which temporary files are created.
Initially it is set to "/tmp", but the caller may change this
at any time by assigning a new pathname to
.it fsortdir.
.sh FILES
stm???		temporary files (created in /tmp by default)
.sh DIAGNOSTICS
Returns 0 if successful, -1 on any error.
