.sh NAME
gmsdump - create a GMS dump tape
.sh SYNOPSIS
.bd dump disk tape
.sh DESCRIPTION
.it Gmsdump
is a group of programs which create GMS format dump tapes.
Files may be extracted from these dump tapes using the
program
.it extract.
The
.it gmsdump
programs create a dump of a file system which consist of
an
.it ncheck
of the file system followed by a dump of all the data in the file
system.  The tape is written in 33 block records and the last ncheck
record is null padded.
.s3
The exact procedure for creating a dump of a file system is as follows.
Mount a tape on any available tape drive.  Change the current working
directory to
.it /usr/adm/dump.
Execute the program
.it dump.
.it Dump
takes 2 arguments.  The first argument is the number of the disk
you wish to dump (for example /dev/rdp11 would be specified as 11).
The second argument is the number of the tape drive the tape is
mounted on (for example /dev/rmt0 would be specified as 0).  The
program will ask you several questions which should be
self-explanatory.  After the questions have been answered, the
program
.it dodump
is called by
.it dump
to create the dump tape.
.it Dodump
first runs an
.it ncheck
on the specified disk and writes it onto the tape (the last record
is padded to 33 blocks).  It then runs
.it dd
to copy the data on the disk to the tape.  Upon completion,
.it dd
will print out the number of blocks copied.  The entire procedure
takes about 5 minutes for small disks and 10 minutes for large ones.
