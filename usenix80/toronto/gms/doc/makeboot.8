.th MAKEBOOT VIII 2/1/79
.sh NAME
makeboot - create selfbooting UNIX tape
.sh SYNOPSIS
.bd /usr/adm/boot/makeboot
.sh DESCRIPTION
.it Makeboot
is the program which creates a selfbooting UNIX tape.
The tape thus created can be used
to bring up a working operating system in the event
that it is impossible to boot from the disk.
The program copies a special bootstrap program, a root file system,
and an operating system from the disk to the tape.
.s3
The exact procedure for creating the selfbooting tape is as follows.
Mount a tape on drive 0.  Type the command
.it /usr/adm/boot/makeboot.
At this point, the tape should spin and and the lights on the disk drive
should flash.  Finally, the tape should rewind and the program 
terminate.  Any errors during the creation of the tape will
cause a diagnostic to be printed and the program to terminate.
Termination of the program with no diagnostic means successful
creation of the selfbooting tape.  The program takes about
5 minutes to run.
.s3
Some notes of caution for creating the selfbooting UNIX tape.
First of all, the system should be quiet when the tape is made.
Second, the root file system copied should be 5500 blocks long.
Third, there should be a UNIX disk bootstrap program in block 0
of the root file system copied.  Fourth, the operating system
copied should use a 5500 block file system starting at block
0 on disk drive 0 as its root.  Finally, the tape should be
created at 800 BPI.
.s3
If the above precautions are not followed, the selfbooting tape
will not work correctly.  The actual files and special devices
currently used by the program are listed below.
