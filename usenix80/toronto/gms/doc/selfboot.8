.th SELFBOOT VIII 2/1/79
.sh NAME
selfboot - bootstrap program for the selfbooting UNIX tape
.sh SYNOPSIS
.bd /usr/adm/boot/selfboot
.sh DESCRIPTION
.it Selfboot
is the bootstrap program for the selfbooting UNIX tape.  It is never
executed directly.  Instead, it is written onto the selfbooting
tape by the program
.it makeboot.
When the selfbooting tape is used, this bootstrap
program is read from the tape into core and executed.
.s3
The program copies a root file system from the selfbooting tape
onto the disk on drive 0 starting at block 0.
Upon completion of this operation,
an operating system is read from the tape into core.
This operating system is then executed.
.s3
The exact procedure for using the selfbooting tape created by
.it makeboot
is as follows.
Mount the selfbooting tape on drive 0.  Boot the 11/34.  Type
MT in answer to the prompt instead of the usual DB.  At this
point, the tape should spin and the lights on disk drive 0
should flash.  Finally, the tape should rewind and UNIX should come up.
The program takes about 5 minutes to run.
Be sure to set the console switch register to 000112 beforehand
so that the system comes up single user.
