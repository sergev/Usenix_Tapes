.sh DESCRIPTION
The tape i/o library works similarly to the standard i/o library.
There is an include file for the library.  Each program that wants
to use the library should contain the line:
.s3
#include <tapio.h>
.s3
near the front of the file.
.s3
The tape i/o library is separate from all other libraries.  To load this
library use the -lt switch to CC(I) or LD(I) as in:
.s3
% cc -n -O file.c -lt -o file
.s3
In the descriptions that follow, reference is made to some defines
found in the include file.
.s3
.it TAPE
expands to struct _tapio which is the internal structure used
by the library for handling tape i/o.
.s3
.it NULL
is 0 which is the error return for pointer-valued functions.
.s3
.it OK
is 0 which is the non-error return for functions which do not return
specific values.
.s3
.it ERR
is -1 which is the error return for all non-pointer-valued functions.
.s3
.it Topen
attempts to open the file
.it tapdev
(presumably a raw magtape device)
for reading.
The tape is rewound if necessary.
.it Recsiz
specifies the maximum size of a record
on that tape and is used to set the size of the input buffer.
It returns
a pointer to the _tapio structure for the tape or NULL on an error.
.s3
.it Tgetc
attempts to read the next character from the tape specified by
.it tp.
It returns an integer representing
the character (no sign extension) or ERR on an error.
.s3
.it Tclose
attempts to close the tape and free the buffer specified by
.it tp.
It also causes the tape to be rewound.
It returns OK if successful
or ERR on an error.
.s3
.it Tread
reads
.it cnt
objects of size
.it siz
from the tape specified by 
.it tp.
There is no error indication.  The number of
objects actually read is returned.
.s3
.it Tseek
attempts to seek to the position
.it offset
(in bytes) on the tape
specified by
.it tp.
It returns OK if
successful or ERR on an error.  Note that only forward seeks are allowed.
In order to seek backward, first call
.it tclose
to close the and rewind the tape.
Then just reopen it with
.it topen
and call
.it tseek
to reach the correct position.
.s3
.it Ttell
returns the current position (in bytes) on the tape specified by
.it tp.
It returns ERR on an error.

.sh DIAGNOSTICS
Return codes as explained in the description above.
.sh BUGS
None, but there is room for expansion.
