.sh NAME
decl -- output optimizer for DECwriters(r)
.sh SYNOPSIS
decl [-eom] [file]
.sh DESCRIPTION
decl is an output optimizer for DECwriters or other terminals with
working backspaces and linefeeds.  It attempts to find the
optimal order to output the characters in a line.  This can mean
a significant savings of time for some types of files.
.s3
If no input file is specified, standard input is used.
decl can thus be used as a filter.
If standard output is a teletype, decl will remove write
permission from it and restore it when done (like PR(I)).
The three options are:
.s3
.lp +4 4
-e	do not eject the last page when done
.s3
.lp +4 4
-o	middle of the line optimization
.s3
.lp +4 4
-m	supress the statistics message. (It is normally
put onto the error log.)
