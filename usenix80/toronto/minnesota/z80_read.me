AFTER THE DOCUMENTATION WAS PRINTED WE DISCOVERED THAT A FARLY LARGE NUMBER
OF PEOPLE HAVE BIOS'S LARGER THAN THE STANDARD 512 BYTES.  IF YOU DO...

MSIZE = SIZE OF MEMORY IN KBYTES AS USUAL.
BIOSSZ = SIZE OF BIOS IN BYTES.  BIOSSZ MUST BE A MULTIPLE OF 256.

    THE ONLY THING AFFECTED IS IS PUTTING A BOOTER ONTO A PASCAL DISK.
THE STEPS TO BE FOLLOWED ARE:

1.  COMPUTE LOADP := MSIZE*1024-BIOSSZ-1024;
    BIOSORG := MSIZE*1024-BIOSSZ

2.  WRITE THE PROGRAM PBOOT AND ASSEMBLE IT.
    PBOOT MUST LOAD SECTORS 2 THRU  9 + BIOSSZ/128 
    IT MUST LOAD THEM STARTING AT LOCATION
    LOADP, AND THEN JUMP TO LOADP.

3.  CHANGE MSIZE AND BIOSSZ IN  PINIT AND ASSEMBLE.

4.  CHANGE BIOSSZ IN PGEN AND REASSEMBLE, THEN LOAD.

5.  STITCH TOGETHER THE PIECES
    A) TO FIND THE OFFSET PINIT.HEX SHOULD BE READ IN WITH, USE
       LOADP RATHER THAN BA00.
    B) TO FIND THE OFFSET BIOS.HEX SHOULD BE READ IN WITH, USE
       BIOSORG RATHER THAN BE00.
    C) SAVE  14 + BIOSSZ/256 RATHER THAN 16 WHEN SAVING
