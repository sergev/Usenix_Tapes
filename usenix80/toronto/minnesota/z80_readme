

Bringing UCSD Pascal up for the first time
------------------------------------------



	To bring up Pascal first assure yourself that you have a standard
BIOS area (i.e.  all i/o vectors are in order) and that the warm boot
vector is in place.  Next if you have a single drive system, make sure that
your BIOS ignors all requests to drive B.  Two drive systems will require
diskettes in both drives until you modify your disk drivers to return a
not ready condition (i.e. a 1 in the A register) when the drive has no diskettee.
Now bring up your standard system, and run the program PASCAL.COM supplied
on the 8080/Z80 support diskette.  This program will prompt you with a request
for a Pascal system diskette in dirve A.  At that time insert the UCSD
distribution Pascal diskette and if you have a second dirve place
any initialized diskette in that drive as well.  Type return and enter the
world of pascal.
