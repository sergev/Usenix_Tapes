     This program is a simulation of the card game Gin  with
the  program  and  the  human  invoker  playing against each
other.  Only games won and lost are noted, unlike the  usual
method  of keeping a running total of points from each hand.
For this reason, and because the author dislikes the notion,
"knocking"  is  not  allowed.  A response of "l" (el) at any
time will print the humans hand.  This was the authors first
C  program, written, debugged and rewritten over a period of
about one year.  One might excuse the lack  of  elegance  in
the  code  for this reason.  The shuffle routine was adapted
from an algorithm in  Creative  Computing.   The  evaluation
algorithm was designed by the author and Michael O'Dell.
