Greetings.
This tape contains the rm03 driver which started life
an an rp04 driver at Purdue.  I modified it and it has
been running now for several months without problems.
If one really wishes to get picky, all the error recovery
is not as it really should be, but zemzabreaks.
If you get industrious and do anything else to it
(like put in ecc, improve error recovery, etc) I should
like to borrow back a copy.  
hm.c is for rm03/rh70 in normal (rp04) addresses.
hn.c is for second rm03/rh70 at oddball address. CHECK THIS CAREFULLY.

Things to look out for:
George Goble's (Purdue) kernel has lots of stuff in it for
powerfail recovery, statistics gathering, etc.  Almost
everything is put in with #defines and will disappear all
by themselves.  The only real zinger is a function,
currently living in m45.s, which allows a driver to halt
the system dead.  (You guessed it, it is called halt().)
It is only called when the driver thinks that things are
completely unrecoverable (ie, hard i/o error).
In his kernel, to attempt to recover (meaning try the
error recovery stuff again) one simply "continues" on the
front panel.  If you want, add such a function.  If not,
do whatever strikes your fancy.

Also, the tables describing the virtual disks are now in 
rm03.layout.  This insures that both copies change together
(assuming I can remember to recompile both of them).
I use hm15 for deadstart device, hm6 for root with last 45 cylinders
of hm6 for swap; hm0 and hm10 are  user file systems;
hm11 is staff/system file system. Normally /tmp gets mounted
on my other drive (hn12) and I sometimes put swap on the last
45 cylinders with /tmp.  hn1 currently contains an old root,
hn7 is a 65535 block filesystem full of sources, and hn0
is a file system for research users (lots of disk).
This way, if an rm03 dies, by swapping pakcks and possibly
a cable change, I can run in a degraded mode with only /src
unavailable and the research users out in the cold.
