The things owned by bin constitute the Arbitrary Length Arithmetic
routines.
The rest can be used as an example of an inode lock on UNIX.

The inode lock/release routines provide either a subscriber lock, or
a forces system lock.  The code provided is the basic lock/release
routine.  In order to use it you will have to examine how it works
and adapt
it to your own system.  Some fiddling is necessary in the proc
structure, the sysent table, and write handler.
The locking is basicaly accomplished by keeping a linked list
in the proc structure of the procs locked inodes.
Comments in xlr.c describe how various lock-out situations are
handled.
