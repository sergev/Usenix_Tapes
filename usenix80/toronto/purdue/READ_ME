If this tape is written in cpio format, do the following to extract it.
You need about 10000 blocks of space.

# chdir to-directory-where-you-want-to-load-this-tape
# cpio -id </dev/mt0

If this is a tp format tape, then you have to extract it in 2
parts.  There are 2 files on the tape, each a tp image.
The first tp image contains directories apl, xasm, doc,
Mel.Ferentz, and the READ_ME files.

The second tp image contains src, sys, usr, and usr2 dirs.
This is necessary since a tp image can only hold 496 files.
It takes much less time to make 2 tp images than archiving
everything up.

To do a tp extract:

% tp xm0 MAKE-TP-DIRS
% sh MAKE-TP-DIRS
% tp xm0

Next do whatever local magic is necessary to position the
tape at the end of the first file mark.

% tp xm0

Our system files live in  "/usr2/sys/*",  but  are  in  directory
"sys" on this tape.  Sources are in "/src", but are "src" on this
tape. Help files and other documentation live in "/usr2/news" and
are  in  "doc"  on  the  tape.   "apl" is Purdue's version of Ken
Thompson's  apl,  "xasm"  contains  Peter   Hallenbeck's   cross-
assemblers  for  6800's  and  8080's  and some graphics (circuit-
drawing programs)  which  let  one  draw  schematics,  etc  on  a
textronix 4014 and plot them on an HP 7221A plotter.  The circuit
drawing/plotting stuff is still in development.

Sources for network servers, etc is in src/mx/*.

See also "READ_ME" files in sys and xasm for more info.

See src/mx/* for network software and documentation.

    We do not have a "distribution" service as other places do, but
will give out a copy of parts of our system (provided nobody's license
agreement gets infringed upon) for those sending us a tape.  Things
are not in a neat distribution form, just copies of working directories.
