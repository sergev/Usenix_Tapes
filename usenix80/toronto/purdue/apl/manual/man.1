What are all of those funny characters?
.PP
Part of the power of \s-2APL\s0
comes from the fact that it
has so many primitive
operators,
usually referred to as
"functions" in \s-2APL\s0 literature.
That is,
many common functions,
from addition and subtraction,
to trigonometric functions,
and to matrix operations,
can be specified with a couple
of characters.
As a result,
the character set for
\s-2APL\s0 does look a little strange.
Basically,
there are two major types of
primitive functions.
The most common functions,
such as the arithmetic operators,
etc.,
are represented by a single
character.
For example,
the symbol "+"
represents addition.
Because there are only so
many keys on the keyboard,
the other operators
in \s-2APL\s0,
for example matrix inversion,
are called "overstrike"
characters.
As we discussed in the last
section,
an overstrike character is treated
as one symbol by \s-2APL\s0
but requires three keystrokes
on the terminal.
One common example is the
"comment" symbol.
This symbol is composed of
the three characters:
C <backspace> J.
(This is also the same thing
as J <backspace> C).
.PP
On an ASCII terminal,
an overstrike character is
typed by typing:
.sp
<first char> <control-H> <second-char>
.sp
As we discussed earlier,
if you use an ASCII terminal
you must have previously typed
the command:
.sp
% stty erase X
.sp
(where "X" is some character such as "_")
in order for the control-H to
work properly in \s-2APL\s0.
Note that because of the way the ASCII
terminals work,
when you type the second character on
top of the first,
the terminal will only display the
second character.
.PP
On an \s-2APL\s0 terminal,
you may type an overstrike
character in one of two ways.
You may type:
.sp
<first character> <control-H> <second character>
.sp
just as you would on an ASCII terminal.
As with an ASCII terminal,
you must have typed an "stty"
command earlier,
and when you type the
control-H
and then type the second
character on top of the first
one,
only the second one will be displayed.
.PP
If you are using an \s-2APL\s0
terminal,
there is another way to type
overstrikes which you may find
more convenient.
In \s-2APL\s0 mode,
the key which is labelled
with "~" and "^"
(upper right end of keyboard)
is recognized by \s-2APL\s0 as a
special backspace key.
You may use this backspace
key instead of the control-H.
Thus, the sequence is:
.sp
<first character> <backspace key> <second character>
.sp
There are two advantages to using
this key instead of control-H.
The first advantage is that you
do not have to type an "stty"
command,
and you can use control-H
as the Unix erase
character to correct typing mistakes.
The second
advantage is that
when you type the backspace
and then type the second
character,
the teminal will display
a special character
representing the two
characters you typed
on top of each other.
(If you try to type
an illegal \s-2APL\s0 overstrike
symbol,
you will get a "beep"
at your terminal).
This way,
you can see both
characters you
typed instead of only
the last one.
.PP
It is not the purpose
of this manual to
attempt to describe
how to use \s-2APL\s0's many
primitive functions.
However,
they are listed
in Appendix A
for reference purposes.
