.SH
Automatic Workspace Loading
.PP
Unix \s-2APL\s0 has the nice feature that
you can automatically load a workspace file
into the internal workspace when you start \s-2APL\s0.
Instead of using the command:
.sp
% apl   <or>    % apl -m
.sp
and then loading the workspace you want
with:
.sp
	)load workspace
.sp
you can say:
.sp
% apl workspace    <or>     % apl -m workspace
.sp
\s-2APL\s0 will be started,
and will automatically look for
and load the file "workspace".
.PP
As an additional convenience,
\s-2APL\s0 will automatically load a file
named "continue" if it exists.
Thus,
if you wish to run \s-2APL\s0 and use
the file "continue" as your initial
workspace,
you need only type:
.sp
% apl   <or>    % apl -m
.sp
.PP
You may recall from the discussion
of system commands that the
")continue" command creates
a workspace named "continue".
Thus,
Unix \s-2APL\s0 provides a convenient
method of terminating
an \s-2APL\s0 session,
and restarting it later with a
minimum of effort.
You may,
for instance,
end your \s-2APL\s0 session with:
.sp
	)continue
.sp
and then resume it later by
merely starting \s-2APL\s0 with
.sp
% apl
.sp
(Recall that if you don't have
a file named "continue",
\s-2APL\s0 starts with "clear ws".)
.SH
Workspace Library
.PP
When you specify a workspace to be loaded,
\s-2APL\s0 will first look in your directory.
If it finds the workspace,
it will load it.
If not,
it will look in the library directory:
/usr/lib/apl.
Thus,
if you do not have a file named "news"
and you type:
.sp
% apl news
.sp
\s-2APL\s0 will be started,
will see that you don't have
a "news" file,
and will print:
.sp
[Using /usr/lib/apl/news]
.sp
Equivalently,
if you are in \s-2APL\s0 and you type:
.sp
	)load news      <or>    )copy news
.sp
you will get the library file
if you don't have a file named "news".
If the workspace you specify
does not exist in either your
directory or in /usr/lib/apl,
you will get an error message.
