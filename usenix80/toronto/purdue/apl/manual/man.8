A "startup" function in \s-2APL\s0?
.PP
\s-2APL\s0 has a startup facility
which allows automatic execution
of an \s-2APL\s0 expression when a
workspace is loaded.
If you define the variable
"Llx" to be some \s-2APL\s0 expression
and then save the workspace,
when you next ")load" the
workspace,
\s-2APL\s0 will automatically read
and execute "Llx".
For example,
if you have the function "hello"
which looks like this:
.DS
	hello
[1]     'hi there, my friend'
[2]     'welcome to apl"
.DE
and
you want \s-2APL\s0 to perform
"hello" when you load
the workspace file "hi",
you can say:
.DS L
	Llx { 'hello'
	)save hi
  14.59.31 10/26/78
	)off
.DE
Then, if you run \s-2APL\s0 with:
.sp
% apl hi
.sp
you will get:
.DS L
a p l \\\\ 1 1
25 oct 1978

  14.59.31 10/26/78 loaded hi

hi there, my friend
welcome to apl

Unix \s-2APL\s0\\11 Limitations
.PP
Unix \s-2APL\s0 does have
some limitations.
Of principal interest
to the new \s-2APL\s0 user
is that it is not
possible to take more
from an array than already
exists,
a capability which standard
\s-2APL\s0 does permit.
Other limitations
which probably
will not affect
new users include
the lack of the laminate
and dyadic format operators,
and lack of quad variables
(except for Llx).
.PP
The other major limitation for
Unix \s-2APL\s0 is space.
Despite efforts to use as
much memory as Unix permits,
only about 5000 numeric values
may be stored in an \s-2APL\s0
workspace.
In order to permit workspaces
containing more data,
there is a second version
of Unix \s-2APL\s0 called "apl2".
\s-2APL\s02 is used exactly the
same way as \s-2APL\s0 --
the only difference is that
it uses single precision
floating-point instead of
double-precision.
As a result,
some precision is lost,
but \s-2APL\s02 allows twice
as many workspace items
as \s-2APL\s0.
Although
\s-2APL\s02 and APL workspaces
are in different formats,
\s-2APL\s0 and APL2 will convert
each other's workspace files
they are loaded with ")load"
or merged with ")copy",
so workspaces may be
used interchangably.
In all other respects,
the operation of \s-2APL\s02 is
identical to the operation of \s-2APL\s0.

Conclusion
.PP
Well,
that wraps up this manual.
Reference information about
\s-2APL\s0 is found in the
on-line help system.
Type:
.sp
% help apl
.sp
and you'll get a list of
the available files.
You thus will always have
any reference information
you need at your command
as you work at your terminal.
Good luck with \s-2APL\s0!
