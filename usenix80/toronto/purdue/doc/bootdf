NAME
bootdf - display/set default system bootup filename in system boot block

SYNOPSIS
bootdf filename [ filesystem ]

DESCRIPTION
 Bootdf reads in the system bootstrap from block 0 of
 the filesystem and enters a new default name and rewrites
 the boot block.
 Default boot filename must reside in last 16 bytes, left
 justified, zero filled in the bootstrap block.

 If "filesystem" is null, default will be used. If "filename"
 is null, the name of the current default bootup file will
 be reported.  A "-" may be used as a place holder to examine
 the default boot filename on a specified filesystem.


DIAGNOSTICS
Self explanatory - mostly open or I/O errors on boot block on filesystem.

SOURCE LANGUAGE
C (/src/new/bootdf.c)

SEE ALSO
System bootstrap programs in /src/mdec/fsboot2.s

BUGS
Only works with "fsboot2" bootstrap which has builtin default bootup filename.
may corrupt other bootstraps.
