catalog -- catalog a mag tape

.sh "SYNOPSIS"
% catalog tape [-nxxx] [-s] [-e] [-7]


.sh "DESCRIPTION"
Catalog scans a mag-tape and reports the sizes and number
of each physical record.  It does this by reading each
record into a very large buffer, and noting the count
returned by the read.  It yields a report broken down
by each file on the tape, and describes the records therein.

The options are as follows:

.de x
.sp 2
.ti -8
..
.in +8
.x
-sxxx	Skip xxx files before beginning catalog.
.x
-nxxx	Process only xxx files (default is 1).
.x
-e	Ignore errors.  Otherwise any error causes termination
of the catalog.
.x
-7	Convert the record sizes from actual tape frames to 8-bit bytes,
assuming that the normal 9 to 7 track conversions were used.  (They
consist of 3, 8-bit bytes in every 4, 6-bit frames).
.x
tape	The tape to catalog may be indicated by merely the unit number
(in which case catalog uses "/dev/rmtx", where x is the supplied digit),
or by specifying any other file name.

.in -8

.sh "BUGS"
Note: cataloging a tape at the wrong density or with the wrong number
of tracks (e.g. 7 track instead of 9 track), often causes the mag tape
hardware to hang.  It is neccessary to KILL (or interrupt) the catalog
job, and then run the "unhang" program.
