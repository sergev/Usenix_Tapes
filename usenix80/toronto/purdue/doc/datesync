NAME
datesync -- synchronize date across net

SYNOPSIS
# datesync

DESCRIPTION
"datesync" allows the time at one machine to be set to  the  time
at  the other one on the net.  Typing "datesync" will synchronize
the dates.  Only super-user may change the date.

SYSTEM NOTE
"datesync" is only designed for the  current  two-machine  system
over  "csh".   When  more machines are added, it will probably be
necessary to modify it slightly.  "datesync" should be  installed
in /usr/bin mode 755.  It gets the time from the other machine by
running "datesync -d" via "csh" (when called with one argument ==
"-d",  it outputs the 4-byte system time on the standard output),
and since "csh" defaults not to uid 0 but to uid 13, it is neces-
sary that "datesync" be executable by the world.

BUGS
If the other machine's "datesync" isn't there, the error  message
produced by "csh" will be snarfed as the system time -- which may
be somewhat strange.
