     DISKTEST(VIII)                  @                  DISKTEST(VIII)



     NAME
          disktest - direct access device diagnostic


     SYNOPSIS
          disktest special-file


     DISCRIPTION
          Disktest allows any direct access  device  (and  some  sequential
          devices)  to  be  tested  while  UNIX is still available to other
          users.  Care should be taken to make the device which  is  to  be
          tested  unavailable  to  other system users.  The single required
          argument is the name of the device which is  to  be  tested  (ie.
          /dev/rk1).

          Disktest recognizes the following single character commands  some
          of  which  may be followed by numeric arguments which are assumed
          to be octal if they begin with a zero and decimal otherwise.

          h       1           0        High block number to test

          l       1           0         Low block number to test


          o       1           1         Output flag
                                              0  output on errors only

          p       1 or 2      0         Pattern flag
                                              0  default patterns
                                              1  block number is pattern
                                              2  next argument is pattern

          q       0           -         Quit - return to the shell

	  r       0           -         Execute a read, compare test

          s       1           0         Sequential access
                                              0  sequential test
                                              1  random test

          t       1           1         Test repetition factor


          w       0           -         Execute a write test

     DISKTEST(VIII)                  @                  DISKTEST(VIII)


          An interrupt (rubout) signal to disktest causes it to  print  the
          current test number, block number, and pattern  number.   A  quit
          signal  causes disktest to abort the current test and await a new
          command.  Bits transferred per error are reported on  rubout  and
          at the end of each test.  A control D will also exit
          the program.
