NAME
dlm	-  Disc accounting program

SYNOPSIS
/etc/dlm [-m | -s | -z]

DESCRIPTION
"dlm" provides the accounting for the enforcement of disk quotas.  It reads
a limit file, containing the number of disk blocks allocated to each directory
in /usr or /usr2.  Next, files containing the current usage for /usr and /usr2
are read and the actual usage is compared to the limit.  If the actual usage
is greater than the limit, a message is printed on the standard output.  If
no limit is defined for an existing directory, an error message is printed on
the standard output.

Optionally, one of the arguments "-m","-s","-z" can be included in the shell
call.  The "-m" flag causes "dlm" to attempt to maintain a file containing
the directory name, consecutive count, and cumulative count (of days in excess
of the limit) for each directory exceeding its limit.  The consecutive count
is zeroed for each directory which is not in excess for one day.  In addition
to maintaining this file, "dlm" will send a warning message to each directory
in ".mail" informing the user of his limit, current usage, and number of 
consecutive days in excess of his limit (if 2 or more).  The standard
output also contains the consecutive count if > 2 days so that the system
staff can take appropriate action.

The "-s" flag causes "dlm" to read the file containing name and excess counts
and to print a summary of directory name, consecutive days, and cumulative
days.  (The file is merely read and converted, it is not updated).

The "-z" flag is intended to be used along with the "rmall" program.  It
will reset to 0 the total count of all users with a consecutive count
> 3 days.  Since "dlm -s" only prints users with non-zero total violation
counts, this helps "clean-up" the listing.  Note that the user's name
remains in the file, and the consecutive count is not affected--thus if
he remains over the limit the next daily accounting will show the correct
number of consecutive excesses but the total will be reported as 1.  (The
consecutive count is reset to 0 when the user is no longer in excess of
his limit).

/usr2"dlm" will not create any files, but will output error messages if it cannot
/usr2open them as it needs.

/usr2/sys-usage/disk-limit -- current directory space limits
/usr2/sys-usage/usr-usage -- usage of each /usr account
/usr2/sys-usage/usr2-usage -- usage of each /usr2 account
/usr2/sys-usage/exceed -- name, exceed counts
.mail files -- system warning messages ("dlm" will not create if non-existant)

BUGS
Should always output cumulative count on standard output even if "-m" flag is
not present.
