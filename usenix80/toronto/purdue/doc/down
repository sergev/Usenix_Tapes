NAME
down -- print system down message

SYNOPSIS
/etc/down

DESCRIPTION
"down" is designed to be used with the multiple-program  versions
of  "getty",  "init",  and  "runtty".   It  looks  for  the  file
/etc/down-mesg and if it is there, prints  its  contents  on  the
terminal.  If the file does not exist, a one-line message stating
that the system is temporarily down will be printed.

After the message is printed, the program will go to sleep for 30
seconds.   During this time, it ignores interrupts and quits, but
can be killed by a hangup.  After the 30-second  pause,  it  per-
forms  a "stty" to clear out any read-ahead, and then waits for a
line of input from the terminal with  interrupts  and  quits  en-
abled.  It will terminate if:
   (1) Any line of input is typed.
   (2) An interrupt or quit is typed.
   (3) A hangup is sent to it

Since "down" locks up the terminal completely for 30 seconds,  it
is clearly not intended as a general command.  Thus, it should be
have owner bin or root and be mode 0700.
