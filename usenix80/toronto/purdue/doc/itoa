NAME
itoa - integer to ascii conversion

SYNOPSIS
char *itoa(num)
int num;

DESCRIPTION
Itoa converts a signed 16-bit integer passed as parameter into an
ascii string and returns a pointer to that string.

BUGS
Since itoa returns a pointer to a static buffer containing the
converted result, it cannot be used twice in the same expression;
the second result overwrites the first.
