NAME
     lock - lock a directory or file
     unlock - unlock a directory or file

SYNOPSIS
     lock
     unlock
     lock name
     unlock name

DESCRIPTION
     Lock and unlock are used to change the access rights of other users to
     your files and directories.  Lock prevents other users from reading or
     executing your files.  Unlock allows other users to share  your  files
     by reading or executing them.

     If called without any argument (as in the first  example),  lock  will
     "change   the   mode"   of   your  home  directory  (/usr/yourname  or
     /usr2/yourname) so that only you can get at the  files  (and  possibly
     subdirectories) within your home directory.

     If unlock is called with no argument (2nd example), your home directo-
     ry  will then be sharable by others.  If you have locked any subdirec-
     tories or files within your home directory,  they  will  still  remain
     locked as intended.

     If lock is called with a filename or directory as  an  argument,  that
     file,  or  the files within that directory, will not be usable by oth-
     ers.  If the name that you give lock does not  currently  exist  as  a
     file  or  directory,  lock will make a directory for you of that name,
     and then make it unusable by others.

     When unlock is called with a filename or  directory  as  an  argument,
     that file, or the files within that directory, become sharable by oth-
     ers.

SEE ALSO
     Lock and unlock change modes and make directories  behind  your  back.
     Its  not  necessary but if you're the type who likes gory details, see
     "mkdir(I)" and "chmod(I)"
