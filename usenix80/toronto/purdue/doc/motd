NAME
motd -- print login message of the day


SYNOPSIS
motd (no arguments)


DESCRIPTION
"motd" is the program which is run automatically when  you  login
to  UNIX  to print applicable login messages.  It can also be run
by the shell command:
% motd

There are five types of messages which "motd" can produce:
  (1) Important information  such  as  system  maintenance  time,
  special  hardware  problems,  etc.   These messages are printed
  each time "motd" is run.
  (2)  Less  important  general  messages.   These  messages  are
  printed only once for each user.
  (3) Special messages pertaining to certain terminals  only  are
  printed only on those terminals each time "motd" is run.
  (4) Special messages  pertaining  to  certain  users  only  are
  printed only for those uers each time "motd" is run.
  (5) A message giving last the time and date of the last login
  on this user id.  If any bad attempts have been made on your
  password, the count of these will be reported.  If there are
  many reported, it would be wise to change your password, and
  report the situation to the system staff if it persists.

"motd" runs with either "root" or "bin" permission  in  order  to
access  the  special  message  files  and the file containing the
information for type #2 above (how many of  these  messages  each
user has seen).


FILES
/etc/u-seek or /etc/passwd -- used to get login name
/etc/motd -- message of the day (type #1 above)
/usr/news/banner -- general messages (type #2 above)
/usr/news/trmsg/* -- special messages
/etc/banner-log -- to keep track of how many messages have been
	been seen, as well as last login time, and password attempt
	count.

In the directory "/usr/news/trmsg", files with names  "tty?"  are
interpreted  as  special  message  files  for specific terminals,
while filenames which are login names are interpreted as  special
user messages.
