NAME
nicetty -- change priority of all processes at a given terminal

SYNOPSIS
# nicetty -<nice> <tty>

DESCRIPTION
"nicetty" can be used to change the "nice" value of all processes
with  a  given  controlling  terminal.  Any nice value may be as-
signed, but the default value, 127  has   an  additional  special
meaning  -- the system will inhibit execution of processes with a
nice of 127, thus using  "nicetty"  a  terminal  may  be  stopped
"dead".

EXAMPLES

# nicetty --5 0
        set all processes at tty0 to a nice of -5

# nicetty -5 a
        set all processes at ttya to a nice of +5

# nicetty w
        set all processes at ttyw to a nice of 127

Note that "nicetty" must be run by super-user.
