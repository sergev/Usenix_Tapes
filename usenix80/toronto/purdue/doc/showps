NAME
showps - show a string for 'ps'

SYNOPSIS
call:  showps("string1","string2",...,"stringn",0);

DESCRIPTION
Showps moves the string arguments given to the high end of
the users stack area, where they are visable to the world
via 'ps'.  Only the first 62 bytes are moved, any remaining
bytes are discarded.  Showps MUST be called first from main
since this first call shifts the user's stack down and patches
argv and argv[] to point to their shifted positions.  Its
patching technique is merely to subtract the stack shift value
from each pointer, so if you are altering these yourself it's wise
to call showps first.  After the first call showps may be called
from anywhere.
