TAIL(I)                      5/31/77                      TAIL(I)



NAME
     tail - deliver the last part of a file

SYNOPSIS
     _t_a_i_l +_number[lbc] [ file ]

DESCRIPTION
     _T_a_i_l copies the named file to the standard output  beginning
     at  a  designated  place.  If no file is named, the standard
     input is used.

     Copying begins at distance +_n_u_m_b_e_r from  the  beginning,  or
     -_n_u_m_b_e_r from the end of the input.  _N_u_m_b_e_r is counted in un-
     its of lines, blocks or characters, according to the append-
     ed  option _l, _b or _c.  When no units are specified, counting
     is by lines.

SEE ALSO
     dd(I)

BUGS
     Tails relative to the end of the file are treasured up in  a
     buffer,  and  thus  are limited in length.  Various kinds of
     anomalous behavior may happen with character special files.
