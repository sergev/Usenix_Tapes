NAME
usg -- Print usage (accounting) information

SYNOPSIS
usg [ opt ]

DESCRIPTION
This program reads the file produced by  "ktd"  and  outputs  bar
graphs (histograms) of the data.  This graph represents the aver-
age usage over the period specified when "ktd" was run.  For each
different  day that accounting was performed a new page is begun,
with a title and the date at the top of the page.  For each  line
in the graph, the time is printed to the left of the plot.

This program is capable of producing eight  possible  histograms,
selected by the parameter "opt" on the command line:

        0 -- User Process Time
        1 -- Kernel Process Time
        2 -- System Interrupt Time
        3 -- Swapping Activity
        4 -- CPU Idle Time
        5 -- RP04 Activity
        6 -- Number of RP04 Transfers
        7 -- Number of Users Logged In

If no parameter is specified, the default is 7 (number  of  users
logged in).  More than one parameter may be specified; if so, the
graphs will be printed in the requested order.

For types 0 through 6, every fifth symbol on the graph is "&" in-
stead  of "*" to facilitate easy counting.  For type 7 (users), a
different symbol is used for each different type of  terminal  in
use.
