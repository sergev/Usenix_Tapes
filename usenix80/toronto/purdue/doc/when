SOURCE LANGUAGE

AUTHOR

SYNOPSIS
when ([<user-name>] [boot] [tty#] [time]) [all]

DESCRIPTION
When looks through the file /usr/adm/wtmp, noting and printing the
occurrences of various system activities--logins, re-starts, and
time changes.  The command tells you when:
		[<user-name>] a particular user logged in
		[boot] the system was re-started (booted)
		[tty#] who has used that tty
		[time] the system time and date was reset.

If the optional parameter [all] is used, it will force printing of
all occurrences of the above options, rather than just the latest.

When can handle up through 25 options, but as this command is slow
even when system load is light, this procedure is not recommended.

DIAGNOSTICS
Usage:  when [<name>] [time] [boot] [tty#] [all]   no arguments supplied
cannot open history file: /usr/adm/wtmp   wtmp closed or missing; see 
					  UNIX staff about this

FILES
/usr/adm/wtmp     system history file
/src/new/when.c   location of c source file
/usr/bin/when     location of executable binary

BUGS
The command is very slow, especially during heavy system load (up to 1 min.).
