This is a patched up RT-11 binary which ran on an LSI-11.
It is still probably full of bugs, etc.
This has not been cleaned up for distrib yet, but here it is.

DUNGEON expects following files around:

/v/ghg/dung/dung        UNIX a.out file for Dungeon overlay 0.

/v/ghg/dtext.dat        Text file in random access-format
/v/ghg/dindex.dat       Indicies for something or other
/v/ghg/ovr              Original RT-11 DUNGEO.SAV (reads overlays from here)
/tmp/nedtmp/doverlay    If this file exists, it will be used instead of
			/v/ghg/ovr.  /tmp is on RS04 fixed head disk on our
			system, dungeon loads overlays like crazy.


If you don't like these pathnames, the binary can be patched (we don't have
source either) and the asciz strings are around 0150000 +.  There should be
plenty of room to patch in longer names, I left 15 bytes or so of zero's
at end of each pathname.  Other files of interest:

Last Minute change:
The C program "dungeon.c" which exec's in dungeon now opens these
files.  It looks in the current dir first for them.  Much easier
than patching binaries.

dungeon.c       C program with UID check and exec's in dungeon.

o.s             Assembly patches to make run under UNIX, open files,
		loads overlays, etc, etc.  This must be relocated to
		0150000 and stuck on end of dungeon binary.

p1              Shell file to patch up RT-11 core image on file d

h               8 word UNIX header to make exec file
1.s             kludge file to achive . = .+150000
mkovl           shell file to patch RT core image and make UNIX a.out file

--ghg
ps.  Some exec() sys calls get mad if the a.out file is short.
(i.e. get a killed mesg).  If this happens append a few hundred bytes
of garbage onto the end of /v/ghg/dung/dung file.

Use *.v7 files if building for V7 UNIX.
