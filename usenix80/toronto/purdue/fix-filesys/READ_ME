        In this dir is a modified version  of  Toronto's  icheck,
dcheck  and  bootchk programs, for automatic filesystem fixing on
boot up.  I have included iget.c and subr.c  from  the  Purdue/EE
kernel which have various misc fixes to leave filesystems cleaner
on crashs.  The iget.c and subr.c have been changed around to put
back  gid's  and  the  inode caching removed. These files haven't
been compiled or tested in this form, but  should  hopefully  run
with  a  plain  vanilla  V6  kernel.   They  might be used for an
example if you want to clean up  filesystem  operations  in  your
kernel.   (We  have  deviated  far  enough  from  vanilla V6 that
compiling a plain vanilla version is very  hard).   Most  of  the
changes  try  to  avoid  creating indirect blocks with garbage or
text in them if the system is stopped suddenly, as this  kind  of
filesystem  error  is  almost  impossible  to  fix by any kind of
automatic program.  Also inodes are cleared on  the  disk  before
their  blocks  are freed.  If you have any problems or questions,
call me at 317-493-3890.

I have included /etc/rc and /etc/recover shell files in this dir.
We create a file "/down" if the system shuts down in an orderly
manner.  If this file doesn't exist when /etc/rc starts running,
it is assumed a crash occured and file "/etc/recover" is invoked.
/etc/recover calls bootchk to check/fix everything and then
unmounts them. (/etc/rc mounts them again).  It is faster on
large disks (except root) to always rebuild free list, than to
check and rebuild most of time, this also sorts freelist.
Once all filesystems have recovered, "/down" is created so
/etc/rc will let boot up proceed.
