.sh NAME
dcheck \*- file system directory consistency check
.sh SYNOPSIS
.bd dcheck
[
.bd \*-q
]
[
.bd \*-r
]
[
.bd \*-i
numbers ]
[ filesystem ]
.sh DESCRIPTION
.it Dcheck
reads the directories in a file system
and compares
the link-count in each i-node with the number of directory
entries by which it is referenced.
If the file system is not specified,
a set of default file systems
is checked.
.s3
The
.bd \*-q
flag causes no output to be printed if nothing is wrong.
.s3
The
.bd \*-r
flag causes repairs to be attempted.
Basically, the inode link count will be forced to agree with the number
of entries.
A description of the repairs made will be printed.
Many common problems will be fixed correctly, but one should probably
investigate in some cases, since the fix may only prevent spreading contagion,
but not cure the disease.
It will often be necessary to follow up with "icheck -s".
.s3
The
.bd \*-i
flag
is followed by a list of i-numbers;
when one of those i-numbers turns up
in a directory,
the number, the i-number of the directory,
and the name of the entry are reported.
.s3
The program is fastest if the
raw version of the special file is used,
since the i-list is read in large chunks.
.sh FILES
Currently,
/dev/rrk2 and /dev/rrp0 are the default file systems.
.sh DIAGNOSTICS
When a file turns up for which the link-count and the number
of directory entries disagree,
the relevant facts are reported.
Allocated files which have 0 link-count and no entries are also
listed.
The only dangerous situation
occurs when there are more entries than links;
if entries are removed,
so the link-count drops to 0,
the remaining entries point to thin air.
They should be removed.
When there are more links than entries, or there is
an allocated file with neither links nor entries,
some disk space may be lost but the situation will not degenerate.
.s3
The other possible diagnostic is
"inode invalid".
This is a directory entry that points outside the inode space.
The inode, and the inumber of the directory containing the offending
entry are reported.
.s3
.it Dcheck
returns 3 bits of status: 
01 if a minor problem was found (or a major problem was found and fixed),
02 if a major problem was found, and 04 if some sort of disastrous error
occured.
.sh "SEE ALSO"
icheck (VIII), fs (V), clri (VIII), ncheck (VIII), bootchk (VIII)
.sh "U of T INFO"
Mike Tilson provided -q and -r options, and
status return,
as well as checking for invalid inodes.
.sh BUGS
Since
.it dcheck
is inherently two-pass in nature, extraneous diagnostics
may be produced if applied to active file systems.
