/src/ad
this directory contains the adventure program that originated at
the stanford ai lab;  this program has been found to be
much more addictive than star trek.

to keep some control over things (probably not for long, its the
starting to seep all over the earth) we will try to make adventure
execute only, possibly with hour restrictions if it becomes
necessary.
