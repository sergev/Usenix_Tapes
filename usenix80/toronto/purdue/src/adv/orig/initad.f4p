c  description of the database format
c
c
c  the data file contains several sections.  each begins with a line containing
c  a number identifying the section, and ends with a line containing "-1".
c
c  section 1: long form descriptions.  each line contains a location number,
c	a comma, and a line of text.  the set of (necessarily adjacent) lines
c	whose numbers are x form the long description of location x.
c  section 2: short form descriptions.  same format as long form.  not all
c	places have short descriptions.
c  section 3: travel table.  each line contains a location number (x), a second
c	location number (y), and a list of motion numbers (see section 4).
c	each motion represents a verb which will go to y if currently at x.
c	y, in turn, is interpreted as follows.  let m=y/1000, n=y mod 1000.
c		if n<=300	it is the location to go to.
c		if 300<n<=500	n-300 is used in a computed goto to
c					a section of special code.
c		if n>500	message n-500 from section 6 is printed,
c					and he stays wherever he is.
c	meanwhile, m specifies the conditions on the motion.
c		if m=0		it's unconditional.
c		if 0<m<100	it is done with m% probability.
c		if m=100	unconditional, but forbidden to dwarves.
c		if 100<m<=200	he must be carrying object m-100.
c		if 200<m<=300	must be carrying or in same room as m-200.
c		if 300<m<=400	prop(m mod 100) must *not* be 0.
c		if 400<m<=500	prop(m mod 100) must *not* be 1.
c		if 500<m<=600	prop(m mod 100) must *not* be 2, etc.
c	if the condition (if any) is not met, then the next *different*
c	"destination" value is used (unless it fails to meet *its* conditions,
c	in which case the next is found, etc.).  typically, the next dest will
c	be for one of the same verbs, so that its only use is as the alternate
c	destination for those verbs.  for instance:
c		15	110022	29	31	34	35	23	43
c		15	14	29
c	this says that, from loc 15, any of the verbs 29, 31, etc., will take
c	him to 22 if he's carrying object 10, and otherwise will go to 14.
c		11	303008	49
c		11	9	50
c	this says that, from 11, 49 takes him to 8 unless prop(3)=0, in which
c	case he goes to 9.  verb 50 takes him to 9 regardless of prop(3).
c
c	in this implementation, the second location number y has been
c	split into m, conditions, and n, location.
c
c  section 4: vocabulary.  each line contains a number (n), a tab, and a
c	five-letter word.  call m=n/1000.  if m=0, then the word is a motion
c	verb for use in travelling (see section 3).  else, if m=1, the word is
c	an object.  else, if m=2, the word is an action verb (such as "carry"
c	or "attack").  else, if m=3, the word is a special case verb (such as
c	"dig") and n mod 1000 is an index into section 6.  objects from 50 to
c	(currently, anyway) 79 are considered treasures (for pirate, closeout).
c  section 5: object descriptions.  each line contains a number (n), a tab,
c	and a message.  if n is from 1 to 100, the message is the "inventory"
c	message for object n.  otherwise, n should be 000, 100, 200, etc., and
c	the message should be the description of the preceding object when its
c	prop value is n/100.  the n/100 is used only to distinguish multiple
c	messages from multi-line messages; the prop info actually requires all
c	messages for an object to be present and consecutive.  properties which
c	produce no message should be given the message ">$<".
c  section 6: arbitrary messages.  same format as sections 1, 2, and 5, except
c	the numbers bear no relation to anything (except for special verbs
c	in section 4).
c  section 7: object locations.  each line contains an object number and its
c	initial location (zero (or omitted) if none).  if the object is
c	immovable, the location is followed by a "-1".  if it has two locations
c	(e.g. the grate) the first location is followed with the second, and
c	the object is assumed to be immovable.
c  section 8: action defaults.  each line contains an "action-verb" number and
c	the index (in section 6) of the default message for the verb.
c  section 9: liquid assets, etc.  each line contains a number (n) and up to 20
c	location numbers.  bit n (where 0 is the units bit) is set in cond(loc)
c	for each loc given.  the cond bits currently assigned are:
c		0	light
c		1	if bit 2 is on: on for oil, off for water
c		2	liquid asset, see bit 1
c		3	pirate doesn't go here unless following player
c	other bits are used to indicate areas of interest to "hint" routines:
c		4	trying to get into cave
c		5	trying to catch bird
c		6	trying to deal with snake
c		7	lost in maze
c		8	pondering dark room
c		9	at witt's end
c	cond(loc) is set to 2, overriding all other bits, if loc has forced
c	motion.
c  section 10: class messages.  each line contains a number (n), a tab, and a
c	message describing a classification of player.  the scoring section
c	selects the appropriate message, where each message is considered to
c	apply to players whose scores are higher than the previous n but not
c	higher than this n.  note that these scores probably change with every
c	modification (and particularly expansion) of the program.
c  section 11: hints.  each line contains a hint number (corresponding to a
c	cond bit, see section 9), the number of turns he must be at the right
c	loc(s) before triggering the hint, the points deducted for taking the
c	hint, the message number (section 6) of the question, and the message
c	number of the hint.  these values are stashed in the "hints" array.
c	hntmax is set to the max hint number (<= hntsiz).  numbers 1-3 are
c	unusable since cond bits are otherwise assigned, so 2 is used to
c	remember if he's read the clue in the repository, and 3 is used to
c	remember whether he asked for instructions (gets more turns, but loses
c	points).
c  section 12: magic messages. identical to section 6 except put in a separate
c	section for easier reference.  magic messages are used by the startup,
c	maintenance mode, and related routines.
c  section 0: end of database.

c  initialise the dwarves.  dloc is loc of dwarves, hard-wired in.  odloc is
c  prior loc of each dwarf, initially garbage.  daltlc is alternate initial loc
c  for dwarf, in case one of them starts out on top of the adventurer.  (no 2
c  of the 5 initial locs are adjacent.)  dseen is true if dwarf has seen him.
c  dflag controls the level of activation of all this:
c	0	no dwarf stuff yet (wait until reaches hall of mists)
c	1	reached hall of mists, but hasn't met first dwarf
c	2	met first dwarf, others start moving, no knives thrown yet
c	3	a knife has been thrown (first set always misses)
c	3+	dwarves are mad (increases their accuracy)
c  sixth dwarf is special (the pirate).  he always starts at his chest's
c  eventual location inside the maze.  this loc is saved in chloc for ref.
c  the dead end in the other maze has its loc stored in chloc2.
