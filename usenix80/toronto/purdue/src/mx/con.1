NAME
con - connect to remote host

SYNOPSIS
con <hostname>

DESCRIPTION
Con makes your terminal act like it was a terminal connected directly
to remote host <hostname>.  <hostname> is chosen from the list below.  When
your base level shell on the remote host exits (usually when you type
a control-D), the connection will be broken.

HOSTS
	NAME    FULL NAME
	a       EE PDP-11/70 service host A
	b       EE PDP-11/45 service host B
	potr    Potter PDP-11/70
	p               "
	aa      EE PDP-11/45 Advanced Automation Lab
	sp      EE PDP-11/45 Signal Processing Lab

EXAMPLES
% con p                                 [connect to potter]

% con a                                 [connect to EE]


BUGS
It would be nice if a way were available to escape back to the local host
from the remote connection, but to do so requires reserving a special
character and or column position (e.g. !shellcommand  in the editor).
In some cases (using the RAND ned editor over a connection), this would
be undesirable, so nothing has been done at present.
