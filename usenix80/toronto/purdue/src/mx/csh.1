NAME
csh - connected shell

SYNOPSIS
csh <hostname> [-l <user> <pass>] "<commands>"

DESCRIPTION
Csh runs a shell on the remote host, with its standard i/o the
same as csh's standard i/o.  <hostname> is one of the hosts on
the EE network (see below).  If your commands don't contain any
special characters for the shell (such as | ; ^ etc.), you can
omit the quotes.  If no "-l user pass" is given, you run as
userid="user" dir="/usr/user" on the other machine.  Interrupt, quit
or hangup signals on the local host will send a hangup to
the remote process.

HOSTS
	NAME    FULL NAME
	a       EE PDP-11/70 service host A
	b       EE PDP-11/45 service host B
	potr    Potter PDP-11/70
	p               "
	aa      EE PDP-11/45 Advanced Automation Lab
	sp      EE PDP-11/45 Signal Processing Lab

EXAMPLES
% csh p ps zalu                         [to peek at potter]

% csh p "date;who;ps zalu"

% nroff filename | csh a opr -ej        [to print on other machine]

% csh a "nroff | opr -ej" <filename     [gives other machine more work to do.
					  but same result as previous]
% csh p cat /usr/name/file >file        [transfers file remote->local]

% csh p -l username password "cat >file2" <file         [local->remote]

% csh p "cd /usr/name;find . -print|cpio -o"|cpio -idv  [transfers directory
							  remote->local]

FILE TRANSFER
When transfering files its easiest if you login to the machine
which is to receive the file (normally or through "con"); and
then use the first example.  If your file can be read by user
"user" there won't be any problem; if not, the "-l" option will
have to be used.

The first file transfer example (remote->local) is easier because
you dont have to type your name and password, an annoyance and
possible leak for those looking over your shoulder.


BUGS
Shortly a better file transfer program will be available that can
send whole directories or groups of files.  For the present you can
use "ar" or "cpio" to compress multiple files into a single file at
the source host and decompress this at the destination.
