Some throughput measures on our current net configuration.

The machines were configured at time of measurement as shown here:

	P ------- A ------- B ------- FU
	    dmc       da        dmc

path    hops    throughput in KBAUD
----    ----    -------------------
p-p     0       384
a-b     1       273
a-p     1       240
b-fu    1       227
a-fu    2       170
p-b     2       180
p-fu    3       136

In general it looks about like:
	1 hop   250
	2 hops  180
	3 hops  140

The actual number of blocks per second ranges from about 30 to 60.
For the intermediate machines, this is a very light load indeed since
the only processing required is that to pass the packet from the
input dma to output dma device (nothing is moved or copied).  During
copies through the B machine, the lights don't even change and
kernel timing shows the CPU 98% idle.
