IF NECESSARY, THIS ENTIRE DIRECTORY AT EE MAY BE
DELETED TO CONSERVE SPACE.  DUPLICATES ARE
AT POTTER..     ONLY FILES NECESSARY TO RUN
ADVENTURE ARE TO BE KEPT AT EE.


this is the wizard account
the main directory is to be closed off to keep these
files from propagating across the disk.

the adventure data base files are kept in this directory under
advent.txt   advent.ran   and   advent.motd

Since adventure runs suid wizard,
adventure will create advent.ran from advent.txt if advent.ran
doesn't exist.  however, advent.motd must be present or
adventure will fall on its face and not run.

advent.motd is printed at the beginning of each 'adventure'
it is intended to be used to inform the gamers about
policy, hints, etc.

.nologin is executed if someone attempts to login to user
wizard.  it simulates a shell but doesn't let the user
do anything.

the EE directory will contain only those
files necessary to run adventure.
all sources will be kept at Potter

.nologin has been taken out as the login shell due to a
small bug in the network..........

stored out on /a/advent at EE
