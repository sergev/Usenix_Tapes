     mr wizard, mr wizard.  can you give me a hint on "adventure".  I
can get into the cave, get the gold, use the bird to chase the snake,
wave the rod and cross the bridge, see the shadowy figure through the
window over the pit, get the coins, and diamonds.  But after that nothing
happens, until I get killed by one, two, or three dwarfs.  How do you
get rid of those stupid dwarfs?????????????????????????????????????????
How about a map?  No, I realize that would be too much!

Dear wizard;
     Once while exploring the plover room, i left my lamp to 
go study the emerald, however being clumsy, i fell into the pit.
Now i was reincarnated only to find i had no lamp available
any place on the surface. As this seems to be a problem for the
program i'd thought i'd draw it to your attention.
				Tnx,

Ah yes. This 'problem' has occured before.
The lamp is not on the surface but where you left it.
And you can get to the lamp but you must discover the
secret of the plover room in order to get to it.
This is a well guarded secret. You will have
to search diligently for it.
Good Luck!

adventure

Mail sent to benckens
adventure lives in /usr/bin/adventure
Sometimes during peak loads you will not be able to run
it since it tends to use the cpu and disk a lot (and it
is a game anyway).   This is the case when you get an
'adventure: not found'   message.  Usually adventure can
be found on the weekends.

I enjoy the game adventure, and have played else where.
Now I am curious if you have the fortran source, or just the 
object code ?  You see, I currently have a listing, but not
the actual source.
I also have the object on tape, and am familiar with the fact that
you could also have only the object, seeing as the source costs
money.
            please reply to:  binzel

Are you a wizard ?

From binzel Mon Nov 13 15:37:39 1978
Not being sure what you definition of a wizard, I would have to say that 
I'm not.  But I have had a perfect '350' game before.  The version I have
has the magic (maintenance mode) disabled, so I have not had a chance to
try it.  Is this avaible on you version?  

Mail to binzel
Mon Nov 13 16:45:40 EST 1978
Yes, you are a wizard!  Our version has the same cave system
as all other versions but we do not have maintenance mode.
I am trying to get a copy of the maintenance mode version.

We have the source for adventure in various forms (basic, f4p)
that will run on different machines.  We have not been
letting it out since PUCC doesn't want to see it anywhere
near the math science building and the RSTS game rooms.
If a non-wizard gets ahold of the source, he can figure
out most of the moves required to become
a wizard.  But they'll spend a lot of time tearing through
the code doing it.

Come up to 338 some time and see Geo. Goble or
Ron Reeves (reevesr) about getting a copy of the source.
I don't know if we'll be able to release it or not.

  wizard,
     When can adventure be found? I tried at 3:00 AM on saturday
and got no response.  It did not return "adventure not found" as
it usually does.  There was no response at all.  When should I
be able to find it?

response to benckins:
Adventure is usually on during the weekends but since
it is a game, the computer schedules it to be run last.
When adventure starts to run, if anything else on the
system needs to be run, the adventure game (and other
games) stops for a while to let the other users get to the
machine.
This usually occurs when there is a number cruncher running.
When you tried to run it on Saturday, adventure was
there since it didn't print the not found message.
But it couldn't get machine time since the machine
was busy doing other people's classwork.
Since the main purpose of the machine is for classwork and
research, games must come last.

I've heard of a pyramid existing in the cave.  Also, the room with the
emerald. . . how do you explore?  is there a pyramid of great worth?

any hints are appreciated.

				thanks!


Tue Dec 19 01:01:02 1978

response to inman:
Yes there is a pyramid in the cave worth some points (like any treasure)
You'll have to find it and then figure out how to get it.

The emerald is in the plover room.  Exploration of the plover room
is best left until you've fully explored the rest of the cave.
The passage is easier to find from outside the room rather than 
from inside it.

	Thanks for the hint concerning the pyramid.  Myself and a 
couple of friends have since explored the entire (?) cave and have 
discovered how to gain entrance into the plover room.  We have only
one remaining question.  This pirate, who kee
one re
      maining
       			ps popping up and
ripping us off, allegedly has a treasure chest, hidden deep
within a maze.  Is there really a treasure chest that is attain-
able?  We have wandered through both mazes(similiar and different
walls) and have seen nothing yet.  If there is a treasure chest
please let me know and I will proceed to search dilligently for
it.  Thanks again.

response to inman....
	By golly there is a chest, where else would the
pirate keep his treasures ?  Naturally he's going to hide
it well!   He spends all of his time lurking in the darkness
waiting for an adventurer with treasures.   He doesn't
want you ripping him off !!
	The chest is deep in the maze in a spot that you'd
never suspect.   Keep looking for it.  Instead of
wandering through the mazes, try gathering all the treasures
and dropping them in the maze.  Keep a list of which way you
move and what room you're in by the objects you leave around.
This may take some time.....Don't get discouraged.
	The plover room's dark secret is well kept so I can't
shed any light on it. 
	You might recall the special words you know like xyzzy
and plugh...there are several other psuedo magic words that
don't do anything special except perform high speed movement
inside the cave system.  You know these words, you just 
haven't figured out when to use them.
