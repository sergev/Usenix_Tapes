	The tek/hp size is (for all co-ordinates) assumed to be a
area of 10,240 long (x) by 7,800 tall (y).  These (absolute) co-ordinates
allow good use of the HP plotter resolution, and allow reasonable use
of the absolute co-ordingates without bothering with scaleing.
Pens in the HP are in the folloing stall/order:
1 - black	2 - Red		3 - green	4 - blue

plotp(char)	Puts charactor on correct ploting device

plotcls(pstat)	clears screen on 4014 if TEK is current device

plotty,x(#)	Prints out a 10-bit co-ordinate in TEK form.
		use 'y' for y -coordinates and a 'x' for x.

move(pstat,x,y)	Moves to point x,y.

draw(pstat,x,y)	Draws line from current locatin to (x,y)

vector(pstat,x1,y1,x2,y2)	Draws vector from (x1,y1) to (x2,y2).

plotsel(pstat,device)	Selects current device.  Device is either 
		TEK or HP .

plotinit(pstat)		Initalize the current plotting device.
	clears screen on TEK, sets the apropriate modes on HP.

setchr(pstat,csize)	Sets the current charactor size to csize.
		Valid sizes are from '0' (smallest) to '4' (largest).

setvec(pstat,vsize)	Sets vector type.  Valid types are:
	`	________  (straight line)
	a	........  (dots)
	b	._._._._  (dot-dash)
	c	_ _ _ _   (short dash)
	d	__ __ __  (long dash)

movec(pstat,c)		Update X and Y to refect current postion as
	a result of the charactor 'c' being printed.

plotc(pstat,c)	Prints the charctor 'c' on the device.  Adjust
	X and Y to refect it.

plots(pstat,string)	Prints out the 'string' on the device.
		X and Y are updated to show current position.

mover(pstat,delta_x,delta_y)	Moves to a relative position given
	by delta-x and delta-y.

drawr(pstat,delta_x,delta_y)	Draws to a relative postion given
	by delta-x and delta-y.

drawvr(pstat,dx1,dy1,dx2,dy2)	Draws a vector with start and stop
	points relative to the current location.  Vector relative
	coordinates are (dx1,dy1) to (dx2,dy2) .

point(pstat,x,y)	Puts a point at absolute co-ordinates
			(x,y) .

pmbpo(pstat,x,y)	Prints out numbers in HP MBP format.

pmbno(pstat,x,y)	Prints out number in HP MBN format.

plotend(pstat)		Should be last call to the package before a
	program terminates.  Failure to use this call can result in
	loss of data on the plotter, and will leave the pen out.  To use
	the plotter after calling 'plotend', the routine 'plotinit' must
	be (again) used to set up the plotter.



Usage Hints:

	To use the package, ceratain calls must be made to set upt the
	graphics devices.  As a good measure, the following is recomended
	for new users of the package until their knowage of the package
	increases enought that they can get themselves into their
	own trouble.


#include "/v/wa1yyn/c/plot/plot.h"
	int pstat[20];
	char plotob[600];

	.
	.
main().....
	.
	.

	pstat[HPBS] = plotob;
	plotsel(pstat,HP or TEK);	/* select plot device */
	plotinit(pstat);

	.
	.
	Plotting stuff and main program go here
	.
	.

	plotend(pstat);
}		/* end of main and exit from it	*/

	This will ensure good results.  Good luck.
