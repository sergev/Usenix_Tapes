		subroutine call instructions

	minmax(ldata,data,min,max)

		Finds the minimum value and the maximum value
		of the array data.

	scale(ldata,data,low,high)

		Puts ranges of values of array data between
		low and high.  data is returned in original
		array, and original data is lost.

	squeeze(lold,old,lnew,new)

		squeeze 'squeezes' an array of lenght
		lold into an array of lenght lnew.
		interpretation used is straight linear
		with no averaging, and squeezing factors
		of greater than 4 to one are not recomended
		if retention of data form is essential.  for
		straight-line or low frequency data, higher
		squeezing factors are allowed.

	presto(lx,x,preset)

		Presto presets an array to value  preset.
		Its main use is to zero an array, but any
		number can be used.


	calmean(lx,x,mean,variance)

		Calmean calculates the mean and variance of the
		array x.   The  mean and  variance assume a  sample
		and  NOT a population.   (i.e.  denominator  in the
		variance is a  n-1  ).    array is unchanged.


	remove(lx,x,mean)

		Remove is used to subtract out a constant from
		an array.  Typical use is  to correct  data for
		a non-zero mean value, but any number may be
		subtracted.


	detrend(lx,x)

		Detrend removes any low-freqency trends from the
		array x.  The array  x should  have a mean value
		of zero (can be done using calmean  & remove  ).


	 blgn(nsamp,data,tau,mean,stdev,hzcutoff)

		Generates  Band Limited Gaussian Noise
		into data with sampling period tau, nsamp samples,
		mean mean, and a standard deviation of stdev.
		The cutoff frequency is hzcutoff.


	 gauss(seed,sigma,mean,data)

		Generates a random variable with all the correct
		parameters.


	fold(la,a,lb,b,lc,c,sample)

		Convolves a with b into c.  Lenght of c must be
		la+lb-1.  Sample is the sample rate of the data in
		hertz.


	bound(lx,x,lower,upper)

		Bound bounds an array between the limits lower
		and upper.  The bounding operation is analogous
		to hard limiting, as opposed to 'scale' which is
		a linerar scaling.  If values beyond the bounds
		specified are encountered, the element in the
		array is set to bound that was violated.


	fft1      fft routine  -documentation to come


	simtop   -finds matrix values for toplazt
	matrix  -documentation to come.


	swap(n,data)
		
		swaps the data for time correction for use
		with the fft routine.  It take the data, divides
		it down the middle, and swaps the halfs.  'n' is
		real.

	windxxx(value,t,tzero,amplitude)

		Computes the 'value' of the window function
		at 't' given 'tzero' and the maximum 
		'amplitude' of the window function.
