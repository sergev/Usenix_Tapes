All of these routine use standard input & output devices.

blfilter.c	filters out blank lines

ucmap.c		maps lower case letter to upper case letters

lcmap.c		maps upper case letters to lower case letters

constrip.c	strips out control charactors except new-line and tab.

symcount.c	counts the symbols in assembly languege programs
		(returns a bit > du to comments and the like)

spacestrip	converts spaces in a program (such as you get from
		puke) to tabs.  Used with 6800 programs to format 
		for use with motmap to bring into compatibility with
		mas68

10con, 16con, 8con-
	Converts number to the other possible bases.

ascii	Takes a number and prints the charactor for it.

8ascii	Takes octal number and prints the charactor for it.

char	takes charactrs and prints the 10,8,16 numbers for it(them)

lsitest	Test a Leir-Siegler cursor adressing and relative
	addressing modes and the bell.

scan	[arg1] [arg2] ...
	Uses standard input/output and looks for any occurance of the
	strings in the arguments.  If an argument is found, the entire
	line is printed. Ex.- 'who | scan wa1yyn' is the same as
	a 'where wa1yyn'.

font	Takes standard input/ouput and makes 8080 code for charator
	font generation.  Assumes 5-wide (horz.) font width

bfont	Same as font but for 8 wide (horz.) fonts

motmap	Maps standard motorola 6800 sources into digestible form
	for mas68 macro assembler

newps	Using standard input/output, if it is pipped a ps, it will
	remove logins and shells from the listing, providing a more
	consise table of what's happening.

punch	Takes charctors and prints them on a paper tape punch so
	that people can read them  (i.e. a banner for the ptp).

clock	program for lsi adm-3A that puts a clock on the screen
	take numbers in that base and show thenm in the other bases.

nwho	pipe a 'who' command into it and it stacks two whos's per line.

nls	pipe a 'ls' (no options) into it and it staks four files
	per line.

reclaim	Reclaims file.lst or m.out, i.lst files from mas68 or mas80
	assemblers and gives back the source.  Use with care, as
	macros are not printed in listing and won't be recliamed on
	output.

trailspace	Removes any trailing spaces or tabs from the ends of
	lines in a program.

tabout	Tabs out a progam by one tab stop.

page	Fills page with a given charactor. i.e. '% page z' fills the
	page with the letter 'z'.

rtext	prints out page of charactors at random

leadzero	fills in leading zeros on 'masXX' series assemblers

dh	Prints out BAR registers on DH ports 0 thru 4

myport	Prints out the users terminals current dh port and port number.

rom  filname  entry_point	Makes a rom moduale for the ll68
	linking loader.

reformat	reformats 'mas' series '  .lst' files to allow for
	10 charactor lables.

hobbymap	Maps motorola standard programs into 'nice' looking
	file.  Used for hobbyist transfering programs from small
	machines where there is a single space between each field.

all others as the name implies.
