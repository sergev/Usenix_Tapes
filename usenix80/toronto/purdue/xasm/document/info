	This directory contains information on programs that exist in
   	/usr/bin/x/ .  To use the programs described here type-
	% x/program_name .  (ex.-  to use 8080 assembler type x/mas80)
	To see list of all the micro-prossesor cross support programs
	in this directory, type '% ls /usr/bin/x '.  These programs are
	currently suported solely by /v/wa1yyn (Pete Hallenbeck).  If
	there are any problems, contact him.  Other cross programs may
	exist on the system, but they are NOT supported by /v/wa1yyn.

	Many programs have 6800,6502 and 8080 versions. Look at the
documentation for one, and you have it for the other.  Note:  default
file names will be that for the machine of interest, namely:
    Machine	List	Object	Symbol
	6800	m.lst	m.out	m.sym
	6502	mt.lst	mt.out
	8080	i.lst	i.out
	If you see an XX  (i.e. cleanXX) the XX can be either a
	68,80 or 65 depending on the prosessor the program wants to
	work with.


	promXX	-Prom burning aid.  Takes ".out" file and helps with
		burning a prom.  Documentation is under 'prom68.manual'.

	cleanXX -
		Reads object files and formats into 25 byte per line
		files.  The checksum on input is Not checked, but is
		recomputed on output, allowing modification of object
		files and subsequent clean-up of the checksums.  Output
		files is 'inputfile.clean'  .

	mot68	-Motorola standard cross assembler with upward
		compatibility to mas68 (i.e. macros, arithmetic etc.).

	packXX	- Packs object files.  Manual is pretty complete
		Exist for 6800,8080 & 6502.

	re68.manual	-Manual for relocatible 6800 assembler

	re80.manual	-Manual for relocatible 8080 assembler

	ll68.manual	-linking loader for 're68'.

	ll80.manual	-linking loader for 're80'.

	masXX.manual	-manual for the various absolute assemblers
			themselves
	dis68,80 [filename] [symbol_table]  Dissasembler for 6800 and 8080.
		Dissasembled file is called 'filename.dis'.  Sybol table
		is in format of assembler output (i.e. :
		adress	symbol		address	symbol	   ....)
		There can be 1 or more entrys per line, free format.

	dis65		Disassembler for 6800 and 6502.
		Same as dis80, except output goes to terminal.
		Does not support symbol table.

	rommod.manual	Manual for making rom moduals for the relocatible
		assemblers/loaders


Other routines in /usr/bin/x :

	reclaim [filename]	Strips out the numbers generated by
		an assemblers.  It trys to reclaim the source from the
		' .lst' file.

	leadzero filename	Adds leading zeros to a ' .lst' file.
		uses standard IO or filename.

	symcount [filename]	Counts up the number of symbols in a
		source program.  Also counts the number of charactors in
		the symbols, and the number of lines in the program.

	reformat [filename]	Reformats 'mas' series assemblers '.lst'
		files for 10 charactors lables.  Produces some odd
		looking 'db' (fcb) statments.

	hobbymap [filename]	Reformats motolola standard (only) programs
		written for small machines into 'nice' looking programs.
		Input file is assumed to have a single space between
		the various fields.  This program is Not entirely guarentied
		to work.	i.e. should look like:
		lable lda a #data
		 clr data comment

	size68 [filename]	Gives count of all the bytes in a 'S1'
		type record.

	size80 [filename]	Gives count of all the bytes in a ':0'
		type record.

	sdl [speed] filename	Dumps out "filename.sym" onto terminal
		with padding correct for "msd" symbolic 6800 debugger.

	saveabyte68 filename	Goes through the program and prints out
		the line numbers of any 'jsr's or 'jmp's that could be
		'bsr's or 'bra's.
