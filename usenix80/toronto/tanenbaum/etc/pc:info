Pc compiles pascal programs. Pascal program file names must end with '.p'
The most simple use is
	pc prog.p
This creates a file "e.out". To run it, type
	em1
For more information type
	man pc
Note, that Pascal as accepted by the current compiler is just as
described in "PASCAL: User manual and report", except that you have
to do a "get(input)" before reading from input.
