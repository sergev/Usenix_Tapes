.sh NAME
e.out \*- pc:ass output
.sh DESCRIPTION
.it E.out
is the output file of the EM1 assembler/loader
.s3
This file has six sections:
two headers, code, data, a procedure table, and relocation information
for the EM1 interpreter
(in that order).
.s3
The first header contains 8 words:
.s3
.lp +5 3
1	A magic number (low byte 172. , high byte 14.)
.lp +5 3
2	Default flags for interpreter.
.br
Bit 0 specifies test or not
.br
Bit 1 specifies profiling or not
.br
Bit 2 specifies flowmarking or not
.br
Bit 3 specifies line counting or not
.br
Bit 4 specifies use of external functions or not
.br
Bit 5 specifies use of floating point or not
.lp +5 3
3	Number of unresolved references.
.lp +5 3
4	unused
.lp +5 3
5	unused
.lp +5 3
6	unused
.lp +5 3
7	unused
.lp +5 3
8	unused
.s3
.i0
The second header also contains 8 words:
.s3
.lp +5 3
1	The size of the code
.lp +5 3
2	The size of the data
.lp +5 3
3	The size of the uninitialized dataportion (logically in front of the data)
.lp +5 3
4	The size of the proctabel ( =4*number of procedures)
.lp +5 3
5	The size of the relocation information ( =2*number of relocations)
.lp +5 3
6	The procedure number of the entrypoint
.lp +5 3
7	The number of lines in sourcecode
.lp +5 3
8	unused
.i0
.s3
All sizes are in bytes, but the code and data portions of the file
are filled with a zero byte if odd.
.s3
The relocation information consists of a list of addresses in
the external address space, that contain addresses in external adress space.
The interpreter has to know this because it is the responsibility
of the interpreter to assign values to addresses.
