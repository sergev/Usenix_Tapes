.th EFLOW I 3/28/79
.sh NAME
eflow \*- list pascal program with never executed lines marked
.sh SYNOPSIS
eflow sourcefile [flow file]
.sh DESCRIPTION
Eflow makes a listing of the source program with in front of every line
it's line number plus an asterisk if that line was never executed 
in a previous execution.
.s1
Eflow gets it's information form the flow file (default em1:flowtab)
which is produced under the -f option of em1(I).
.sh FILES
em1:flowtab for profile
.sh "SEE ALSO"
pc(I), em1(I), ecount(I), eprof(I)
.sh BUGS
Procedures without a PASCAL statement in them are marked as not
executed, although they might have been.
.s1
The program should be smart enough not to place asterisks before
declarations, that would make searching for lines never executed
easier.
