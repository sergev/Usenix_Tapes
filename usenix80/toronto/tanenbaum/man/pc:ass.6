.sh NAME
pc:ass \*- EM1 assembler/loader
.sh SYNOPSIS
/usr/ovl/pc:ass [-s(s/m/l)] argument ...
.sh DESCRIPTION
pc:ass assembles and links EM1 modules.
Arguments may be flags, EM1 modules, EM1 archive entries or libraries.
Flags recognised are:
.lp +5 5
-d	produce debugging output
.lp +5 5
-p	list all procedurenames together with base-address (decimal and octal),
procedure number and module of definition.
.lp +5 5
-l	-l<string> is identical to /usr/lib/em1:<string>.a

.s3
pc:ass scans it's arguments, discriminating between the various
types, producing an e.out file as described in e.out(V).
Difference is made between compulsory modules and so called
archive entries (They need not be in an archive).
Compulsory modules are always loaded whether or not they 
contain "wanted" procedures or datalabels.
Archive entries on the other hand will only be loaded
if they contain definitions of procedures or data imported by
previously assembled modules.
.s3
Note that it is not possible to do a partial load,
loading starts from compact EM1 code and produces binary
EM1 code. No symboltable, no relocation bits will be produced.

.sh DIAGNOSTICS
Various diagnostics may be produced. In the case of compiler
produced code however the only messages to expect are of the
form: Overflow in XXXX. This can usually be repaired by giving
a -sl flag. Also possible are unresolved references, for example
after forgetting to give a library as argument.
