.sh NAME
pc:opt \*- em1 local optimizer
.sh SYNOPSIS
/usr/ovl/pc:opt [-s(s/m/l)] [-lvd] [-L externals file] [input file]
.sh DESCRIPTION
Opt is a local em1-optimizer that takes a compact em1 program as input
and produces an optimized compact em1 program as output.
.s3
The flags recognized are:
.lp +5 5
-v	produce of the translation process dumps on standard output
(for debugging purposes).
.lp +5 5
-d	flush buffers between procedures (debugging also)
.lp +5 5
-L	take the next argument as the filename for externals-output,
and write records of 9 characters on that file.
Records have as their first character p or g for procedure or
global symbol name followed by an 8 character name.
If no filename is given, standard input is read.
.s3
.lp +5 5
-l	produce a readable listing of the binary output on file listing
.lp +5 5
-s(s/m/l)	optimize a small,medium or large program.
Selection of the smallest option will optimize faster, with risk of table
overflow.
.s3
.i0
The optimization done by pc:opt is driven by an optimization table.
Lines of this table look like
.br
loc 1  add *  ,  ,   inc *  ,  ,
.br
This particular example will produce an inc whenever loc 1 and add
follow each other without intervening labels.
Also possible are some specialised optimizations that are marked
with a number behind the line in tables.
These numbers correspond with some specialised routines in pc:opt
and cannot be changed at will.
The user can however add or delete lines without numbers at will.
