.sh NAME
pc:pem \*- Pascal to EM1 compiler
.sh SYNOPSIS
/usr/ovl/pc:pem prog.err
  or
.br
em1 /usr/ovl/pc:pem.out prog.err
.sh DESCRIPTION
Pem is a Pascal compiler producing compact EM1 assembly code.
The EM1 machine is described in [1].
The language Pascal is developped by N. Wirth and is described
in the "Pascal User Manual and Report" [2].
The compiler complies as much as possible with the ISO standard proposal [3].
The language features as processed by this compiler are described in
the Pascal-VU reference manual [4].
.s3
Normally the compiler is called by means of the user interface program
pc(I). These two programs use an intermediate file to pass the
optional compiler options, given as flag to pc(I), to the compiler.
This same file is used to write the compact EM1 code on.
Pc(I) produces the error messages based on the information on 
a second file, the standard output of the compiler.

.sh DIAGNOSTICS
Compilation errors are written as number triplets onto standard output.
Each triplet consists of error number, line number and character number.
Positive numbers are used for irrecoverable errors, negative ones for warnings.
Pc searches the file /usr/etc/pc:errors to find the corresponding messages.
.sh "EXIT STATUS"
.lp +7 5
0	no severe problems; however, there may be errors in your program.
.lp +7 5
<>0	compilation is aborted and a message is given on the diagnostic
output. For instance "stack overflow", meaning that your program is too big
to be compiled.
