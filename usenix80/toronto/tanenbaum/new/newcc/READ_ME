In this directory you find our C-compiler, which is necessary
to compile the pc-sources.

The only changes are:
      A: increase the size of the define table in cc.c. (symsiz)
         it was 200 and must be 350.
      B: repair a bug in the optimizer. we only changed c21.c.

To make adaption to your installation easy, we extracted the pathnames
and the table sizes from cc.c and placed them on a file "local.h".
The current pathnames in "local.h" are the original ones.
Inspect this file carefully and adapt it to your installation.

There are some more changes in cc.c in this directory, but they are
disabled by deleting some defines.
If you like them, you may include those defines again.
Those changes are not necessary to compile the pc-sources.

The "run" file is changed, so that it creates the new version in this
directory. Type
	sh install
to install the new version. The old version is saved in this directory
with suffix ".old".
