The program Utar is an executable version of "tar" as distributed
by Berkeley in 1979.  It is intended only for extraction of
files from this tape.  Not all of the features of this "tar" are
implemented in the "Utar" on this tape.  The syntax of Utar is that of "tar".

NAME
     tar - tape archiver

SYNOPSIS
     tar [ key ] [ name ... ]

DESCRIPTION
     Tar saves and restores files on magtape.  Its actions are
     controlled by the key argument.  The key is a string of
     characters containing at most one function letter and possi-
     bly one or more function modifiers.  Other arguments to the
     command are file or directory names specifying which files
     are to be dumped or restored.  In all cases, appearance of a
     directory name refers to the files and (recursively) sub-
     directories of that directory.

     The function portion of the key is specified by one of the
     following letters

     r       The named files are written on the end of the tape.
             The c function implies this.

     x       The named files are extracted from the tape.  If the
             named file matches a directory whose contents had
             been written onto the tape, this directory is
             (recursively) extracted.  The owner, modification
             time, and mode are restored (if possible).  If no
             file argument is given, the entire content of the
             tape is extracted.  Note that if multiple entries
             specifying the same file are on the tape, the last
             one overwrites all earlier.

     t       The names of the specified files are listed each
             time they occur on the tape.  If no file argument is
             given, all of the names on the tape are listed.

     u       The named files are added to the tape if either they
             are not already there or have been modified since
             last put on the tape.

     c       Create a new tape; writing begins on the beginning
             of the tape instead of after the last file.  This
             command implies r.

     o       On output, tar normally places information specify-
             ing owner and modes of directories in the archive.
             Former versions of tar, when encountering this
             information will give error message of the form
                  "<name>/ cannot create".
             This option will suppress the directory information.

     p       This option says to restore files to their original

             modes, ignoring the present umask(2).  Setuid and
             sticky information will also be restored to the
             super-user.

     The following characters may be used in addition to the
     letter which selects the function desired.

     0,...,7   This modifier selects an alternate drive on which
               the tape is mounted.  (The default is drive 0 at
               1600 bpi, which is normally /dev/rmt8.)

     v         Normally tar does its work silently.  The v (ver-
               bose) option causes it to type the name of each
               file it treats preceded by the function letter.
               With the t function, v gives more information
               about the tape entries than just the name.

     w         causes tar to print the action to be taken fol-
               lowed by file name, then wait for user confirma-
               tion. If a word beginning with `y' is given, the
               action is performed. Any other input means don't
               do it.

     f         causes _t_a_r to use the next argument as the name of
               the archive instead of /dev/rmt?. If the name of
               the file is `-', tar writes to standard output or
               reads from standard input, whichever is appropri-
               ate. Thus, _t_a_r can be used as the head or tail of
               a filter chain _T_a_r can also be used to move
               hierarchies with the command
                 cd fromdir; tar cf - . | (cd todir; tar xf -)

     b         causes _t_a_r to use the next argument as the block-
               ing factor for tape records. The default is 20
               (the maximum). This option should only be used
               with raw magnetic tape archives (See f above).
               The block size is determined automatically when
               reading tapes (key letters `x' and `t').

     l         tells _t_a_r to complain if it cannot resolve all of
               the links to the files dumped. If this is not
               specified, no error messages are printed.

     m         tells _t_a_r to not restore the modification times.
               The mod time will be the time of extraction.

     Previous restrictions dealing with _t_a_r's inability to prop-
     erly handle blocked archives have been lifted.

FILES
     /dev/rmt?
     /tmp/tar*

DIAGNOSTICS
     Complaints about bad key characters and tape read/write
     errors.
     Complaints if enough memory is not available to hold the
     link tables.

BUGS
     There is no way to ask for the _n-th occurrence of a file.
     Tape errors are handled ungracefully.
     The u option can be slow.
     The current limit on file name length is 100 characters.
