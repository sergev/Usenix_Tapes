mgt.rpt \*- management report
.sh SYNOPSIS
.bd mgt.rpt
[
.bd -h
][
.bd -n
days][
.bd -d
date]
.sh DESCRIPTION
.it Mgt.rpt
prints a daily management report in two formats.
Data for this report is reduced from 
.it shell
accounting
information,
.it login
accounting, and
.it probe
accounting
data by the program /sys/prog/mgt.sum and placed in the file /usr/adm/mgt.data.
One year of summary data is stored in the file /usr/adm/mgt.data
(documented in /usr/include/mg.rec.h).
If the file /usr/adm/mgt.data does not exist
.it mgt.rpt
exits.
Each format displays data for the report day, and
comparison data for the previous 30 days of system
operation.
Summary data is provided at the end of the report.
The default report date is yesterday.
The default report is a daily management report containing
the following fields;
.s3
Date of the data.
.s3
Average response time in seconds for prime shift 0800 to 1700 hours.
.s3
Ninety percent response time in seconds.  This value indicates
that 90% of the responses were below this value.
.s3
Average elapsed time in minutes for command execution.
.s3
User support factor.
A fundamental characteristic of interactive system response
is a slowly rising response time with increasing load.
Beyond a critical point this rise becomes more rapid.
At this point, the "knee" of the curve, the system is considered
saturated.
The user support factor indicates the number of users this system can
support before saturation.
This number is derived from the ratio of real time to cpu time for
commands, and the ratio of login time to cpu time for a user.
Thus, this number is related to the types of processing a community
of users is doing.  
During weekends, and other days of minimal processing this number will be lower
because system processes (cron, etc...) remain relatively constant while
user logins are few enough to not get a representative sample
of use.
.s3
Percent up is the percentage of the day the system was available
for use by users (i.e., in 
.it leton
mode).
.s3
Number of times down represents the number of periods
the system was unavailable to users.
This number in incremented each time the system is
taken down through
.it operate,
.it drain,
or
.it kickoff.
.s3
Number of crashes the system experienced during the day.
This number is incremented each time the system is not
taken down through
.it operate.
.s3
Prime time CPU utilization is the percentage that the processor
was active in user processes during  the prime shift 0800 to 1700 hours.
.s3
CPU hours is the total CPU hours of user process activity for the day.
.s3
Login hours is the total of each user login session duration.
.s3
Average prime time users logged in.
If this number is the same or higher than the user support factor
the system was saturated.
.s3
Maximum prime time users.
.s3
Number of commands executed by the shell.
.s3
Number of processes executed.
.s3
The current day of the report will be highlighted with
asterisks flagging fields that fail to meet critical
objectives printed in the highlighted field area.
.s3
At the bottom of the report is a summary of
all days reported.
Totals (where appropriate), averages, week day averages,
minimum, and maximum values are printed.
.s3
The following flags modify the operation of
.it mgt.rpt
operation;
.i0
.s3
.lp +6 5
\fB\*-n\fR	Change the number of days reported to
.it days.
Default is 30 days.
.i0
.s3
.lp +6 5
\fB\*-d\fR	Change report date to
.it date.
Default is yesterday.
Date can be in the following formats;
Month Day Year (mm dd yy);  Military- Day Month Year
(dd mmm [19]yy);  Data processing - Year Month Day (yymmdd);
Julian - Year Day (yyddd).
.i0
.s3
.lp +6 5
\fB\*-h\fR	Change report format to 
"high water" mark report.
This report format shows the daily maximum utilization of internal
unix resources.
Fields reported are;
.s3
Date of the data.
.s3
Reboots during the report day.
.s3
Number of times system was unavailable for users.
.s3
System crashes, or the number of times the system
was NOT brought down orderly through the
.it operate
command.
.s3
Maximum number of processes executed simultaneously.
.s3
Maximum number of core blocks in execution simultaneously
that can be swapped out.
This number does not include shared text segments.
.s3
Maximum number of swapable blocks residing in core simultaneously.
.s3
Maximum number of processes in core.
.s3
Maximum number of swappable blocks swapped out.
This number does not include swapped out text segments.
.s3
Maximum number of processes ready to run at once.
.s3
Maximum number of processes ready to run that are swapped out.
.s3
The minimum number of 64 byte chunks of core that are free.
.s3
Maximum number of coremap table entries that are used.
.s3
Minimum number of blocks of swap space available.
.s3
Maximum number of swapmap table entries that are used.
.s3
Maximum file table entries.
.s3
Maximum inode table entries.
.s3
Maximum text table entries.
.s3
Maximum "sticky bit" entries within the text table.
.s3
Maximum callout table entries.
.s3
Maximum number of
characters waiting in teletype queues.
.s3
The current day is highlighted at the bottom of the report,
and a maximum or minimum for the fields is provided.
