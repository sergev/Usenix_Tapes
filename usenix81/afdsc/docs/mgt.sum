.th MGT.SUM FORM "Nov 80"
.sh NAME "/sys/prog/mgt.sum \*- summarize management accounting files"
/sys/prog/mgt.sum \*- summarize management accounting files
.sh SYNOPSIS
.bd /sys/prog/mgt.sum
.sh DESCRIPTION
.it Mgt.sum
is a system program that summarizes daily system databases and
reduces their data into a consolidated database.
.it Mgt.sum
reads the files /usr/adm/log.hold, /usr/adm/sh2.hold,
and /usr/adm/pr.hold
(documented in /usr/include/acct.h, /usr/include/acct2.h, and /usr/include/pr.rec.h).
Using these files containing one day of data,
.it mgt.sum
writes a single 128 byte record to the file /usr/adm/mgt.data.
If any one of the files is absent
.it mgt.sum
exits.
Thus, to start
.it mgt.sum
accounting, empty these files once.
Records are placed in the /usr/adm/mgt.data file (documented in /usr/include/mg.rec.h) in julian day
order, thus 1 Jan data goes in slot one, 2 Jan in slot 2 and so on.
.it Mgt.sum
maintains one year of data with this direct access scheme.
.s3
While most of the data fields of /usr/adm/mgt.data are straight
manipulations of the respective holding accounting files, the fields
user support factor (USF), response time, and 90% response time are
determined within
.it mgt.sum.
.s3
Response time and 90% response time are synthesized from the
.it probe
accounting data.
The basic design of
.it UNIX
permits a single process in execution to capture as many system
resources as it needs to complete.
Thus a process not encumbered by terminal I/O (command redirected to a file)
will complete with its CPU time nearly equal to wall clock time
for a job lengthening factor (JLF) of one.
This same design feature of
.it UNIX
dictates that two or more identical processes will take longer
in proportion to the number of processes in execution.
If enough data is known about how many processes are currently
executing, it is possible to compute the relative response time
or JLF that users are currently experiencing.
To make the number more meaningful
.it mgt.sum
references the response time to the actually measured
single user response time of frequently used commands.
In the following formula for response time, RTBASE is
response time for common simple commands (cp, ps, who, sh, mv, date, ...etc)
as measured
.it once
. 8
by oscilloscope setup with each system configuration.
Response times for each sample of the probe database
are averaged for the day, and a 90 % response determined also.
Response time is computed from the formula below;
.s3
Where;
 rt = response time in seconds for the sample period
 RTBASE = response time constant measured once for each system
 pc = processes in core and ready to run
 sc = core blocks ready to run, but swapped out
 sp = processed swapped out and ready to run
 SWSPEED = swap speed of 100 blocks per second
.s3
 Then;
 rt = (RTBASE * pc) + ((RTBASE + (sc /(SWSPEED * sp))) * sp)
.s3
The user support factor is based on data from both
.it login
accounting and
.it shell
accounting.
Based on the assumption that a system is saturated when
the processor is busy continuously, the number of "average"
users a system can support is based on the reciprocal
of CPU time to wall clock time for a user's system interactions.
However, a USF figure based on JLF alone does not take into account
the average user's "think time"
as a way of allowing other users time to process.
.it Mgt.sum
uses both JLF and the reciprocal of the session (login time)
to compute the USF from the formula below;
.s3
 Where;
 USF = User support factor
 wt = total command wall clock time
 lt = total user login time (time of all sessions)
 cpu = total command CPU time
.s3
 Then;
 USF = (wt + lt) / (2 * cpu)
