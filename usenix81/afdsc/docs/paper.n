1.  This paper describes the Air Force Data Services Center
(AFDSC) Management Reporting System.  The system was born out of
a management problem:


    a.  Over three thousand AFDSC customers (including 800+ UNIX
[1]  users) were getting good and bad impressions of ADP on a
daily basis.  Truth, rumors, priorities, and "politics" prevented
reliable feedback about user satisfaction to management.


    b.  There was no easy means to tell if system service level
was high or low (i.e., the customers were right or wrong in their
complaints).  There was no easy means to compare today's perfor-
mance with that of past days.  There was no _c_o_m_m_o_n data collec-
tion among different OS's to allow performance comparison.


    c.  There was no means to benchmark system "enhancements" in
a real user environment.  Most operating system (OS) diagnostics
were _t_o_o informative and specific.  For UNIX, there were no OS
diagnostics to even start with.


2.  The AFDSC-wide solution encompassed many features:


    a.  A daily report was standardized for _a_l_l AFDSC systems
(IBM, GCOS, MULTICS, UNIX).


    b.  Only four areas were presented:  Performance (response
time); Availability (up and down times, number of crashes); Util-
ization (cpu time, login hours); and Workload (number of users
and commands).


    c.  Yesterday's data was compared with that of the past 30
days.


    d.  Summarizations, averages, max and min values were
displayed for the 30 days prior, to aid in comparisons.

3.  The UNIX Implementation involved:


    a.  _N_o kernel changes (/dev/kmem is read from without).


    b.  A "probe" program to access the running kernel and take
snapshots of system status and tables.


    c.  A "mgt.sum" program to merge login, shell, and "probe"
accounting files; compute response time using "probe" accounting
and synthesis technique; compute "user support factor" (number of
users this system can support).


    d.  A "mgt.rpt" user command to print a daily management
report or a kernel "high-water" report (showing utilization of
system resources such as tables).


4.  The benefits we derived were numerous:


    a.  Automatic tracking of crashes that are usually difficult
to trap by automated means.


    b.  Consistent, reproducable analysis techniques.


    c.  Documentation of "enhancements" during real use (versus
"gut feeling").


    d.  Reliable sizing of system tables.


    e.  Measurement of system size versus user community size.


    f.  Reporting system can be disabled without internal
changes.
