.sh DESCRIPTION
.it Probe
is a system program that collects
data on internal
.it UNIX
resource utilization.
.it Probe
reads portions of the 
.it running
kernel and produces a report on the internal status
of process and table resources.
Execution of 
.it probe
without arguments produces a one line report
of numbers indicating the following data;
.s3
User count.
.s3
Total executing swapable block count.
.s3
Incore executing swapable block count.
.s3
Total processes.
.s3
Processes incore.
.s3
Processes getting CPU time.
.s3
Processes ready to run.
.s3
Processes ready to run, but swapped out.
.s3
Blocks of ready to run, but swapped out.
.s3
Total tty character count from tty queues.
.s3
Free core in 64 byte chunks.
.s3
Maximum core (not currently set).
.s3
Coremap table entries used.
.s3
Free swap space in blocks.
.s3
Maximum swap space available.
.s3
Swapmap table entries used.
.s3
File table entries used.
.s3
Inode table entries used.
.s3
Text table entries used.
.s3
"Sticky bit" entries used in text table.
.s3
Callout table entries used.
.s3
The following flags modify
.it probe
operation;
.s3
.i0
.lp +6 5
\fB\*-c\fR	Instead of providing one report, cycle each
"cycletime" seconds.
.i0
.s3
.lp +6 5
\fB\*-f\fR	Instead of printing output to standard output
place output in the file /usr/adm/pr.act.
The file /usr/adm/pr.act must exist or
.it probe
exits.
To activate
.it probe
system
.it empty
/usr/adm/pr.act;
At the end of day
.it probe
automatically copies /usr/adm/pr.act to /usr/adm/pr.hold,
empties /usr/adm/pr.act, and continues placing new data in
/usr/adm/pr.act
(documented in /usr/include/pr.rec.h).
This allows one day's worth of data to be present for
the program
.it mgt.sum
which combines
.it probe
data with
.it login
and
.it shell
accounting data into a consolidated
database of system utilization.
This is used in conjunction with the "cycle-time" flag to automatically
capture daily system data.
This option causes
.it probe
to lock out multiple invocations of probe via a lock file
/usr/lock/probe where the process ID of the currently
running
.it probe
is kept in the lock file.
A new invocation of
.it probe
will kill a previous invocation using the process ID
in the lock file.
This flag also enables operation of several other flags
described below.
.i0
.s3
.lp +6 5
\fB\*-u\fR	If the \*-f flag is in effect, write a record
on the /usr/adm/pr.act file indicating the system is up.
.i0
.s3
.lp +6 5
\fB\*-d\fR	If the \*-f flag is in effect, write a record
on the /usr/adm/pr.act file indicating the system is down.
.i0
.s3
.lp +6 5
\fB\*-k\fR	If the \*-k flag is in effect, kill off
the currently running
.it probe
process and exit.
.i0
.s3
.lp +6 5
\fB\*-i\fR	Causes the printing of inode table information
on default terminal report.
Information printed is;
Flags; inode count; major minor device; inode number; mode;
number of links; user ID; group ID.
.sh EXAMPLE
/sys/prog/probe \*-f \*-c 180&
.s3
Start probe reporting data to the file /usr/adm/pr.act
every 180 seconds.
.s3
/sys/prog/probe
.s3
Execute one pass of probe to standard output.
.sh FILES

.sh DIAGNOSTICS
.it Probe
prints "Eod probe processing" upon completing the
copy of pr.act to pr.hold at the change of day.
