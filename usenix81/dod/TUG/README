	The tug directory contains eight files of nroff commands
and text that can be processed using nroff to produce a formatted
version of the UNIX Terminal User's Guide(TUG). The nroff files
are identified by a ".nr" suffix. An already formatted copy of the
entire document is contained in the file "tugtxt".
	The nroff files contain macros from the mnm macro package.
A copy of this macro package has been included with the TUG
material for reference by those users who are unfamiliar with it.
It is located in the mnm directory. To explain the use of the macro
package a copy of a document entitled "The Users' Guide to the NM
Macro Package(pib-78-006)" has been included in the same directory.
	Also included with the TUG material is a shell print file
which users can invoke so as to readily obtain printed copies of
the document. Executing the print shell command will cause nroff to
be invoked (with the necessary files as arguments), its output
piped to the line printer, and the entire job put in background.
