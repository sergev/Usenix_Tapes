.PH INTRODUCTION 0 3 3 2
This paper describes the 'NM' macros which are actually the 'EM' macros
but revised to work with PWB/UNIX Nroff.  The macros are all the same
as the 'EM' macros plus there are a few new features.  The 'EM' macros
don't work correctly with PWB/UNIX Nroff, and these 'NM' macros don't
work correctly with the old Nroff.  The 'EM' macros are still
available for use with the old Nroff ( onroff ).
.PP
This paper describes a preferred set of general purpose NROFF macros which
are useful for producing memoranda, letters, lists, and informal documents.
It does not support footnotes, double column output, and other
specialized functions.
This set is designed to be easy to learn and use and still provide a variety
of styles.
Note that this paper was produced by this set.
.PP
This guide has three sections.
The first section,
.I "GETTING STARTED,"
helps the user learn the names and functions of the macros.
It is suggested that the user sit at a terminal and type in the examples
of this section.
.I OPTIONS
to these macros are described in the second section.
The user can refer to this section for help in getting different styles
from the macros.
Some of the possible styles are shown in the third section,
.I EXAMPLES.
.PH PREREQUISITES
The user should be able to create and edit UNIX files.
It is suggested that the user have a level of understanding
equivalent to or have available the following documents:
.L1 9 2
B.W. Kernighan, "UNIX for Beginners"
.L1
J.F. Ossanna, "NROFF Users' Manual"

.sp
.in5
.br
&ds CL SUPER HUSH HUSH
.PP
The classification will automatically appear at the top and bottom.
.PH SIMPLE~PARAGRAPHS
Paragraphs are made with a ".PP" line.
This automatically sets up the line spacing and indentation for
the paragraph.
To get double spacing between paragraphs and no indentation (block style)
like this;
.sp
.in5
Now is the time for all good men to come to the aid of their country.
.sp

.br
&PP
.br
The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog's back.
.PH PARAGRAPHS~WITH~HEADINGS
A heading can be put over a paragraph by using a ".PH" line.
Line spacing and indentation for the paragraph and its heading
are taken care of by the macro.
To get this;
.sp
.in5
Now is the time for all good men to come to the aid of their country.
.sp

.sp 3
.PP
These macros put the indentation to zero.
A heading and a number can be put over a paragraph by using the #.P1#
- #.P6# options.  There are six levels of numbers.  To get this;
.in 5
.P1 SNOOPY'S~LAMENT
The quick brown fox jumped over the poor, unfortunate dog's back.
.P2 NOW
Now is the time for all good men to come to the aid of their country.

.br
&P2 NOW
.br
Now is the time for all good men to come to the aid of their country.
.i0
.PP
The number registers aa through ff refer to .P1 through .P6
respectively.  A different effect can be achieved by changing the
assigned format of these registers.  For example,
.in 5
.nf
.br
&P1 SNOOPY'S~LAMENT
.br
The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog's back.
.br
&af bb A
.br
&P2 NOW
.br
Now is the time for all good men to come to the aid of thier country.

.in 0
will produce:
.fi
.P1 SNOOPY'S~LAMENT
The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog's back.
.af bb A
.P2 NOW
Now is the time for all good men to come to the aid of the country.
.af bb 1
.PP
This can be done with any level of the heading and using any legal format.
.in 0
.PP
All the numbers and headings of the P1 through P6 paragraphs are
remembered so they can be output in the table of contents.  To invoke
the table of contents at the end of your paper just type  #.TC#.
.PH LISTS
Lists are automatically numbered and indented.

.PH TABLE~OF~CONTENTS
The numbers and headings of all paragraphs made by the .P1, .P2,....P6
macros will be remembered so that a table of contents can be print.
These are the
.I only
ones that will be in the table of contents.  Any headings or numbers
from .PH macros are not remembered.  To get the table of contents
just type;
.br
.ti5
&TC
.br
The table of contents is already set up, with heading "Table of Contents",
and pages beginning with i.
.PH TYPING~HINTS
.L1
The tilde ($) can be used to get exact spacing between characters.
For example, to prevent extra spaces between John and Doe, use
.sp
.ti10
John$Doe
.sp
.L1
To insure that a word won't be hyphenated, place a caret (@)
adjacent to the first letter of the word.
.ds H3 OPTIONS
.bp
.PH UNDERSTANDING~THE~OPTIONS 0 3 3 2
Options to these macros are indicated by brackets "[]".
The name of the option is located inside the brackets.
Most options take numeric values.
Further detail is offered for the following options.
.sp
.L1
line spacing
.br
options referring to line spacing require numeric values.
0~=~no~spacing, 1~=~single~spacing, 2~=~double spacing, etc.
.sp
.L1
assigned format
.br
assigned format options require special characters to give
different types of numbering.
.sp
.I "		use	for"
.br
		1	1,2,3,4,...
.br
		i	i,ii,iii,iv,...
.br
		I	I,II,III,IV,...
.br
		a	a,b,c,...
.br
		A	A,B,C,...
.br
	   *    \\(bu    \(bu,\(bu,...
.br
	   *    \\(sq    \(sq,\(sq,...
.br
*(The \\(bu and \\(sq
.it only
work on the .L1-.L6 list options.)
.sp
.L1
string
.br
options referring to string require a "string" of characters.
When the string includes spaces, enclose the string in quotes
or use tildes ($).
.PH USING~THE~OPTIONS
Options have to be set only once.
Options must be set in sequence.
For example, suppose ".AA" is a macro with options a,b,c.
.sp
.in5
.br
&AA [a] [b] [c]
.PP
To set option "b" to 5, you must also give a value for option "a".
.sp
.in5
.br
&AA 10 5
.PP
sets "a" to 10 and "b" to 5, but
.sp
.in5
.br
&AA 5
.sp
.in 0
sets only "a" to 5.
.PH FONTS
Three types of fonts are available:~~Roman, Italic, and Bold.
Most printing is done with a Roman font.
When using TROFF and a phototypesetter, the Italic and Bold fonts
cause italic and bold printing.
When using NROFF, underlining is substituted for italic and bold printing.
(Note that when using CRT's, only the underlining is displayed.)
.PH ROMAN~FONT
.in5
.br
&R [string]
.PP
If a string is given, it is made Roman.
If a string is not given, printing enters Roman mode until changed.
.PH ITALIC~FONT
.in5
.br
&I [string]
.PP
If a string is given, it is italicized.
If a string is not given, printing enters Italic mode until changed.
This font is preferred over bold.
.PH BOLD~FONT
.in5
.br
&B [string]
.sp
.in0
If a string is given, it is made bold.
If a string is not given, printing enters Bold mode until changed.
.PH HEADINGS~AND~FOOTINGS
Left and right adjusted headings and footings are also possible.
They appear on the first heading line (H1) and on the last footing line (F3).
They are entered as:
.in5
.sp
.br
&ds Hl headingleft (H1)
.br
&ds Hm headingleft (H2)
.br
&ds Hn headingleft (H3)
.br
&ds Ho headingleft (H4)
.br
&ds Hp headingleft (H5)
.br
&ds Hr headingright (H1)
.br
&ds Hs headingright (H2)
.br
&ds Ht headingright (H3)
.br
&ds Hu headingright (H4)
.br
&ds Hv headingright (H5)
.br
&ds Fl footingleft  (F3)
.br
&ds Fr footingright (F3)
.br
&ds Fd footingdate  (F1  the date is automatically inserted here)
.PP
Ordinarily three blank lines will appear at the top of the page before
the heading is printed and one blank line after the heading.
These vertical margins can be adjusted by:
.in5
.sp
.br
&nr Ha x
.br
&nr Hb x
.PP
where "Ha" represents the vertical margin above the header, "Hb" the
vertical margin below the header, and "x" represents a number value.
Vertical margins for the footer are adjusted by:
.sp
.in5
.br
&nr Fa x
.br
&nr Fb x
.PP
The preset values are {.nr~Ha~3} {.nr~Hb~1} {.nr~Fa~1} {.nr~Fb~3}.
To get the maximum number of printed lines on a page
set Ha and Fb to zero.
.PP
Note that a bug exists in the line printer driver which overrides adjustment
of the vertical margin above the header (Ha).
When using the
.I "line printer,"
leading blank lines at the top of the page are suppressed.
The leading blank lines you see are caused by the form feed.
The line printer prints only 60 lines per page.
.PH "SIMPLE~PARAGRAPHS"
Simple paragraphs are made by typing
.sp
.ti5
.br
&PP [indent] [line spacing]
.PP
where "indent" is the value for indenting the
.I first
line of the paragraph.
"Line spacing" represents the number of lines (minus one)
to skip before beginning the paragraph.
The preset values are no indentation and double spacing {.PP 0 2}.
Note that the first line may be indented but the body always has zero indentation.
This is useful in returning to zero indentation from lists and bullet items.
.PH "PARAGRAPHS~WITH~HEADINGS"
Paragraphs with headings can be made by typing
.sp
.ti5
.br
&PH [heading] [indent] [ls to heading] [ls heading to text]
.br
.ti9
[font] [assigned format]
.PP
where "heading" is the value to appear as heading for the paragraph.
The paragraph heading is separated from the previous text by the
"ls~to~heading" value.
It is separated from the paragraph text by the "ls~heading~to~text" value.
The "indent" option indents
.I only
the line containing the paragraph heading.
Indention of the body is always set to zero.
The "font" option applies only to the heading
(0~or~1~=~roman, 2~=~italic, 3~=~bold).
.PP
A counter (N0) counts the number of paragraphs with headings.
Normally this count is not displayed.
Placing a value in the "assigned format" option causes the count to appear
with the heading.
Preset values are {.PH "" 0 2 2 0 ""}.
.PP
The .P1, .P2, .P3, .P4, .P5, .P6 macros only have one option.  They all
follow this style;
.sp
.ti5
.br
&P1 [heading]
.PP
where "heading" is the value to appear as the heading for the numbered
paragraph.  The spacing between paragraph headings is as follows;
.sp
.I ~~~~~~~~~Macro~~~~~~Spacing
.br
	P1         2 blank lines
.br
	P2,P3      1 blank line
.br
	P4,P5,P6   no spacing at all
.PP
Using paragraphs with P4, P5, or P6 will give the heading on the
same line as the beginning of the paragraph.
.PH LISTS
There are six levels of lists available~-- L1,~L2,~L3,~L4,~L5,~and~L6.
The format for the L1 list is
.sp
.ti5
.br
&L1 [indent] [line spacing] [assigned format]
.br
.ti5
    [left string] [right string]
.br
.ti9
(followed by one or more lines of text)
.PP
Each item of the L1 list must be preceded by an ".L1" line.
The value in the "line spacing" option determines the spacing between the
previous text and the new item of the list.
The "indent" value determines the indentation of the L1 list.
Numbering of the list is done automatically.
The type of numbering used depends upon the "assigned format" value.
The "left string" value is the string of characters preceding the list number.
The "right string" value is the string of characters to be used between the list
number and the item, usually
".~~" (period space space).
The preset values for the L1 list are {.L1 8 1 1 "" ".$$"}.
.PP
The L2 list has exactly the same format as the L1 list
but contains preset values of {.L2~8~1~a~""~".$$"}.
This results in alphabetic numbering and indentation four more spaces to the right.
Note that using tildes ($) in these string options insures exact spacing
around the list numbers. The other levels have the following preset values;
{.L3~8~1~\\(bu~""~".$$"}, {.L4~8~1~\\(sq~""~".$$"}, {.L5~8~1~I~""~".$$"},
and {.L6~8~1~A~""~".$$"}.
.PP
The assigned formats may be changed in the .L1 - .L6 line by typing a
I, A, 1, a, i, \\(bu, or \\(sq as the fourth parameter.
.PH ENDING LISTS
The macros ".E1" through ".E6" can be used to end lists L1 through L6
respectively.
The lists are also ended automatically by the paragraphs with headings
(.PH and .P1-.P6 macros) and by new items of higher level lists.
This table summarizes the macros which end lists.
.sp
.I "	LIST	ENDED BY"
.br
	L1      .PH .E1 .P1 - .P6
.br
	L2      .PH .E2 .L1 .P1 - .P6

.br
	L6      .PH .E6 .L5 .L4 .L3 .L2 .L1 .P1 - .P6
.PH BULLET~ITEM
.in5
.br
&BU [indent]
.PP
"Indent" is the number of blanks placed in front of the bullet.
Text remains indented until changed.
Note that because .PP and .PH always set the indentation to zero,
an ".in" command following a bullet item is usually unnecessary.
Preset to {.BU 10}.

   This example illustrates the use of:

	   o+ heading and footing options

	   o+ underlining

	   o+ using a list command to make a bullet  item  --  No-
	     tice how the  text continues  to stay  indented  at the
	     same margin.  xxxxx  xxxx xxxxxxxx xx x xxxxxxxx xxxxxx
	     xxxx xxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxx.

	     An ".sp" command will cause  a  blank  line  but  won't
	     return  the  indentation  to  zero.   xxxxxx xxx xxxxxxxx
	     xxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxx xxxx xxxxxx xxxxx.

   A ".PP" or ".PH" causes indentation to return to zero.   Of  course
   the ".in" command can be used also.

&PH "INDENTED$PARAGRAPHS"
	Indented paragraphs are easy to make.
These paragraphs have an indentation of eight spaces.
This paragraph was made with {.PH "INDENTED%PARAGRAPHS"}.
The tab key was hit before the first word of this paragraph.
Eight spaces could be used instead of a tab but that is too much trouble.
&PP 8
Indented paragraphs are easier to make when there is no heading.
This paragraph was made by the setting {.PP 8}.
Once this setting is made, then only a simple ".PP" is necessary.

&PH "Setting$the$indentation$option$on$.PH" 8
This paragraph was formed with a new .PH setting.
The setting is
@{.PH$"Setting%the%indentation%option%on%.PH"$8}.
Notice that only the heading line is indented.
To indent the first line of the paragraph in this case, you still
have to put a tab or spaces in front of the first word.
&PH
When no heading is given on a .PH request you get a blank heading,
as this paragraph shows.
xxxxxx xxxxx xxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxx xxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxx.
xxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxx.
&PH "If$line$spacing" 8 2 0
between the heading and the text is set to zero in a .PH request,
then the heading will be put on the first line of the paragraph.
This is called "run-in text".
When the indentation option on .PH is combined with run-in text
(i.e., no blank lines between paragraph heading and text),
then you can get indented paragraphs with the .PH command without
having to put tabs or spaces in front of the first paragraph line.
The setting used for this paragraph is
@{.PH$"If%line%spacing"$8$2$0}.

   INDENTED PARAGRAPHS

	   Indented paragraphs are easy to make.   These  paragraphs
   have  an indentation of eight spaces.  This paragraph was made with
   {.PH "INDENTED$PARAGRAPHS"}.  The tab  key  was  hit  before  the

   of a tab but that is too much trouble.

	   Setting the indentation option on .PH

   This paragraph was formed with a new .PH setting.  The setting is
   {.PH "Setting$the$indentation$option$on$.PH" 8}.   Notice that only
   the heading line is indented.  To indent the first  line  of  the
   paragraph  in this case, you still have to put a tab or spaces in
   front of the first word.



   When no heading is given on a .PH request you get a  blank  head-
   ing,  as  this paragraph shows.  xxxxxx xxxxx xxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxx
   xxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxx xxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxx.  xxxx  xxxxxxxx  xxxxxx
   xxxxxx xxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxx.

	   If line spacing  between the heading and the text is  set
   to  zero  in  a  .PH request, then the heading will be put on the
   first line of the paragraph.  This is called "run-in text".  When
   the  indentation  option on .PH is combined with run-in text (i.e.,
   no blank lines between paragraph heading and text), then you  can
   get  indented  paragraphs  with the .PH command without having to
   put tabs or spaces in front of the  first  paragraph  line.   The
   setting used for this paragraph is {.PH "If~line~spacing" 8 2 0}.
