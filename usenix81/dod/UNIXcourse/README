     Welcome to Introduction to UNIX, the book  which  introduces
its readers to the wild and wonderful world of the UNIX operating
systems. The arrangement of the text is quite simple,  there  are
four  units:  the  unit number is indicated by first digit of the
number which follows the word unit,  and  the  module  number  is
indicated  by  the  second digit. In each unit there is a chapter
test, for which answers  are  provided.  Each  unit  also  has  a
proficiency  test, which along with a critique sheet is contained
in the last section of the unit. In addition to the four units of
text  there  is  a  final exam and a course manager's manual. The
manual includes the answers to  the  proficiency  tests  and  the
final exam.

     To gain access to this masterpiece all  one  has  to  do  is
execute  the  Print  file.  Entering  Print  and  help or null as
arguments will cause a list of valid arguments to the Print  file
to be displayed.

     Unfortunately, there might be a few complications. The files
that  constitute  the learning package embody the new (V7) nroff,
which may not be a feature of your  Unix  system.  Also,  the  NM
macro  package  has  been  employed in constructing the files and
constitutes a topic of discussion in the course material  itself.
This  too might not be a feature of your system. To ease problems
of  incompatibility  the  NM  macro  package  and  the  available
documentation relating to it have been included.

     There  is  one  way  of  getting  around  the  compatability
problem.  In  addition to the "executable" files containing nroff
and macro commands the directory contains  "pre-formatted"  files
containing  the  various constituent parts of the document. These
are the files prefixed by the term "sav". The pre-formatted files
can be sent directly to a line printer by using the Print command
with "print" as an argument.

     Another potential problem is presented by the  size  of  the
the  learning  package.  In  its entirety it amounts to over 2000
blocks of memory and 250 pages of printed  output.  Printing  the
entire document might pose a problem for your line printer.

     Because the course was designed to meet the needs of the DOD
user  it  makes  use  of  many features which are specific to DOD
systems and software. The task of  achieving  compatability  with
your   own   systems   and   software   is   naturally  your  own
responsibility.  Accordingly,  we  at   DOD   will   not   accept
responsibility  for  any problems encountered in implementing and
employing this UNIX learning package.

Mildred Ware wrote  this  course.   Eleanor  Risher  and  friends
entered  it  into  the  system.  Susan Costello worked on it. Tom
Leary worked, and worked, and worked, ..., getting it into final,
final, final shape.  Sharon Oom and Dennis Mumaugh checked it for
technical accuracy.
