.sh DESCRIPTION
This package is a superset of the "em" macro set, corrected to work
with Version 7
.it nroff.
.s3
This package of
.it nroff
macro definitions provides a canned formatting
facility for memoranda, letters, lists and other informal documents.
This package is used either by supplying the argument
.it -mnm
with
.it nroff
and
.it troff
commands or by placing the following line in the text file:
.s3
.lp +8 0
.nf
.li
.so /usr/lib/tmac.nm
.fi
.i0
.s3
Headings, footings, and classification are entered as string macros in the form
.s3
.lp +8 0
.nf
.li
.ds AA c
.s3
.fi
.i0
where "AA" represents the macro and "c" is a character string.
All string macros are preset to null, except F1, which is set to "- % -"
to produce page numbers, and Fd which is set to \\*(DY to produce the
current date on the right of the page numbers.  If the date is not
wanted, do a
.s3
.nf
.lp +8 0
.li
.ds Fd
.i0
.s3
.fi
at the beginning of the file.
Classification is placed at the top and bottom of pages, in accordance
with DOD rules. It is obtained by
.s3
.lp +8 0
.nf
.li
.ds CL classification
.i0
.br
.fi
.s3
It can be used for purposes other than security, of course.
.s3
Vertical margins above and below headings and footings are adjusted by
number registers.
Setting Ha and Fb to zero maximizes the printing on a page.
.s3
There are three font macros:
.li
.R~(roman), .I~(italic), and .B~(bold).
Their format is
.s3
.lp +8 0
.nf
.li
.A [string]
.fi
.i0
.s3
where "A" represents the font macro and "string" is a character string.
If a string is given, only the string is affected.
If a string is not given, the printing enters the "A" mode until changed.
Note that when using nroff bold and italic printing is converted to underlining.
.s3
Paragraphing is done with .PP, .PH, and .P1 - .P6 with the forms
.s3
.lp +8 0
.nf
.li
.PP [indent] [line spacing]
.fi
.i0
.s3
where "line spacing" represents the number of lines (minus one) to skip
before beginning the paragraph.
"Indent" is the value for indenting the
first line of the paragraph.
Indention of the paragraph body is always zero.
The preset values are double spacing and no indentation {.PP 0 2}.
.s3
.lp +8 0
.li
.PH [heading] [indent] [ls to heading]
[ls heading to text] [font] [assigned format]
.fi
.i0
.s3
where "heading" is the value to appear as heading for the paragraph.
The paragraph heading is separated from the previous text by the
"ls~to~heading" value and
from the paragraph text by the "ls~heading~to~text" value.
The "indent" option indents
.it only
the line containing the paragraph heading.
Indention of the paragraph body and list counters are
set to zero.
The "font" option applies only to the heading
(0~or~1~=~roman, 2~=~italic, 3~=~bold).
.s3
A counter (N0) counts the number of paragraphs with headings.
Placing a value in the "assigned format" option causes the count to appear
with the heading.
Preset values are {.PH "" 0 2 2 0 ""}.
.s3
.lp +8 0
.nf
.li
.P1 [heading]
.br
.fi
.i0
.s3
where "heading" is the string to appear as heading for the
paragraph.  The paragraph heading is separated from the previous text
as follows:
.nf
.lp +8 0
.tr ~
.li 4
		P1       by 2 blank lines
		P2-P3    by 1 blank line
		P4-P6    no spacing ( paragraph begins on same line
		~        as heading )
.fi
.i0
.sp
There are 6 levels -  a P1 line would give a heading number like:
.br
.nf
.lp +8 0
.li
		1.

.fi
.ne 2
.i0
and a P6 might give a heading number like:
.br
.nf
.lp +8 0
.li
		3.1.2.4.1.2.

.fi
.i0
.s3
It is possible to change the format of the numbered headings used
in .P1-.P6 by using the .af command.  The registers aa through ff refer
to P1 through P6 respectively.  The sequence
.ne 5
.br
.nf
.lp +8 0
.li 2
		.af bb A
		.P2 "heading"
.br
.i0
would produce
.br
.lp +8 0
.li
		1.A.  heading.
.fi
.i0
Any of these registers can have its format reassigned in this way.
.i0
.s3
There are six levels of lists available~--~L1,~L2,~L3,~L4, L5,~and~L6.
The format for the L1 list is
.s3
.lp +8 0
.li
.L1 [indent] [line spacing] [assigned format]
[left string] [right string]
.br
    (followed by one or more lines of text)
.i0
.s3
Each item of the L1 list must be preceded by an ".L1" line.
The value in the "line spacing" option determines the spacing between the
previous text and the new item of the list.
The "indent" value determines the indention of the L1 list.
Numbering of the list is done automatically.
The type of numbering used depends upon the "assigned format" value.
The "left string" value is the string of characters preceding the list number.
The "right string" value is the string of characters to be used between the list
number and the item, usually 
".~~" (period space space).
The preset values for the L1 list are
{.L1~8~1~1~""~".$$"}.
The tilde ($) translates as a space.
.s3
All the rest of the levels have the same format as the L1 list
but contain different assigned formats.
The following is a list of default assigned formats:
.nf
.lp +8 0
.li 6
 L1     1
 L2     a
 L3     \\(bu
 L4     \\(sq
 L5     I
 L6     A
.fi
.i0
.s3
The \\(bu and \\(sq print as \(bu and \(sq respectively.
.s3
The assigned format for any list level can be changed to any allowable
format (including \\(bu and \\(sq ), using the .L1 - .L6 commands.
If the assigned format is \\(bu or \\(sq the left and right
strings are not print.
.s3
Lists L1, L2, L3, L4, L5, L6 are ended by .E1, .E2, .E3, .E4, .E5, .E6,
respectively.
They are also ended by paragraphs with headings
(.PH and .P1-.P6 macros) and by new items of higher level lists.
Note that .PH, .PP, and .P1-.P6  return indentions to zero.
To adjust line spacing between items of a list, use list options.
To adjust line spacing within the same list item and maintain indention,
use ".sp".
.s3
There is a table of contents capability.  Each numbered paragraph heading
named by P1 - P6 is saved in a table of contents macro.  To print the
table of contents at the end of your file just do a  .TC  as your
last nroff command.  The .PH paragraph headings are
.bd not
remembered.
