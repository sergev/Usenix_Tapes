Upon completion of this module you will be able to:
.sp
.L1 5 2 1
Receive messages from other users.
.L1
Send messages to other users and yourself.

.bp
.PH "Message~commmand"
.PP
Unix has its own postal system so you can
send and receive letters from other users of the
system.
.PP
All users are given what is called a MAIL
file; the system uses this file to maintain  letters
or messages sent to you.
.PP
Upon logging in you may sometimes see this
message displayed:
.ti 20
You have mail
.sp
This means that someone has sent you a message and
the system has placed it in your MAIL file.
.PH "Reading~your~mail"
.PP
To read your mail, issue the command,
.sp
.ti 20
% msg <return>
.sp
This gives you access to your MAIL file.  Upon entering this
command, the system will respond by displaying:
.sp
.in 8

.br
-->
.in -8
.sp
.PP
The first of the  displayed lines indicates the
name of the program used, the release no., and the
revision date. The second and third lines depict
message header lines, which consist of the following
information:
.sp
.in 10
<message no.> <no. of characters> <date sent>
.sp
<login name of sender> <subject of message>
.sp
3ti -10
Example:
.br
1 107 char 24 Jan 1978 mmw leave
.sp
.in -10
.PP
If the sender didn't specify a subject, ??? will be
displayed.
.PP
The fourth line lets you know the number of messages
contained in your file, and the fifth line instructs you
to type a "?" to obtain help in using the program. The
"-->" indicates the system is ready to accept input, one
of the Message program commands --- these commands will be
discussed shortly.
.PP
While you are using this program the system will display
the "-->" as the input prompt character instead of the "%".
.PH "Seeking~help"
If you type:
.ti 20
? <return>
.sp
the system will display the following list of commands that
may be issued while using the Message program :
.sp
.in 10

.sp
t[ype] <message no> ...
.sp
q[uit]
.sp
.in -10
<message no > is of the form [number] [:[number]]
.sp
Examples: 2 is 2, 2:4 is 2 through 4, 2: is 2 to the end,
:~is everything, "a" means ALL messages, "u" means
undeleted messages, and "d" means DELETED messages.

Note: Several other commands involving the use of files
will also be displayed. However, we are going to
focus our attention on only the above commands
until file manipulation has been discussed.
If the b,d,h,n, or t commands are issued and your
mail file contains 0 messages, the system's response
is: --> no file. This indicates that your Mail file is empty.

.PH "Displaying~messages"
.PP
The "t" command is used to display messages that have
been placed in your MAIL file.  Several variations of this
command may be used.  Let's take a look at these now.
.sp
.L1
To display all the messages in your file, you have
a choice of using either of the following two
forms:
.sp
.in +5
(a)~type:~~~~~~t~a~~~<return>
.br
~~~~response:~~~-->~type~all~messages
.sp
(b)~type:~~~~~~t~:~~<return>
.br
~~~~response:~~~-->~type :
.sp
.in -5
Following either of these commands, the system will
display all the messages you have in your file.
.sp
.ne 10
.in +9
.ti -9
Notes:~1~The system will also display messages deleted
in this session. The deleted messages are displayed
with an "*" beside the message number in the header.
.br
.ti -9
~~~~~~~2~Response refers to the information displayed by
the system.
.in -9
.L1
Suppose you accidentally deleted a message before
you read it, and you don't wish to view all the
messages in your file, what then? Never fear --- Unix
is here. Unix allows you to display recently deleted
messages by using:
.sp
.ti +15
t~d~~~~<return>
.ti +7
response: --> type deleted messages
.sp
The system will now display only the messages which
you have deleted during this session.
.L1
You also have another option. If you want to read or
review only the mail which is to remain in your file,
you can do so by typing,
.sp
.ti +15
t~u~~~~<return>
.sp
.ti +7
response: type undeleted messages
.sp
This directs the system to display only the messages
which have not been deleted.
.E1
.PH "Deleting~messages"
.PP
As you have probably surmised, you may delete
messages from your MAIL file. This eliminates a
cluttered file and saves time in accessing the Message
program. Therefore, when you use the mail file you
should delete a message after reading it, unless it
contains some pertinent information that should be kept
for later reference. A message is deleted by typing:
.sp
.ti 20
d <message no>
.sp
where "d" initiates the delete command and "<message no>" is
the number of the message to be deleted.
.sp
Examples:
.sp
.L1
~~~~type: d 2 <return>
.br
response:  --> delete 2
.br
Will delete message number 2.
.L1
~~~~type: d 2:4 <return>
.br
response:  -->
.br
Will delete messages 2 thru  4
.sp
.ne 10
.L1
~type d
.br
response:   -->
.br
Will delete the "current" message.
.br
or,
.br
type d a
.br
response:   --> delete all messages
.br
Will delete all messages from your MAIL file.
.E1
.PH "Other commands"
.in 3
.ti -3
1. h[eaders] <message no>
.sp
The system will display the header information for the
specified message(s). If the message number is omitted, the
header line of the last referenced (current) message will
be displayed. If "a" replaces the message number, the header
information for all messages will be displayed.
.ti -3
.sp 2
2. n[ext message is:]
.sp
The message assigned the next highest number to the
current message is displayed.
.sp 2
.ti -3
3. b[acking up to:]
.sp

displayed.
.PH "Exiting~the~Message~program"
.PP
Now that you have read your mail and discarded the
messages for which you have no future use,
the next step is to leave the Message program to
return to the command level.
There are three commands which can be used; these are:
.sp
.in 3
.ti -3
1.~s[ave mail and exit]
.sp
This is really a misnomer. It does cause you to exit
the Message program  but does not save your mail, i.e.,
your mail will not be retained in your MAIL file. The
Save command will move all undeleted messages from your MAIL
file and place them in a backup file called "savemail."
This is the usual option if you don't want to collect mail
in one mail file. Later on you can look at the file SAVEMAIL
to recall old messages.
.sp
.ne 10
.in +13
To use,
.sp
type:~~~~~~~~~s
.br
response:~~~~-->~~save[confirm]
.in -13
The system expects you to enter either a 'y' for yes, or
an 'n' for no. If an 'n' is entered, the command will be
ignored and you remain in the Message program .
.sp 2
.ti -3
2.~q[uit]
.sp
Causes you to exit the Message program but does not
perform any updating; i.e., your MAIL file remains in its
original state. Your file will not be modified to
reflect any of the deletions you made.
.sp 2
.ti -3
3.~e[xit and update]
.sp
Causes you to exit the message program and to update
your MAIL file. Any message you deleted while using the
Message program will be removed from your MAIL file.
The response to this command will be:
.sp
.ti +5
exit and update file  <filename> [confirm]
.sp
As with the save command, you must enter a 'y' if you
want this command executed.
.in -3
.sp 2
.in 6
.ti -6
Note:~After execution of any of the above three
commands, the system will display the prompt (%)
indicating that it is ready to accept another
command.
Please note that each of these commands
performs a different function. Please
review the exit command if you can not discern the
differences between them.

.PH "Sending~messages"
.PP
As previously mentioned, the system also allows you
to send messages.  These messages may be sent to other
users or to yourself. You may also send the same
message to several users simultaneously.
.PP
When a message is sent to someone, the system will
place the message in that person's MAIL file.
The command used to send a message is:
.ti 25
sndmsg
.PP
This command is very simple to use, because the "sndmsg" program
issues several prompts to guide you in using the program.
Examples:
.sp
.in 15
.ti -6
Type:~sndmsg
.sp
.ti -10
Response:~TO:
.sp
.ti -6
Type:~<the login name(s) of the primary receiver(s)
of the message>
.sp
.ti -10
Response:~cc:
.sp
.ti -6
Type:~<the login names of other persons to receive
the message> If more than one login name is
used, separate each by a comma.
If there are no such users to receive the
message, just depress the "RETURN" key. If
more than one line is needed to specify all
receivers, end the first line with a comma
and continue on the next line.
.sp
.ti -10
Response:~Subject:
.sp
.ti -6
Type:~< what the message pertains to> This may be
a single word, a phrase, or it could be
you needn't specify a subject. If the
latter, then depress the RETURN key.

Entering the "send" or "queue" commands causes you to
exit the SNDMSG program.  The system will respond with:
.sp

If you send a message to a person on another computer
or system other than the one you are logged in on, the
"sndmsg" command requires a little more information.
In addition to specifying the login-name of the receiver,
you must also specify the system he is logged in on. For
example, you are on the ELROND system and you wish to send a
message to "hdd" on  the CARONA system.  When you receive
the prompt   TO:  you would type:
.sp

The "write" command provides a means of establishing
a two-way communication path.
This is accomplished by typing:
.sp
.ti 20
write <login name>
.sp
where <login name> is the login name of the user you
wish to contact.
.PP
When the "write" command is issued, the system will
prompt the specified user by a startling beep and the
message:
.sp
.ti 20
message from <your login name>
.sp
Then the specified user would respond by typing:
.ti 20
.sp
write <your login name>
.PP
The two-way communication path has been established.
Now whatever you type on your termimal will appear on
the specified user's terminal, and whatever the
specified user types will appear on your terminal. That
is, until you enter <ctrl-d> which ends the communication
path.

get acquainted by writing.
.PH "Remind Command"
.PP
The "remind" command is also used to send
messages. However,  we call these messages
reminders, because you can specify the time
the message is to be sent.
You may specify that the reminder is to be
sent today, tomorrow, next week, next month,
or several months from now.
This command has several options (referred
to as arguments) which may be used or omitted
and has the following form:
..sp
remind <user> ... <mo/da/yr> <hr:min> <-r"reminder">
.sp
~~~~~Example: remind mmw 2/4/78 2:30pm -r"It's 2:30"
.PP
The above would cause the system to prompt
user mmw on February 4th at 2:30pm by
displaying the reminder accompanied by a
loud beep, e.g.:
.sp

the message will be delivered on the 20th
day of this month. Thus, when any of the
fields is omitted, the system assumes you
are referring to the current month, day,
or year. Consequently, you may omit this
argument entirely.
.sp
.ul
Relative~date~specification:
.sp
~~~~~The fields may be also preceded by a
plus sign. If so, it is taken to be
relative to the current month, day, or
year; e.g. /+1 means "tomorrow." I if the
current date is 4/24/78, 5/+9 means the
reminder will be delivered on June 2nd,
since May, the 5th month, has 31 days.
.sp
~~~~~Ok, you do this one. If the current
date is 3/9/78, and you enter 6/+4 as the
argument, what date will the reminder be
delivered?
.sp 2
~~~~~If you said 6/13/78, good, that's correct.
Suppose you try another. The current date
is 2/3/78, and you enter /+10, when will
the reminder be delivered?
.sp 2
~~~~~Is your answer 2/13/78? If not, please
review this section.

<hr:min>---------The time of the day that the reminder is to be
delivered is specified in this form, where
hr  and min are whole numbers. Either of the
two fields (fields being separated by ":"
this time) may be omitted; if the colon is
missing, the minute field is assumed to be
zero .
.sp
.ne 10
~~~~~The time may be specified on the basis of
24 hour clock (0800) or the usual convention
(8am, 8:00, 8, 8:00am). Any of these forms
is acceptable.
.sp
.ul
Relative~time~specification:
.sp
~~~~~Either field may be preceded by a plus
sign. The time is then taken to be relative to
to the time the "Remind"  command is issued. Thus,
if the command is issued at 1:30pm on 2/4/78,
and the time is entered as +1:15pm the
message is sent at 2:45 on the specified date.
As you can see, the reminder is sent 1 hour
and 15 minutes after the command was issued.
.sp
~~~~~Ok, here is one for you. The time is 9:10am and +:10
is specified as the time. When will the reminder
be sent?
.sp 2

it wasn't, please review this section.

<-r"reminder">---"-r" is a part of the format and must
used; your message or reminder is typed enclosed
within double-quote marks. Do not space between
"-r" and the reminder. Also, the reminder can not
be continued to another line.  If you wish to
send a longer reminder, just omit the <-r"reminder">
completely, type your message starting on
the next line and end it  with <ctrl-d>.
