These contributions are in daily use at Geotronics Corporation.
Some of them are fairly simple, but you might find them useful anyway.
Many of these goodies are not needed by 7th Edition UNIX sites.
There are "Read_Me" files in the subdirectories to explain what's what.

The source files here require some minor modifications to a modern C
compiler, or you can easily edit the source code into standard form.
To avoid hassles, I have not included standard UNIX /usr/include files.
See "hlp/c_news.hlp" for further information about the differences.
