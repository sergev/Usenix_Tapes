				HELP FOR "ttyset"


"ttyset" is a utility program that you can invoke in your ".profile"
login command file to set the appropriate characteristics for your
terminal.  Currently, "ttyset" sets /dev/tty1 up as a VT100,
/dev/ttyh as a Versabraille, and all other lines up as an ADM3A.
Backspace (Control H) and Control U are the character erase and line
kill characters, respectively.  (These are now standard anyway.)

"ttyset" replaces the earlier "adm3a" and "vt100" shell command files.
