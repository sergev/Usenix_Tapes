This tree contains versions of ?roff and ?eqn which have been modified
(several times!) to drive the Sanders Technology Media 12/7 printer.
While there are more than enough things wrong with the Sanders, with
the help of this software, it will do yeoman's duty generating very
nice documents.  It is no typesetter, (it can't do 96-point sigmas and
integral signs) but for less ambitious text it is an order of magnitude
better than daisy/thimble printers.  The accompanying document is a
good example.

As far as we can tell, the hacking order goes:

	Patrick Orr, New Mexico Tech.
	Jeremy Epstein, University of New Mexico
	Stanly Steinberg, University of New Mexico

	later,
	Mike O'Dell, Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory

	And finally,
	much modified by Mike Karels, Dept. of Molecular Biology,
	University of California, Berkeley

The three fellows in NM made NROFF run on the Sanders.  Mike Karels
must be given credit as major author of this version.  Mike has put
several TROFF type features into SROFF, including, proportional spacing
and emboldening.

This version was running on a 11/40 at UCB and was ported to a VAX back
at LBL.  Our Sanders here at LBL has more fonts than Mike's does, so we
did most of the font tables beyond the H10 set.

Questions can be directed to either of the following, but we can't make
any promises about anything, other than gladly accepting any bug fixes
generated elsewhere.

Good luck.
