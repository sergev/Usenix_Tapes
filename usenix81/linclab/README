These files consist mostly of changes to basic V7
UNIX which we would like to see fed back to BELL,
BERKELEY, or USGS so we did not have to maintain
them ourselves.  It would be quite alright to change
the form of these enhancements if the capabilities
were preserved.

make	A lot of enhancements for maintaining more complex
	systems, and in particular maintaining many sets of
	binaries for one set of sources.  Enhancements are
	documented at the end of the make.1 manual entry.

pr	Enhancements to make it a better file print formatter.
	It is used in the lpf shell file, which is included
	although undocumented just to indicate usage of pr.

col	Ditto for printing manual sections.  Tmac.p* files
	illustrate usage.  Our nroff has been modified to
	accept a whole shell line rather than just a
	bin file name in its .pi.

cpp	We would like to have, but do not have, a much more
	advanced cpp.  A memo, cpp.81, is included for
	comment, to stimulate interest, etc.
