The directory dev contains device handlers for:
	dz      our modification of a handler we got from somewhere;
		we're using it now; have not used modem support yet;
	rx      single density floppy handler designed from scratch;
		we used it extensively in the past but no longer;
	xy      incremental plotter interface designed from scratch;
		debugged on it but never used it with a plotter;
	hm      handler for a System Industries Fujitsu 160Mbyte
		winchester disk with their 9400 controller in
		"extended" emulation mode; we modified the hp handler
		to work with this "double-sized" RM03; we're using
		it now; have not encountered any disk errors yet;

The directory mdec contains boot loaders for:
	hm      SI 160Mbyte winchester; we're using it now;
	rx      floppy disk; debugged on it but never used it; it is
		actually still a little to big to use;

The directory lib contains some miscellaneous subroutines:
	cscan   recognizes the usual character constant syntax: \nnn, etc.
	ls      lists a directory into a specified buffer and sorts it
	match   pattern matches the usual ed/grep regular expressions

The directory s1 contains some miscellaneous programs:
	echo    modified it to use cscan;
	ls      modified it to list directories recursively, depth first;
		none of the other ls switches were broken; it works nicely;
	chaos   redirect the output of this program to a friend's ADM-3A
		terminal while he/she is editing for an interesting
		reaction (e.g., "Oh no! My terminal got the measles!");
	rtpip   our program to create, update, squeeze, etc., an RT file
		system in a unix (special) file; we use it a good deal
		and have not encountered any problems;
	r       our program to run RT executable programs under unix;
		we use it to run RT Fortran, Basic, Macro, Link and it
		works very well; installation requires a new system call;
		documentation is poor (virtually non-existent)
