.sh NAME
hm \*- RH-11/RM03+ SI Fujitsu 160Mb winchester disk
.sh DESCRIPTION
The System Industries Fujistu 160Mb winchester disk drive is interfaced to
the system via a controller which emulates a ``super RM03'', i.e.,
one that has 10 tracks per cylinder instead of the usual 5.  The
controller is configured to operate in ``extended emulation'' mode
(switches 1,2,4, and 8 of U612 on the drive interface board are ON,
and the front panel mode switch is set to EXT).
.s3
The files
.it "hm0 ... hm7"
refer to sections of SI disk drive 0.
The files
.it "hm8 ... hm15"
refer to drive 1 etc.
This is done since the size of
a full SI drive is 263,360 blocks and
internally the system is only capable
of addressing 65536
blocks.
Also since the disk is so large,
this allows it to be broken up
into more manageable pieces.
.s3
The origin and size of the pseudo-disks on each drive are
as follows:
.s3
.br
	disk    start   length
.br
	0       0       64000
.br
	1       64000   64000
.br
	2       135360  64000
.br
	3       199360  64000
.br
	4       128000  7360
.br
	5       unused
.br
	6       unused
.br
	7       unused
.s3
These files are non-overlapping and all exist simultaneously.
Disk 0 contains the root file system and the other large disks
contain mountable file systems.  Disk 4 is used for swapping.
.s3
The
.it hm
files
access the disk via the system's normal
buffering mechanism
and may be read and written without regard to
physical disk records.
There is also a ``raw'' interface
which provides for direct transmission between the disk
and the user's read or write buffer.
A single read or write call results in exactly one I/O operation
and therefore raw I/O is considerably more efficient when
many words are transmitted.
The names of the raw devices
begin with
.it rhm
and end with a number which selects the same disk
section as the corresponding
.it hm
file.
.s3
In raw I/O the buffer must begin on a word boundary,
and counts should be a multiple of 512 bytes
(a disk block).
Likewise
.it seek
calls should specify a multiple of 512 bytes.
