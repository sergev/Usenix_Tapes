.sh NAME
rx - RX01 floppy disk
.sh DESCRIPTION
Devices rx0 and rx1 refer to floppy drives 0 and 1 with I/O done in the DEC RT
style using 2:1 sector interleave and 6 sector skew between tracks.  There are
494 blocks available for storage because track 0 is left unused.
.sp1
Devices rx2 and rx3 refer to floppy drives 0 and 1 with I/O done using no sector
mapping, i.e., 4 consecutive sectors make up a block and sector 1 of track n+1
follows sector 26 of track n.  All 77 tracks are used giving 500 blocks for
storage (actually 500.5).

.sh BUGS
There is no raw device (it would only be useful when writing a sector at a time-
there would be no speed advantage since program loop I/O is done).
