.sh NAME
xy - incremental plotter interface
.sh DESCRIPTION
Xy is a write only device which controls the movement of the pen of an incremental
plotter.  Each byte written controls the pen according to the following bit
assignments:
.in+4
01  step in positive x direction
.br
02  step in negative x direction
.br
04  step in positive y direction
.br
010 step in negative y direction
.br
020 put pen down
.br
040 lift pen up
.br
.in-4
non-conflicting motions may be 'or'ed together in a single byte.  In addition to
pen commands the following codes perform special functions:
.in+4
0200  eject a page (the page size is a handler variable)
.br
0201  jam the pen to the left edge (+y) of the plotter
.br
0202  jam the pen to the right edge (-y) of the plotter
.br
0203  set the current position as the reference y
.br
.ti+6
coordinate position
.in-4
.sp1
The pen is raised when xy or rxy is opened.  A side effect of jamming the pen
with xy is that y step commands are subsequently counted to limit inadvertent
jams against either edge.  When an eject is given an integral number of pages ae
rolled out (to include the whole plot should it span more than one page) and the
pen is moved to the reference y position.  If no reference was specified then the
position at the start is used.
