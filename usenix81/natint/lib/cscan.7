.sh SYNOPSIS
cscan(s,cp)
.br
.ti+6
char *s,*cp;
.br
.sh DESCRIPTION
Cscan reads the string,s, and returns the next character in cp.  It decodes the
standard syntax using the backslash:
.in+4
"\\n" is converted to a newline
.br
"\\r" to a carriage return
.br
"\\b" to a backspace
.br
"\\t" to a tab
.br
"\\p" to a form feed
.br
"\\s" to a space
.br
"\\\\"  to a backslash
.br
"\\nnn" to the character whose octal representation is nnn (nnn may be one, two,
or three octal digits)
.br
.in-4
.sp1
All other characters are passed unchanged.  Cscan returns the number of characters
of s that were consumed in producing the character at *cp.
