.sh DESCRIPTION
Ndirent returns the number of directory entries in the directory
named d.  It returns -1 if an error occurred trying to open the directory.
.sp1
Ls reads a directory named d and returns the number of entries listed.  Each
buffer pointed to by ep[i] must be at least 15 bytes long.  File names are
stored at ep[] as null terminated strings.  Ls returns -1 if an error occurred
trying to open the directory.
.sp1
Both ndirent and ls ignore file names which begin with '.' unless the global
variable ls_all is set to a non-zero value.
.sp1
Ls calls qsort and scompare to sort the entries; sorting is accomplished by
permuting the pointers in ep[].
