I regret the lack of documentation for this program, however it
does appear to work reasonably well.  It was developed over a very
short period of time using stream-of-consciousness programming
techniques, so the code may be hard to follow in places.

Installation requires a system modification to add something like
the setwin() system call provided here along with the corresponding
mods to trap.c.

We are able to run RT Fortran, Basic, Macro, Link, etc. with no problems,
in addition to RT application programs.  One notable exception is
the adventure program under RT -- an unresolved bug causes a segmentation
violation.

On our system this program resides in /usr/bin/r and is called using
the syntax:
	r <program>
where <program> is an RT .sav file.  The directory /lib/rt is the default
device and contains:
	basic           (basic.sav)
	fortra          (fortra.sav)
	libr            (libr.sav)
	link            (link.sav)
	macro           (macro.sav)
	syslib.obj
	sysmac.sml
