.sh DESCRIPTION
Setwin allows trap instructions to be treated just like other exceptions rather
than as system calls.  If a trap instruction is encountered at a pc>=lo and pc<=hi
and if prior arrangements have been made to catch the signal then the sigsys signal
is sent to the process rather than interpreting it as a system call.
