rtpip -[xrldis[av]] dev [file ...]
	Access an RT filesystem.
	-x      extract named files from RT device, dev.  File
		args may use standard shell glob syntax (escaped
		so that the shell doesn't interpret it).  If no
		file args given, all files are extracted.
	-xa     same as -x except files are assumed to be ASCII
		so all nulls and carriage returns are deleted.
	-r      replace the named files on the RT device, dev.
	-ra     same as -r except files are assumed to be ASCII
		so carriage returns are inserted before newlines.
	-l      list directory
	-la     list directory and empty slots
	-lv     list directory with verbose information: file length
		and starting block, creation date, and directory
		segment containing filename entry.
	-d      delete named files
	-i      init RT filesystem: 1-st file arg is filesystem size in
		blocks (must be >=16); optional 2-nd file arg is number
		of directory segments to make (must be <= 31; if blank
		filesystem size/150 is used).
	-s      squeeze RT files to consolidate free space
