	This is the directory which contains the files which loads the routines
which comprise m7 or QP which were written by T. Marriott and G. Skillman who
lived in the house that Jack built.

	To load M7, use the file "LDM7" by typing loadm7/LDM7 from the
directory m7. Similarly, to load the query processor, type loadm7/LDQP.

	The remaining files are used to get a copy of the source code for M7
or QP. Simply type 

	listm7qp |lpr
	listrestm7 |lpr

to get M7 or type

	listm7qp |lpr
	listrestqp |lpr

to get a listing of QP.

	If an error message occurs on the load command such as "Can't find
ld/bin", it is probably because there are too many files listed in the
unix command making the command too long.  If this is the case, you will
have to split the list of routines in half and print them in two batches.
