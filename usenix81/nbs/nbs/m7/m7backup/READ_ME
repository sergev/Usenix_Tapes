	This directory contains some of Tony Marriotts old routines to M7.
These routines may be deleted when the boss feels secure with the newer version
of M7 as G. Skillman left it.

	The one file which should not be deleted is "itried" which contains
a valiant attempt to eliminate the need to specify the # of macros in the 'f'
option file. It only works partially for some reason. The main problem is that
M7 has the "%MACRO" command so that the count of macros that would be stored
at the beginning of the file must be updated constantly. (Or a command such
as "%EXIT" could be added to M7 to terminate processing normally so that the
macro count in the file could be updated. )
	Perhaps an easier solution to this problem is to scan the macro file
for macros with the "<" feature so that the list of such macros can be re-
created.
