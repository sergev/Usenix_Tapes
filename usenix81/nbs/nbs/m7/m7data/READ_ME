'Syntaxtbl' is a macro file for QP with the syntax macros for rootsem, setsem,
treetsem and treensem.
'Smplquery' is the sample query given in the handout months ago before Tony
Marriott left for school.
'Root', 'set', 'treet', 'treen' and 'syntax' are non-nroffed versions of the

*** The following are M7 macro files: ***

'Dotofor' is the macro file found in section 10 of the User's Manual
which converts a FORTRAN do statement into a C 'for' statement.
'M7syntax' contains syntax macros only for M7.
Finally, 'CTOFOR' is a macro file for M7 which Tony Marriott wrote to convert
'C' source code into 'FORTRAN'. Other macro files such as this one
can be found in Tony Marriott's directories.


The files "manmacs" and "manproc" are files that contain the macros that
are in  the M7 Internals Manual.
