Hi Sandy, I finally got it all working!

	This directory contains the syntax and semantics output for the four
TDMS languages/semantics. Note that treetanswer doesn't make sense. This is
because no "family" was given on the query! The macros are working fine however.



			Well, back to the micro to try & get that version going!
