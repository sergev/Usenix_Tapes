This version of dungeon is in 4BSD demand load format (413).
It ought to be convertible to simple readonly text format (410)
by poking the magic number and removing the padding in the
first page.  It is supplied as is, in binary, because it is
much more fun if you don't peek at the source.

The advantage of this version of dungeon is that it is a VAX native
mode program and runs a bunch faster than the RT11 compatibility mode
versions which have to read overlays and do something very slowly after
just about every command (not sure what; maybe interpret some floating point).
This version, 2.5A, is also more up to date than the dungeon you get
with 4BSD.

The problem is that I had to hack the a.out file to get it into standard
4BSD demand load format.  I can't guarantee that it works.  If it does,
it should conform to the documentation you got with 4BSD.
The .dat files (which are different from the old ones) go in
/usr/games/lib.

I am mildly interested in hearing if it really does work on other
4BSD systems.  Send me a post card from nirvana.
