bin/df		a v7 shell file that inhales the mount table and prints a
		'df' for each mounted filesystem (including the pathname)

bin/help	a shell file similar to 'man' that finds a document and fires
		up nroff to print it...except that it uses 'tmac.help' to
		paginate in screensize chunks.

src/acct.c	prints out the accounting file.  can be used to see what's
		been happening in general or to look at a specific user.

src/cookie.c	randomlyy prints a fortune cookie type message from the file
		usr/lib/cookie

src/cpm		program that allows a UNIX system to read and write CP/M
		format floppy disks.  currently requires an RX11 driver that
		handles CP/M interleaving, but should not be hard to change.

src/getterm.c
src/tprintf.c	a terminal independent printf that does some optimization.

src/logger.c	coughs up a message whenever someone logs on or off

src/sim		discrete event simulation package.  see doc/sim.3

src/splot.c	simple screen plotting program

src/talk.c	like write(1), but character at a time.  also does hand-
		shaking before allowing conversation to begin.

src/words.c	attempts to find words that sound like those entered.

src/xtime.c	tests current time for shell files.  allows very flexible
		date specifications.

sys/dev/rx.c	RX01 floppy driver.  table driven interleaving.  handles
		IBM standard, a local format, CP/M, and RT11 interleaves.

sys/sys/clock.c.diff	small mod to clock.c that gives a blinky-light
		histogram of cpu time usage for 11/45 or 11/70.

usr/lib/tmac/tmac.help	macro package for 'bin/help' - page size is screenful
		and excess space is stripped somewhat.

usr/lib/tmac/tmac.rose	yes, another macro package for nroff.
