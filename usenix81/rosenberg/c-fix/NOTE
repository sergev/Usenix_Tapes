	More on Compiler Bugs
		10 Feb 81

In "READ-ME", dated 1 Feb 81, I discussed
a fix to the bug illustrated in "bug.c".

We just received a copy of the 4th Berkeley Software
Distribution.  In the file "/usr/news/v7bugs",
there were different (independent) bugs
to the optimizer discussed.  The file included
a fix to one of those bugs from Dennis Ritchie.
