I contributed some shell extensions
to the software distribution from the
Delaware Usenix association meeting.

	delaware/pittsburgh/sh
	or
	delaware/pittsburgh/rosenberg/sh

It included command files "MAKSRC", "SAVE", and "RESTORE",
similar, but not identical to those here.
The second line of each reassigned variable "SYS"
to directories specific on our system.
I inadvertantly forgot to change them.
If this gave you difficulty, deleting that line
should uncover the intended assignment on the first line.

Summary of steps to generate new shell:

	1.	cd to that directory
	2.	MAKSRC
	3.	make 2>err
