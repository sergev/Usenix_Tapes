Compat has the PDP-11 compatiblity mode for VAX 11/780 from Pittsburg
modified to support MACRO on Version 6 Unix, which is in macro.  Something
to access PDP-11 Version 7 dump tapes from Virtual (1K blocks) unix is
in v7restor.  This stuff was thrown together in a hurry and no claims
about completeness or consistency are made (sorry).
