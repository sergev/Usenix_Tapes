NAME
	macro - macro assembler for UNIX

SYNOPSIS
	macro [option1 option2 ...] file1 file2 ... filen

DESCRIPTION
	Macro assembles the concatenation of the specified files
	terminating when a ".end" statement is encountered.  The
	resulting object file is usually named  filen.obj. ( see
	below)  If a file arg. does not contain a ".",  file.m11
	will be sought before file itself.


	Options, if desired, may appear anywhere in the command,
	and are chosen from the following:

		1) -ls  Produce an assembly listing named filen.lst
		2) -cr  Produce a cross-reference listing named
			filen.lst.  If the -ls option is also included,
			the cross-reference listing will follow the
			assembly listing in filen.lst.
		3) -lp  Same as -ls, but spools filen.lst for printing
			upon completion.
		4) -no  No object file is produced.  This is useful for
			syntax checking or producing the listing only.
		5) -xs:n  Allocates nK words of extra space for
			symbol table and macro storage.
		6) -ns	no symbol output in object modules.
			(thus ddt know of no symbols from this assembly)
		7) -na:file over ride above convention of using last name
			as file name; rather file.<ext> is output.
		8) -gl  make all undefined symbols global.
			suppress the "missing end statement error"

FILES

	/bin/print - spooler (can be link to /bin/lpr)
	/usr/local/macxrf - cross-reference post-processor
