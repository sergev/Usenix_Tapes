FORMAT: .psect name at1, at2, ...

Where name is the name to be assigned the psect and the "at's" are
the attributes of the psect.  the attributes are chosen from these:

	1. CON - concatenated - successive instances of this named psect
	   will be linked head-to-tail.
	2. OVR - overlay - successive instances of this named psect will
	   overlay each other, such that the length of the psect will
	   be dictated by the longest single instance.
	3. LCL - local - the scope of this named psect is limited to this
	   assembly.
	4. GBL - global - the scope of this psect is global to all object
	   modules being linked.
	5. REL - relocated - the contents of this named psect are to be
	   relocated at link time.
	6. ABS - absolute - the contents are absolute.
	7. SHR - shared - the contents of this psect are to be shared &
	   read-only.
	8. PRV - the contents are to be private & read/write.
	9. BSS - this psect actually has no contents, but the addresses
	   within it will be initially zeroed when the program is executed.
	   BSS should be used for all data which need not have specific
	   contents initially, as it will not have to be read in from disk.
	   Any data generated within a BSS psect will merely reserve space,
	   hence, the only useful directives are .BLKW & .BLKB
  if this is a macro-linkr for a i&d system,
	10) ins	this is to go in instruction memory
	11) dat this is to go in data memory


The default attributes are: OVR, GBL, REL, PRV
The attributes need be given only for the first mention of a particular
named psect within an assembly.  The first 8 attributes above are
actually complementary pairs, while BSS carries the implications of PRV.

note that abs psects are always linked at 0 of data memory,
and have no length. therefore, they will be clobbered by
other csects or symbols.
