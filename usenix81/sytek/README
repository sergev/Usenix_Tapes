Included you'll find a line printer spooling system and
a replacement for the Version 7 cu(1) command.  Both
systems are currently being used on Version 7 PDP-11 
and VM/UNIX systems.  The spooling system should be useable
under Version 6 (no promises), but the tip program is
probably too tightly coupled to the V7 ioctl capabilities
to be easily retrofitted.

All available manual pages (possibly out of date) are in the
man directory.
