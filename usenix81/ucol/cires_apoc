The following routines are locally produced programs
available for public use.
They are not documented in either the standard or USGS
versions of the UNIX manual,
but local documentation is available in the standard manual page format.
The source files for the manual pages are in /usr/man;
alternatively, Ernie has a set of originals available for Xeroxing.
