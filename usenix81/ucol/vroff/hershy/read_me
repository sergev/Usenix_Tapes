These are files describing a series of vector fonts distributed by the
US Navy. "cfd" is actually a directory file with points into the other
two files (used for efficiency). "charlib" contains character descriptions
widths and heights. "fontlib" contains the actual vector representations
in the most ungodly format you can imagine. These files are used by
programs in the source directory.
