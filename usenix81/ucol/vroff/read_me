This is the UCSF version of the Toronto Versatec troff simulation.
Points to note:

1)  Troff is unmodified, except that the default width tables were changed,
and that we decided to put ", #, <, >, @, \, ^, {, }, and ~ into
all the fonts, rather than just the special fonts.
Also, /(mo (member of symbol) has been replace by /(ag, angstrom.
The changed troff source file is supplied in this directory as "tab3.c".

2)  The fonts have been generated from the U.S. Navy "Hershey fonts".
We have no idea what the legal status of the Hershey fonts are, we got
them years ago and nobody remembers.  We think the are public domain.
Many characters have since been hand edited to improve their appearance.
(Editing programs supplied.)

3)  Documentation and commenting of some programs is sketchy.
Toronto did not supply any documentation on the format of the vector
character tables (hershy/*) and they look complicated.

4)  Either "rfont.a" (rotated characters) or "font.a" (unrotated characters)
archive file should be dearchived and installed as "/usr/lib/vfont".

5)  The UCSF modifications to vcat to permit 90 degree rotation of the
output (see edfont/fontrot.*) make it absolutely necessary to use a filter
(either trot or tsort) between troff and vcat.

The following files are supplied:

fonts.a		contains the original versatec bit map fonts
rfonts.a	contains the rotated versatec bit map fonts
tab3.c		new module for troff
trot.c		compiles into trot or tsort, filters troff output
vcat.c		the actual versatec simulator
mfont.*,makec.c	make character fonts from the vector table
		(you probably won't need to use this)
*width*		make character width tables for troff
		(you probably won't need this either)
doc/*		contains pages for the manual
hershy/*	the vector character tables
proto/*		more stuff about making bit map fonts
edfont/*	programs to let you work on the bit map fonts
