These drivers may be of some use; we do not
claim to have included everything you may
need to build them right into your system. But
you should be able to get going in a hurry.
If you have questions or enhancements, see the
addresses in the topmost README file.

For the Dicomed, we have other tools for vector
and raster images, etc. They are not included
because so many graphics places like to roll their
own. They are, however, free to a good home.
