Hello, this file contains brief descriptions of all the contents of
this directory: /csl/bin/stat.

TAPE FORMAT:
create:	tar cvfb /dev/rmt0 20 .
extract:tar xfb /dev/rmt0 20

DOCUMENTATION:
In stat/doc is all the on-line documenation for the programs.  Most are
in UNIX Programmer's Manual "man" format and can be installed in
/usr/man or run off with the command "nroff -man <file>.
Two files, named with upper case letters, are tutorials and are
run off with the -me macros.

COMPILING AND TESTING:
In stat/src is a Makefile for all the programs.  At the beginning of
this makefile is the name of a directory "BIN" that you may want to
change before making all the programs.  BIN is where all the compiled
programs are eventually put.  You may also want to begin by removing
all the old files with the command
	rm *.o
To compile a program, say "desc," type "make desc" and desc will be
installed in BIN.  To test the programs, make dm, anova, and regress,
and try the commands:

	dm s1 s2 s3 s4 s5 < data | anova subject OS time dificulty errors
	dm s1 s2 s3 s4 s6 < data | anova subject OS time dificulty rt
	dm s6 s5 < data | regress rt errors
	dm s6 s5 < data | pair ps rt errors
	dm s6 < data | desc so hi30m100 cfp

These are all in test/TRY_ME.
