			UNIXSTAT NOTICE			10 August 1982

Due to an ever increasing strain on my personal resources,
I have instituted the following plan for distributing tapes
of my statistical software running under UNIX (V6, V7 or BSD
2.8, 4.0, and 4.1):
	Basic distribution fee: $20.00, which covers:
		1.  A small mag tape written in whatever format desired
		    (by default: tar cfb /dev/rmt0 20)
		2.  Postage within the continental US or similarly
		    priced region (e.g. Canada, I think)
		3.  Handling: tape mounting, packing,
		    and delivery to post office
	Reduced distribution fee: $10.00, which covers:
		1.  Handling: tape mounting and delivery to post office
		    (you supply tape, and prepaid return mailer)

Unfortunately, the full software, with supporting documentation
and examples will not fit on a floppy disk.

Any variations might result in delayed or modified distribution.
For example, if you send a large tape without a mailer, you may
get a small tape returned because of the smaller mailing fees.

These distribution guidelines are subject to change without notice.
