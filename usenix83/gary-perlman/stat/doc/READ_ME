This is the documentation directory for UNIXSTAT.
It has two directories:
	man	contains manual entries in nroff source form
	cat	contains these entries already formatted
Paper copies of the documentation should be run off using
whatever nroff/troff flags are appropriate for your hard
copy device to take full advantage of its capabilities.
On a diablo, the nroff command might be:
	nroff -T450 -e -h -man file | diablo
Fast runoffs can be accomplished using the Makefile in the
man directory.
