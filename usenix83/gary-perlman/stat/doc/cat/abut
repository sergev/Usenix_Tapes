     _A_b_u_t makes a list of files with N lines into one file with N
     lines by printing all the first lines of those files on one
     line, then the second lines, and so on, until all the lines
     from the shortest file have been printed (but see the -_c
     option).  _A_b_u_t reads from its file arguments in the order
     they appear in the call to _a_b_u_t and prints to the standard
     output.  Any white space at the end of lines is removed, but
     at least one space between fields from different files is
     guaranteed.  Optionally, the field width of the columns can
     be specified by including an integer argument specifying the
     field width.  If this argument is negative, fields will be
     left justified the absolute value of the field width.  The
     default printing format is to put a tab between correspond-
     ing lines of separate files.

     Flag options must be preceded by a dash (-) to indicate they
     are not file names.  They can be supplied in any order.

          have been exhausted once.  Files with fewer lines than
          the longest will be rewound and printed again.
