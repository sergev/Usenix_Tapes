     _P_a_i_r is useful for analyzing paired data by providing sum-
     mary statisics and scattergrams.  It can also be used to
     analyze a time series or any ordered series of data.  _P_a_i_r
     reads pairs of points (two points per line) from the stan-
     dard input and without options provides statistics on the
     first variable (X), the second (Y), and their difference.
     If only one datum is on each line, then _p_a_i_r will supply the
     datum number (1 to N) as the first variable and use the
     datum as the second.  _B_i_p_l_o_t has the same capabilities as
     pair, but without options prints a bivariate plot.  If less
     than ten points plot to a coordinate, the number of points
     is plotted, otherwise a star is plotted.  _P_a_i_r'_s options are
     described below.  If an option letter is followed by some-
     thing in angled <brackets>, a number or string is expected
     to immediately follow it.

          sets the name of the first variable to <NAME> (default
          is "Column 1")

     yyyy<<<<NNNNAAAAMMMMEEEE>>>>

     For plots, the number of points is limited to some large
     number, perhaps 1000.
