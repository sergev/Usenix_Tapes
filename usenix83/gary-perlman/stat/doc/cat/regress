     _c_o_r_r/_r_e_g_r_e_s_s performs a general linear correlation analysis
     with an optional multiple linear regression analysis.
     _c_o_r_r/_r_e_g_r_e_s_s reads from the standard input (via redirection
     with < or piped with |) and writes to the standard output.
     The program is based on the methods described by Kerlinger
     and Pedhazur (1973) in _M_u_l_t_i_p_l_e _R_e_g_r_e_s_s_i_o_n _i_n _B_e_h_a_v_i_o_r_a_l
     _R_e_s_e_a_r_c_h.

     _c_o_r_r/_r_e_g_r_e_s_s prints means, standard deviations, and correla-
     tions for up to ten variables.  It has two names, corr and
     regress, and depending on which you use, you will get dif-
     ferent amounts of information.  If the program is called
     "corr", then only the correlation analysis is done.  If the
     program is called "regress", then regression equation coef-
     ficients (slopes and intercepts), the squared multiple
     correlation coefficients and significance tests are computed
     for every possible dependent variable.  _T_h_e _r_e_g_r_e_s_s_i_o_n _c_o_e_f_-

     _v_a_r_i_a_b_l_e.

     The program assumes that its input is a file of lines, each
     containing an equal number of numerical fields.  Optionally,
     names for these fields can be supplied in your call to the
     program, but if none are specified, A, B, C, etc. are used.

     _r_e_g_r_e_s_s will complain about "ragged input" if there are not
     an equal number of fields on each line.  If some fields are
     not numerical, _r_e_g_r_e_s_s will complain about "non-numerical
     input." If _r_e_g_r_e_s_s tries to do a regression analysis, and
     finds that two variables are perfectly correlated, _r_e_g_r_e_s_s
     will complain about a "non-singular correlation matrix."
