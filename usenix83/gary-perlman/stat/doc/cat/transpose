     _T_r_a_n_s_p_o_s_e reads its input from the standard input and tran-
     sposes lines and columns.  Optionally, the width of the
     field holding each string can be specified, however, at
     least one space is guaranteed between fields.  If the width
     is negative, then the absolute value of the width is used to
     left justify fields.  Without formatting instructions, _t_r_a_n_-
     _s_p_o_s_e puts a tab between fields on a line.

     The input must be regular: an equal number of columns per
     line.  AT most 100 lines or columns are allowed, but this
     can be changed with a new #define and recompiling.  Other
     diagnostics are self explanatory.
