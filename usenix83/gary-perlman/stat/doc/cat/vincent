     _V_i_n_c_e_n_t is useful for looking at trends over time/trials in
     data.  _V_i_n_c_e_n_t takes as arguments a series of files of
     numbers.  For each file, _v_i_n_c_e_n_t divides the series of
     numbers into _n equal parts using linear interpolation and
     prints the means for each part (called a vincentile).  For
     example,
                          vincent 5 foo bar
     will print the means for each fifth of the files "foo" and
     "bar." For each file argument, _v_i_n_c_e_n_t prints the number of
     points read in from that file, the name of the file, and the
     means for each of the ``vincentiles'' you have asked for.

     _V_i_n_c_e_n_t is useful for comparing series of different lengths.
     This was its original use in mathematical psychology some
     decades ago.  See the Handbook of Mathematical Psychology,
     by, among others, Pat Suppes for a thrilling discussion.

     The program is named after S. B. Vincent who suggested a 4-
     tile version of the procedure.  You can look up the original
     source in his 1912 paper, The function of the vibrassae in
     the behavior of the white rat.  _B_e_h_a_v_i_o_r _M_o_n_o_g_r_a_p_h_s.
