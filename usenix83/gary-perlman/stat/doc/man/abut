.SH NAME
abut \- formatted printing of corresponding lines from files
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B abut
[width] [-nc] file1 file2 ...
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Abut
makes a list of files with N lines into one file
with N lines by printing all the first lines of those files
on one line, then the second lines, and so on,
until all the lines from the shortest file have been printed
(but see the
.I -c
option).
.I Abut
reads from its file arguments in the order they appear in the call to
.I abut
and prints to the standard output.
Any white space at the end of lines is removed,
but at least one space between fields from different files
is guaranteed.
Optionally, the field width of the columns can be specified
by including an integer argument specifying the field width.
If this argument is negative, fields will be left justified the
absolute value of the field width.
The default printing format is to put a tab between
corresponding lines of separate files.
.PP
Flag options must be preceded by a dash (-)
to indicate they are not file names.
They can be supplied in any order.
.TP
.B n
All output lines are
.I numbered
beginning with 1.
.TP
.B c
.I Cycle
through lines of short files until longest is exhausted.
.I Abut
will continue printing until all files have been exhausted once.
Files with fewer lines than the longest will be rewound and printed again.
