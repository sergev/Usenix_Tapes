.SH NAME
pair, biplot - statistics: paired points analysis
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B pair
[options]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Pair
is useful for analyzing paired data by providing
summary statisics and scattergrams.
.I Pair
reads pairs of points (two points per line)
from the standard input and without options
provides statistics on the first variable (X), the second (Y),
and their difference.
.I Biplot
has the same capabilities as pair, but without options
prints a bivariate plot.
If less than ten points plot to a coordinate, the number
of points is plotted, otherwise a star is plotted.
.I Pair's
options are described below.
If an option letter is followed by something in angled <brackets>,
a number or string is expected to immediately follow it.
.TP
.B b
asks for a bivariate plot (same as p)
.TP
.B c<CHAR>
sets the character plotted to <CHAR>
.TP
.B h<N>
sets the height of the plot to <N> lines
.TP
.B p
asks for a bivariate plot (same as b)
.TP
.B s
asks for summary statistics
.TP
.B w<N>
sets the width of the plot to <N> characters
.TP
.B x<NAME>
sets the name of the first variable to <NAME> (default is "Column\ 1")
.TP
.B y<NAME>
sets the name of the second variable to <NAME> (default is "Column\ 2")
.SH LIMITATIONS
For plots, the number of points is limited to some large number,
perhaps 1000.
