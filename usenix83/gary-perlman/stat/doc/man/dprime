.SH NAME
dprime \- compute d' and beta for signal detection data
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B dprime
[file] [hit-rate false-alarm-rate]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I dprime
can be given two arguments: the hit-rate and the false-alarm-rate,
for which it will print d' and beta.
Alternatively,
.I dprime
reads raw data from a named file, or from the standard input.
If raw data are input,
.I dprime
assumes a two column input in which the first column tells whether
signal+noise or just noise were presented,
and the second column tells how the observer responded.
The following strings can be used to indicate signal+noise:
.ti 1i
signal, yes, 1, 1.0000
.br
while the following can be used to indicate noise:
.ti 1i
noise, no, 0, 0.0000
