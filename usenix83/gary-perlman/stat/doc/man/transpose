.TH TRANSPOSE 1STAT "May 30, 1982"
.SH NAME
transpose \- transpose matrix type file of strings
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B transpose
[width] [file]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Transpose
reads its input from the standard input and
transposes lines and columns.
Optionally, the width of the field holding each string
can be specified, however,
at least one space is guaranteed between fields.
If the width is negative, then the absolute value of
the width is used to left justify fields.
Without formatting instructions,
.I transpose
puts a tab between fields on a line.
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
The input must be regular: an equal number of columns per line.
AT most 100 lines or columns are allowed,
but this can be changed with a new #define and recompiling.
Other diagnostics are self explanatory.
.SH SEE\ ALSO

.SH AUTHOR
Gary Perlman (based on a program of Jay McClelland's)
.SH BUGS
Fields longer than 20 charcaters are truncated without comment.
