.SH NAME
vincent \- vincentizing of data from files
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B vincent
n file1 file2 ...
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Vincent
is useful for looking at trends over time/trials in data.
.I Vincent
takes as arguments a series of files of numbers.
For each file,
.I vincent
divides the series of numbers into \fIn\fR equal parts
using linear interpolation and prints the means for each part
(called a vincentile).
For example,
.ce
vincent 5 foo bar
will print the means for each fifth of the files "foo" and "bar."
For each file argument,
.I vincent
prints the number of points read in from that file,
the name of the file, and the means for each of the ``vincentiles''
you have asked for.
.PP
.I Vincent
is useful for comparing series of different lengths.
This was its original use in mathematical psychology
some decades ago.  See the Handbook of Mathematical Psychology,
by, among others, Pat Suppes for a thrilling discussion.
