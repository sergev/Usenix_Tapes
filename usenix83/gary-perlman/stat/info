UNIXSTAT is a package of data analysis programs
running on the UNIX operating system
developed at The University of California's San Diego campus.
The programs are known to run on machines as small as
DEC PDP 11/23's and on UNIX operating systems as early as Version 6.
As of the date of this message,
the following programs are distributed for a nominal
postage and handling fee.

dm	column oriented data manipulator
io	control and monitor input and output
maketrix	create matrix type file from free-form file
transpose	transpose matrix type file

anova	multi-factor anova with repeated measures
calc	algebraic calculator
critf	critical F-ratio given probability and degrees of freedom
desc	descriptive statistics, histograms, frequency tables

Distribution tapes include the source files for the programs,
\fBnroff\fR source files for the manual entries for the programs,
and a directory of test examples.
The tapes are made with the command:
.ce
tar cfb /dev/rmt0 20 stat
which can be read with the command:
.ce
tar xfb /dev/rmt0 20
which will create a directory called "stat" in the current working directory.
The "stat" will have sub-directories:
.AL
.LI
src is where source files are kept.
The programs are compiled and installed with \fBmake\fR.
You may have to modify the Makefile in the src directory.
.LI
doc is where manual entries and tutorials are kept.
There is a Makefile for running off the manual entries.
.LI
test is where test examples are kept.
You can try out some of the programs after they have been installed
by running the shell program called TRY_ME.
You can compare the output with TRY_ME.out.
