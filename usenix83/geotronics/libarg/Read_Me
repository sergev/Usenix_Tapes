This is the source directory for /usr/lib/libarg.a, which is the library
for the argument processing package described in argument(3l),
the source for which is backed up here as argument.3l.
The help file, /usr/hlp/argument.doc, has source argument.nr here.

The corresponding include file is <argument.h>,
and argument.h.bak is a backup for it.

Approximate sizes:
text    data    total
5200     600    5800    argument processing code proper
 200      10     210    error handling code (errhead)
5400     610    6010    all

Size notes:

The amount of argument processing code used can be decreased by
not using arg_show, arg_synopsis, arg_help, etc.
About half the processing overhead can be saved.

The amount of data used is actually greater by some 24 bytes
per specified ARGUMENT, as a structure is allocated for each.

Printf, scanf, and stdio are always used.

The *cmderr routines are not used directly by the argument package.
There are two versions:
	cmderr.%r       Uses the V6 printf %r format.
	cmderr.varargs  Uses the V7 varargs macros and the System III printf.
