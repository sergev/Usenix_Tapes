	This is a mini-distribution put together at the LSU/Lions Eye
Research Computer Facility for the USENIX community.  Except for the
graphics and occasional terminal controls that might have slipped
through, the code should be fairly portable.  Some of the system
calls (II) may give you trouble, but the compiler will generally
report missing or unusual calls and macro defs.
	We are running a V6/PWB/V7 amalgam at the moment, so be
patient....

	Contents include:

		./RIPS     - Reference Information Program for Scientists
		./bastrans - almost debugged BASIC -> C translator
		./bin.src  - some code changes to ed (I), sort(I), etc.
			     to handle larger files, implement more pro-
			     tections, etc. for RIPS database security.
			     Also, some routines lifted from earlier
			     dists, with source citation where available.
		./grph2d   - some primative graphics routines which some
			     of the stats programs expect for plotting
			     polynomial fits, etc. on a (sorry) Printronix
			     P300 line printer/plotter.
		./misc.src - just that: our jiffy news program, another
			     oracle, mailing list stuff, alarm clock,
			     order forms.
		./stats    - nothing too esoteric, but one life scientist's
 			     collection of routine statistical programs made
 			     user friendly for friendly users.

	If any files needed to put up the stats package or rips are
found to be missing, please let me know!
