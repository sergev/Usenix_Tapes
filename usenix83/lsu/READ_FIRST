Dear USENIX ASSOC.:

	On this tape is a distribution for your next tape.  Note
it was created under educational source licenses for PWB and V7.
Look at it to decide if any restrictions need be imposed.  None
of it is system stuff, but for those who are still running older
versions of ED(I) and SORT(I) slightly modified versions appear
in bin.src.  Other stuff in bin.src is also non-lsu generated.
Include this under ./lsu_eye/* after removing this note.
