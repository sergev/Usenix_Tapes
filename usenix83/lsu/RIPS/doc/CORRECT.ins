     Currently the standard UNIX editor is in use.  Exit if you are not
familiar with ED(I) and learn its use.

     When you make corrections, note that the rips files have a specific
structure: #auths|auth1|...|authn|year|title|journal|volume|pp|#keywords|
keyword1|...|keywordn| .  If you alter this structure, you will be disappointed
with some of the functions of rips!
