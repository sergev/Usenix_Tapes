This program was written at LSU (Dr Klyce) to help staff manage their
reprint files.  The more useful attributes include:
.sp1
.in6
.ll-6
1.  Storage of reprint references in individual (personal) files 
which can be searched for the preparation of formatted bibliographies or
for pulling articles on file.
.sp1
2.  Complete file management with editing and automatic
regeneration of sorted keyword list including elimination of "unkeywords"
such as prepositions, adverbs, etc.
.sp1
3.  Automatic file card printing for hard copy index file.  Latest entries
stored in parent file plus in parent.new so the index file can be easily
updated.
.sp1
4.  Production of reprint request post cards and mailing labels.
.sp1
5.  Menu driven, practically self-instructional interactive programming.

To get started you should have a user account on the LSU/Lions Eye Research Computer
and have studied the document "UNIX for Beginners."  Following this, gather
your reprints or file cards and enter the program by logging in and typing
"rips" followed by <return>.  This should get you into the system.
When asked for file name enter one of the databases listed (NOT ones
with suffixes .new or .kwl), or create a new one by entering the initials
of the Principle Investigator, or get instructions (this file) by entering
help.
.sp1
.in6
.ll-12
Note that you will have access to all the files in the system
and can search these.  However, you will be denied permission to
enter the editor if (1) you do not own the current file or (2)
you are the owner, but it is currently being processed in the
background.

After a file has been entered, a menu will be printed which lists available
routines:
.in6
.ll-6
.sp1
e - enter the edit mode.  Currently the standard UNIX ED(I) is used.  Refer
to the ed tutorial manual if you are not familiar with ed.  Options in the
rips editor are:
.in12
.ll-6
.sp1
a - append or add references to the file. 
When prompted for reference type, four options are available: 'j' for
regular journal articles, 'c' for a book chapter, 'b' for book, and 'q'
for quit.
For the sake of
uniformity follow this format: for authors Lastname II (Jones DQ); for
year enter year without any punctuation (1899 or 1967 for example); for
title enter complete title, but DO NOT add a period at its end (rips will
do this for you); for journal use approved abbreviation (J. Irreproduc. Results);
for volume, enter the number without punctuation (eg., 213); for pages enter
complete pagination (eg, 111-123); and for keywords use one keyword per entry.
If you wish to document a book (b) or chapter (c), the prompts differ from
those of regular journal articles, but should be self-explanatory.
.sp1
c - correct entries in file or keyword list.
.sp1
s - strategic search of file for structural errors.
While the length of a reference is virtually unlimited, its
structure (explained below) is invariant for proper operation.  Running
this option checks for this type of error and reports references out
of specification which should then be corrected with the c option.

r - return to RIPS
.sp1
q - exit to the shell

The editor is useful also to peruse the file.  Note that when listing
it out with the editor on the terminal, the raw, unformatted form will be
seen.  For debugging purposes, this condensed format is: | #auths| auth1|
 auth2| ...| authn| year| title| journal (or book chapter)| volume # (or rest
of book info| #keywords| keyword1| keyword2| ...| keywordn|.  Disagreements
between #auths and actual number 
of authors is fatal.


r - retrieval of articles in file.  Instructions for use of this module
can be obtained on entry to it (try it and see).  The retrieval is set up
interpret a command line composed of (nearly) any number of keywords and
intercalated conjunctions with (nearly) any level of nested
parenthetical expressions.  AND and OR are true Boolean logical equivalents.
The NOT conjunction modifier is useful for exclusive or limited searches.
The prepositions BEFORE, AFTER and IN are also recognized for restricting
searches to certain time periods.
The search algorithm looks at
the entire reference entry including the keywords you originally associated with the
article.  NOTE:  As you create the file, do not enter keywords that
are in the title since this is redundant and wastes disk space.
Successful searches can be listed on the terminal, but are always stored in your
home directory as /usr/{your_name}/refs?????, where ????? is a fairly
unique number (the process ID number of your current rips job).
To relist
this file on the terminal, type "cat refs*"; to print on the line printer
type "cat refs* | {d}lpr -f".
Note: if you have more than one refs????? file, cat refs* will list them
all.  To list the last one, type "lss" and cat the refs????? file with
the numerically greatest suffix, e.g. cat refs01234 or cat *01234.
.sp1
g - this command will regenerate your entire keyword list (stored in
{file_name}.kwl).  Note that a kwl is created only on command.
You are warned when printing a keyword list if it is not current.
.sp1
d - this will allow you to change over to a new file.
.sp1
p - general purpose print function.
.sp1
.in12
.ll-6
t - print reference list on terminal.
.sp1
p - print reference list on line printer.
.sp1
k - print keyword list on terminal.
.sp1
l - print keyword list on line printer.
.sp1
c - print cards.  Options: f - print
file cards from either the whole file list
or from only the new entries ({file_name}.new).
r - create reference reprint request cards and
corresponding labels.  This also adds entered references
to the current file.  More information is available
within rips.

w - this command produces a temporary exit to the UNIX shell (%).  The
first <cntrl> d you type while out there should bring you back to rips.
.sp1
q - permanent exit from rips to the shell.

This tutorial is terse for lack of time (as usual), since we're expected
to do science first and program later.  Now it's much later, so GOOD LUCK.
Please report any difficulties, problems by <mail>ing klyce.
