RIPS REFERENCE REQUEST INSTRUCTIONS
.sp
.pp
Reprint request cards can be generated by rips so that reference data
need only be entered once.  As a request is made, the reference is
automatically added to the current database (which you must own!)
and to the communal reprint request post card file.  The actual
printing of the post cards & associated labels is done in batches
on the line printer by your friendly system manager, who should
be reminded to run these off by <mail>ing <root> a memo.
.pp
To use the reprint request facility, the person for whom the request
is being made (yourself, your supervisor, etc) must have a UNIX
account, must be the originator (owner) of the database used, and
must be the logged in user, i.e., if you're doing requests for
someone else you must login as that person.
.pp
Currently, only one person at a time can use the reprint request facility;
you will be told if the facility is busy.
Remember to schedule your time so that you are able to enter the
addresses of the authors for the requested reprints.  Otherwise,
the next user will be asked to fill in this information and
he/she won't have a clue as to where to get this information!
.pp
Note that the post cards will be printed
in English (default)
or Spanish, German, French, Italian, or Dutch if the last line of an
address contains one the 20 or so rips-recognized countries.
.pp
Finally, the facility is most efficiently used when working from ISI's
Current Contents.  When invoked, the facility is used exactly as when
adding references to a database.  However, when you are finished with
a group (say one issue of C.C.), you will be prompted for the addresses
of all the first authors of the entered references.  If the request is
to be made to other than the first author, respond to first address
line with "c/o <other author>".  Only 5 lines, including author name
will fit on a label --> plan ahead !
.pp
Please <mail> any comments, problems to <root>.
