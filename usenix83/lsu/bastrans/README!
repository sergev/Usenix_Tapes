	This is an unfinished product, but is included here since it works,
sort of.  The documentation is in the source files.  Briefly bastrans
was started as a mental exercise to improve the author's facility
with C Programming, and to reduce the overhead involved in hand-translating
several user Apple Basic programs into something running rather than walking.

	Several nice routines fell out of this project which we now use
in most of our user friendly applications packages (e.g. strinp.c, numinp.c,
replace.c).

	To use, compile (src/run), and use mk {program} which expects
you to have in residence {program}.bas.  Because I haven't been able to
spend more time on the project, mk calls sed (horrors!) for pre- and
post-processing to clean things up (i.e. take care of most bugs left
in bastrans).
