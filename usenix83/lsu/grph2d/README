	This is a collection of 2-D plotting routines called by
the plot options of the stats programs.  The bad news is that
it assumes a Printronix P300 is wired to /dev/lp.  Can be modified
fairly easily for other raster devices...see plot in fastplt.c.
	Compile commands live in run.  You will have to move code
to appropriate directories and tell plotfd, plotlb, etc where filterm
lives.
	NOTE:  These are not general purpose routines.  For such
see boulder/ampex and the tig contributions on the '80 & '81
USENIX tapes.
	We've just installed the boulder/ampex package with only minor
call changes and are writing apps programs for a recently inherited
Houston Complot, so the above novice attempts will soon be unsupported.
