	The program pharm.bas is a collection of stats programs written
in microcomputer BASIC (Apple & Trash 80 compat.) lifted from "Manual
of Pharmacological Calculations with Computer Programs" by Tallarida
& Murray, Springer-Verlag, New York, 1981, ISBN 0-387-90500-6.  It's
accuracy is unknown.  Our intent was to run it under UNIX BASIC, but
our BASIC is too small.  When time permits, I'll run it through
BASTRANS (a local BASIC to C translator).  Interested parties should
bug me about it in the future.  If you use these routines, purchase
of the above book is mandatory both for instructions and for copyright
protection!
