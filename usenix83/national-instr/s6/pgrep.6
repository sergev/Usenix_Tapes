.sh NAME
pgrep - extract cost data from specified paragraphs
.sh SYNOPSIS
pgrep [-#:[#]] [pfile] ...
.sh DESCRIPTION
.nf
-#      means multiply the recurring cost data obtained using the following
	pfile by # (default is 1.0)
-#:#    means multiply the recurring cost data by the first number and the
	non-recurring cost data by the second number

if no pfile is specified then STDIN is used.

The format of a pfile is:
     comment lines which do not contain any ':' characters, and
     paragraph selection lines of the form:
	     filename: paragraph ...

     where   filename is the name of a costdata breakdown file and
	     paragraph is the number of a paragraph whose data is to be
	     included in the output.  Arbitrary comments which follow the
	     paragraph number are ignored.

The output of pgrep is a sequence of costdata lines extracted from the
specified paragraphs of the specified files and extended by the specified
multiplier.

A costdata breakdown file contains text lines, which are ignored, paragraph
lines, which begin with a digit, and data lines which are of the form:
	<abbr> : <qnt> ...
or,
	<abbr> :: <qnt> ...
   where <qnt> is any legal arithmetic expression involving ( ) * / + - and
     numbers, and numbers may have $ prepended or % appended.
The first form is used for non-recurring costs and the second is used for
recurring costs.
Text lines must not start with a digit, nor contain any ':' characters.

A typical modus operandi is:
     1. ep the costdata breakdown file(s), e.g., ep cbfnnnn
     2. make the pfile(s) by
	a. grep "^ *[0123456789]" cbfnnnn... >pfxxxx
	b. ep the pfile to discard undesired paragraphs, e.g., ep pfxxxx
     3. optionally check that the resulting pfiles do not overlap, e.g.,
	comm -12 pfaaaa pfbbbb
     4. optionally check that the pfiles are complete, e.g.,
	grep "^ *[0123456789]" cbf* | sort >tmpcbf
	sort pf* >tmppf
	diff tmpcbf tmppf
     5. ep the nroff format headers for the cost summary sheets, e.g.,
	ep sumkkkk.n
     6. generate the cost summary sheets, e.g.,
	(cat sumkkkk.n; pgrep [-#] pfkkkk | spr ) | nroff | opr
