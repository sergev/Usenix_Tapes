spr [-e#] [-f[#]] [-g[#]] [-i<abbr>] [-o] [-p#.#.#]
.ti +8
[-r ratefile] [-t] [-x#:#]  [costdata]
.sh DESCRIPTION
.nf
 -e#     means calculate escalation factors based on # months
	 (default is 0, i.e., no escalation)
 -f      means suppress fee accounting
 -f1     means apply fee to each labor and cost category
 -f2     means apply fee to labor and direct cost separately
 -f3     means apply fee only to total
	 default is to apply fee wherever G&A is applied
	 (or to total if G&A suppressed)
 -g      means suppress G&A accounting
 -g1     means apply G&A to each labor and cost category
 -g2     means apply G&A to labor and direct cost separately
 -g3     means apply G&A only to total (default)
	 if f# specified and g# specified then both must agree
 -i<abbr> means suppress accounting of cost item or cost category
	 given by <abbr>; if <abbr> is : then all non-recurring
	 costs are suppressed; if <abbr> is :: then all recurring
	 costs are suppressed
 -o      means suppress overhead accounting
 -p#.#.# means set the precision (number of digits after the decimal)
	 for the hours, rate, and cost, to the respective numbers
	 (default is 1.2.2 which shows tenths of hours, cents of rate,
	 and cents of cost)
 -r      means use the next argument as the rate file
	 (default is /usr/lib/rates)
 -t      round off and sum rounded cost figures
	 (default is to keep trailing significance in rate and cost figures)
 -x#:#   means multiply all the recurring hour/quantity values by the first #
	 and all the nor-recurring values by the second #

 if no costdata file is specified then STDIN is used.

The format of a rate file is:
     comment lines which do not contain any ':' characters, and
     rate lines which consist of:
	     mnemonic:  rate:   category:  full_title

     where   rate is a floating point number
	     category is:
	 L1, L2, ...     for labor categories (rate is $/hr)
	 D1, D2, ...     for other direct cost categories (rate is $/whatever)
	 LE1, LE2, ...   for labor escalation factors (rate is %/yr)
	 DE1, DE2, ...   for other cost escalation factors (rate is %/yr)
	 LO1, LO2, ...   for labor overhead factors (rate is %)
	 G               for G&A factor (rate is %)
	 F               for fee factor (rate is %)

A costdata file contains text lines, which are ignored, and data lines which
are summed up.  Data lines are of the form:
     <abbr> : <qnt> ...
or,
     <abbr> :: <qnt> ...
and text lines must not contain ':'.  The first form is used for non-recurring
costs, and the second form is used for recurring costs.
<qnt> is any legal arithmetic expression involving ( ) * / + - and numbers,
where numbers may have $ prepended or % appended.
