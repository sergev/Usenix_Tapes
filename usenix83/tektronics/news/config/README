This is an experimental netnews configurator.  It's really a crazy
awk script that reads in options and generates commands to edit template
defs.h and Makefile.  System defaults are in the *.dflt files; user data
is in a similar form, and is supplied as a list of files on the 'config'
command.

Options may be given as:

	+option			Turn on option
	-option			Turn of option
	option=value		Turn on option and supply a value

In the default files, '@@' is used as the pattern for which a value is
substituted.  The string '-option=value' is legal, and can be used to
supply a default value for an option that is normally turned off.

The special option 'version' is used to indicate the underlying system;
it should by 'v7', 'usg', or 'ihcc'.  'Makefile', 'postnews', and 'install'
may be respecified individually in a similar fashion.

Case *is* significant in options, which is rather unfortunate.

A sample configuration file is given in MHB5B.
