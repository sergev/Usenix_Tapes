The following commands are part of netnews:

checknews - to see if there is new news
readnews  - to actually read the news
postnews  - simple interface to submit a news article
inews     - the real news submission command
newsinfo  - tells up-to-date information about USENET

Typical usage:
checknews -y  (this is in /etc/profile)

readnews  ( to read all news )
readnews -n newsgroup  (selectively select a newsgroup to read)
readnews -l    (list titles only)

You probably want to specify options in your $HOME/.newsrc file.
Several .newsrc files follow:

options -h -n all !net.all !fa.all  (subscribe to LOCAL and btl newsgroups).
		(The -h provides short headers)

options -n all !fa.all !net.rec.all !net.jokes.all

	USENET System Information
	-------------------------

Introduction.  USENET is an international network of UNIX sites,
with hookups into the ARPA network, too.  It is basically a fancy
electronic Bulletin Board system.  Numerous BTL machines are connected
at HO, IH, MH, with a few elsewhere, too.
In addition, there are major sites at universities:
	UC Berkeley, Duke, U Waterloo, and so on ...
and at industry nationwide:
	DEC, Tektronics, Microsoft, Intel, etc.

There are numerous bulletin board categories, set up in a hierarchy.
The first "node" in a category name indicates the breadth of distribution,
later nodes indicate content.  Read the newsgroup items for full lists.

Newsgroup naming conventions:

  NO prefix= LOCAL ONLY
  btl.    = Bell Labs
  net.    = USENET wide categories
  fa.     = from ARPA-Net (no return feed, except via mail)
  ____.all= everything in category "____".


The netnews newsgroups of most interest are:  

general		: local general information

btl.all 	: BTL Everything.

net.general	: general net-wide announcements 
net.bugs.v7	: reports of bugs and/or solutions to UNIX V7
net.news.b	: news about our version of netnews

echo fa.groups
cat >fa.groups <<E!O!F!
FA groups are "From the Arpanet" and are mostly copies of mailing lists
or "digests" distributed on that network. (A digest is a collection of mail
put together by an editor and sent out every so often. It is much like a
newsletter.)
A special convention applies to submissions to FA newsgroups.
You should not post directly to the newsgroup, since this will be
seen by people on USENET but not by the people on the arpanet who get the list
directly mailed to them. Instead, send mail to the name of the group on site
For example, to post an article to fa.human-nets, you might mail to
...!ucbvax!human-nets (where ... is the path from HERE to ucbvax).
FA groups and their corresponding mailing lists can reach a very large
user community, including USENET sites on UUCP, Berknet, BLN, and the
ARPANET, as well as sites on the ARPANET which are not on USENET,
who get the news via direct electronic mailing.

Some digests are turned off locally; others are fed into "net" groups;
still others are available in printed form only.  These conditions are
noted below.

Local newsgroups are those that do not begin with "net.", "btl.", or
"fa.".  They are not distributed to any other system.

echo net.groups
cat >net.groups <<E!O!F!
Net.all newsgroups are available to all people on the entire network
who read netnews. This does not mean they go to every machine, since some
machines restrict the volume of news that comes in. It is assumed that users
of such restricted machines can read news on another machine on which they
have a login. Newsgroups reach all of USENET (including USENET sites on the
ARPANET) but do not reach any sites that are not on USENET. That is, USENET
is defined as all sites that net.all reaches.
