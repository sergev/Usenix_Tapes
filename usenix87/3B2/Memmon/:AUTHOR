Here it is folks!  The UNIX memory displaying software.
If you want to look at all 2 megabytes of 3b2 SVR2
memory in one glance,  then these programs are for you.
Otherwise forget it.

Memmon uses curses to display an up to date view of
memory.  You can watch programs entering and leaving
memory as it happens.

Snap gives a more detailed account of who is using memory
and where.

		>>> NOTE <<<
Since both programs read /dev/kmem, they must run with
superuser status (cf ps(1) command).
After compiling, su to root then chown root and chmod u+s.

		enjoy!
