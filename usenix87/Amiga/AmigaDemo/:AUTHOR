The following is a graphics benchmark for the Commodore Amiga.
It performs several graphics and Intuition ( Amiga's user interface )
tasks. Some of the tests take some time, so be patient! There is a
nice punch at the end.

Here are the results: ( ran as 1> amigademo > raw:file )

 Doing point test in a full-screen window
Write pixel 640*200 took 31.5   Readpixel   640*200 took 23.1
Move        640*200 took 6.8    Control     640*200 took 0.9
Now doing point test directly to screen rastport
Write pixel 640*200 took 23.7   Readpixel   640*200 took 15.4
Move        640*200 took 6.8    Control     640*200 took 0.9
Block clear blitter 1:6.9 CPU 20.0
Block test in a full-screen window
Set 32K 10.2 Copy 14.7 Complement 14.7
Block test directly to screen rastport
Set 32K 10.1 Copy 14.4 Complement 14.3
Line test in window
Offset 0 result:10.5
Offset 1 result:10.6
Offset 20 result:10.5
Offset 100 result:10.4
