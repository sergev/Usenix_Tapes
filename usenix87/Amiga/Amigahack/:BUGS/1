The only problem I had was that my single-sided disk was too small to receive
the uuencoded binary, so I had to risk transferring the naked binary across
the campus network.  I used C-Kermit on a Vax (SET FILE TYPE BINARY) to
PC/Intercomm (Kermit-Image).  The binary traversed 4 X25 PADs in fine shape.

I'm running it on a 520, with 2 SS drives.  I have the binary on drive A:
and have the HACKDIR option set to B:.  All the other files (help, hh,
rumors, etc) are on drive B:.  I haven't made provision for save files as
there isn't really room :-)  I expect to run into space problems if I ever
reach the nether regions.

Congratulations to Andreas Bormann for doing an excellent job.

BTW:  It takes about 30 seconds to load up...
