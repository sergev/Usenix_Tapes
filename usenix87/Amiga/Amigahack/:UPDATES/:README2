Although this is not rightfully source, I am posting this and the next part
with net.sources because the remainder of the hack stuff was sources.

This part consists of the .info files and the utilities needed to put
them onto the Amiga.  To create a HACK system,:
  1) Format a diskette labeled 'HACK_GAME'
  2) Using the explode program, put all the files from this posting and
     part 13 (the hack executable) onto that disk
  3) CD to the HACK_GAME disk
  4) compile and link the atob program putting the executable program on
     the HACK_GAME disk
  5) Run the commands in the 'setup' file (i.e.  Execute setup).  This
     will unpack all the icon images and create the files needed to run hack.
  6) run atob converting Hack.z.b into Hack.z with
       atob <Hack.z.b >Hack.z
  7) Uncompress the executable image with the compress program
       compress -d Hack
At this point, you should have a running version of Hack.  Other than lost
characters, there shouldn't be much problems, but scream if something is
amis due to lost stuff.
