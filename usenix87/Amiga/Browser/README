Here we have a file browser for the Amiga. 50% based on the the PARC
browsers,and 50% based on a browser I wrote for Unix long ago (whose
name, I now realize, was probably inspired by the PARC browsers).

This is a "level 0" version. Useable, but it needs some things done
to. I've got more important things to do, so I'm turning it loose to
the net, in the hopes that someone else will improve it before I get
back to it.

Things that need to be fixed:

	1) Theres a loose pointer in there somewhere, but it only seem
	to mangle things if DEBUG is turned on. Not sure what's up.

	2) The UP and DOWN gadgets need to turn into a scroll bar gadget.

	3) The routine that pages the file needs to be re-written to
	use the console driver, and handle lines longer than the
	window is wide in a more intelligent manner.

	4) The initial (disks) menu needs to look to see what is
	really there, instead of just giving you the default three.
	Putting in the assigned'ed things at the same time might not
	be a bad idea.

Should you fix #1, or add any of #'s 2-4, please send me the source.
Likewise, any ideas you have or implement, let me know, and I'll see
about getting them into the first real version.
