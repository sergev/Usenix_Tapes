     Ahh, that wasn't so long was it. Here it is all you laser printer
fans, version 2.0 . For those of you that never saw the earlier version, 
good. This program will take your favorite IFF pictures and let you display
them on any POSTSCRIPT device, ie - a laser printer. 

     Many of the promised changes have been made :
1) The program now deals properly with HAM pictures. (Yea !!)
2) You can now select the output filespec, including SER: .
3) You can now scale your pictures to your taste.
4) I included the (messy) source code in this arc'ed release.

     Things I (sadly) did not get to :
1) Sorry, E and F are still the same color.
2) You can scale to your hearts content, but unless you want to
   modify the program code, you can't rotate.

----

     Now, how to use it :
claz [infile [outfile [x_start y_start x_scal y_scal] [H]]]

     Infile and outfile are pretty easy, and devices are valid for outfile.
So, if you actually have the laser printer connected directly to your
Amiga, you can use SER: as the output file (don't forget to set the
speed, etc with preferences). The brackets above indicate what is optional.
If you don't enter anything at all for parameters, you will be prompted
for infile, but the other values will go to their defaults. X_start and
y_start are the x and y coords of the lower left-hand corner of the picture.
I don't know about other printers, but on the Apple LaserWriter, they are
1/72 of an inch. X_scal and y_scal are the x and y output widths in the
same units as x and y_start. ie - if x_scal and y_scal are both 72, you
will get a 1 X 1 inch output picture. If you add the optional H, the
'showpage' command won't be added to the end of the file. This means,
the next picture you output after this one will go on the same page as
this one. Oh, I forgot to mention that the data is still appended to the
end of the output file, so if you use the same filespec twice, you will
end up with one file with both pictures in it.

----

     Ok, now for the problem solution section. I only got one complaint
about the last version. It guru'ed, no matter how it was used. Stupid me,
I forgot the one thing I have in my startup sequence that many people
don't. I increase the scack size. So, if you run into a guru all the
time, type 'stack 30000' and try again. 

     If you get the output file, but it won't print, try sending it with
a terminal program, so you can see what error message the printer is
sending back when it gets upset.

     Some misc hints : If you can, output the file to the ram disk. It will
go quite a bit faster this way. A 320X200 bitmap will take about 64k. Don't 
bother doing this with the input file, claz reads it all into memory
at the beginning of the program, then closes the file. The program allocates
200k for itself when it starts up, so take this into account when deciding
if you should use the ram disk.

    A rather IMPORTANT note: the program is not very neat about claning up 
when it runs into an error. If you have problems after an error, try 
rebooting. (I know it's an easy thing to fix, but I'm lazy.)

Tech Notes :

    Yes, I released the source code this time, no matter how embarrasing
it is. You may note that a lot of the math is strung out over several lines
and is very inefficient. This is left over from when I was using Aztec C
v 3.2 . For some reason it got really upset at lots of very straightforward
math and crashed when you ran it (sometimes it wouldn't even compile). I 
have 3.4 now, and all this is fixed, but redoing the math would be a pain,
so this is it for now.
    You may want to mess around with the postscript program that appears 
somewhere near the middle of the program. A few quick changes and you 
can have any rotation, etc ... your heart desires. 
    The IFF file is converted to a 4 bit gray scale, with F's changed to
E's because of the annoying look of absolute white when printing most
pictures. This is easy to change too if you desire, just set HEX[15]='F'.
