This is the source to MicroEmacs for the Amiga.  It is a fairly small Public
Domain Emacs that it beats ED hands down.  It supports multiple windows and 
one keyboard macro.  It is ifdefed to work on lots of different machines.
It is a straight port from IBMland.  I have someone working on using the
blitter to increase the speed of the display, and I have lots of ideas for
things that could be done to ehnance this emacs.  I am willing to play
"keeper-of-the-source" and co-ordinate efforts to enhance it.

So here it is, use it and enjoy.  Contact me if you want to help out
on improving it.

Cheers,
George M. Jones
