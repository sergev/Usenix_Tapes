    Haven't had any time to check this out, but if its up to the quality
of some of Bryce's other claims to fame (can you say Flash!, I knew
you could ;-)) it should be excellent!

Several	requests won this code for the rest of the net.	 This is the 68000
equivalent of the exec_support library (sorry no C interface).	
Also available if there is interest:

"why" for the CLI.  Ready for translation to other languages.  Gives much
more detailed info, faster, and	resident compatible. Example:

Fail code 20, and error	code 205; object not found

A text file (yet to be written)	that details how to eliminate the need to
link assembly programs with Amiga.lib.	Also a tiny version of Astartup.obj
for 68000 programmers (minimal WB and CLI startup junk)

>>INSTRUCTIVE FLAMES TO bryce@cogsci.berkeley.edu WELCOME!
