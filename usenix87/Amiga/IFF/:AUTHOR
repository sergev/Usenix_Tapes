    This is the first of two postings containing the Electronic Arts
    public domain examples for the IFF file interchange format.  This
    posting contains examples of reading and writing IFF files.
      The document describing the IFF formats will be included in the
    version 1.1 Rom Kernal Manual, which should be available soon.

      Briefly, an IFF file consists of one or more "chunks", each of
    which begins with a header consisting of a four-byte type identifier
    (such as "FORM", "ILBM", "PROP", etc.) followed by a long integer
    containing the size of the chunk. The data that make up the chunk
    follows as a string of bytes.  Each chunk is padded to end on an
    even word boundary (a la 68000).  Each chunk may contain other
    chunks.  The contents of each chunk is determined by its type, as
    specified in the identifier.
