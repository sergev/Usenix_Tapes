This is the same as was posted in full to comp.sys.  That was done because
it was so small and contained a elagant solution to a problem attacked
with severe brute force by the original poster.
The advantage is everyone gets to see it, the disadvantage is it 'disappears'
in the noise of the high volume very fast.

The uuencode was done with the checksuming program from FISH 53.  The
uudecode off the same disk does not work on all uuencoded files I have
run across, and thus my uuencodes are suspicious.
