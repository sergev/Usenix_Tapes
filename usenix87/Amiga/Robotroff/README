	Hello again.  A friend of mine suggested that I write this.  So I
did.  I'm rather proud of this one.  It's my most ambitious display hack
yet.  It's called "Robotroff".

	I'd tell you what this does, but much of the enjoyment of this
program is derived from its surprise value.  Therefore, I think you'll be
better served if you compile and/or run this program without first trying to
determine what it does.  If your curiosity level won't permit that, then
read the robotroff.doc file for instructions.

MANUFACTURE
	Here's how to make this monstrosity:
1> make

	There.  That wasn't so bad, was it?

USEAGE
	Just type "robotroff" at a CLI prompt.  Trust me.  If you're
absolutely convinced that nothing happened, try again, using "robotroff -i".

CAVEATS
	This program compiles under Manx 3.20a --==>> ONLY. <<==--  I'm
almost positive it won't compile/link under Manx 3.40 without modification
to the _main.c file.  (Aside:  You can safely eliminate the _main.c file,
but you lose one of the major features of the program by doing this.  Check
the source for more information.)  If there's enough demand, and if I ever
get my 3.40 upgrade, I'll create a version that will work with that.
Further, I suspect that this will never work under Lattice without a major
re-write.

	(Postscript:  Jim Goodnow II handed me a copy of 3.40 at the last
BADGE meeting, and I've had a chance to look at it.  It will take me a few
day to get up to speed on 3.40, but I will be posting a 3.40-compatible
version of _main.c.  Look for it in about a week or two (or three...).)

	Also, there apparently is a problem with invoking this program from
a Resident-CLI.  It may or may not crash the system if invoked this way.
Moral:  Invoke from a normal CLI and save your aspirin.

	I hope you like this one.  I do.  I hope my friend does.
