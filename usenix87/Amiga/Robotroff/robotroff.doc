NAME
	robotroff - insidious display hack

SYNOPSIS
	robotroff [-h[n]] [-l[n]] [-p[n]] [-i] [-kill]

DESCRIPTION
	Robotroff is yet another display hack from the warped mind
	of Leo Schwab.

	Upon invocation, robotroff installs itself in the background
	and returns your CLI prompt.  It can also be run from the
	WorkBench.  Robotroff continues to run until killed off.
	Robotroff consumes very little CPU, even when active, so it
	may be left running until a reset or power-off.

	Subsequent invocations of robotroff will attempt to locate
	the original invocation, and pass information to it.  Thus,
	it is possible to modify the operating parameters of the
	program while it runs in the background.
	
	The following options are supported:

	-h[n]	Sets the "highwater" time delay length.  The amount
		of time between activity will be no longer than n
		seconds.  If n is not supplied, or is negative or
		zero, a default of two minutes will be used.

	-l[n]	Sets the "lowater" time delay length.  The amount
		of time between activity will be no shorter than n
		seconds.  If n is not supplied, or is negative or
		zero, a default of thirty seconds will be used.

	-p[n]	Sets the task priority.  This permits the user to
		make robotroff consume even less CPU.  If n is
		absent, zero is assumed.

	-i	Force activity to occur right now (immediately).

	-kill	Kills off the original robotroff invocation.
		Robotroff will announce that it has been terminated,
		then exit, freeing all allocated resources.  This
		option is meaningless and therefore ignored if
		supplied when first running robotroff.

	Malformed or unrecognized arguments are silently ignored.

EXAMPLES
	robotroff		Starts background robotroff process.
	robotroff -i		Makes background process active immediately.
	robotroff -h10 -l5	Reconfigures operating parameters.
	robotroff -p-2		Sets priority to -2.
	robotroff -kill		Terminates background process.
