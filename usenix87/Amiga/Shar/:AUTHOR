	Here is a small unshar'ing program that I worked up real quick.
    It does not support directories or atob/btoa shell archives, but
    that may come later depending on demand.  It does work on all the
    different shell archive types I came across and works on both Unix
    and the Amiga.  Have fun and please send any bugfixes/enhancements
    to me!
