This is an updated version of the public domain spreadsheet released recently
by Bob Bond (called at the time: vc (don't flame at me :-)).

This version is designed for people with varying systems:

	1) FIXES A **MAJOR** bug. If you use numbers in the 10000 - 99999
	   range and save the table, then get back in and restore it (P,G)
	   numbers will be rounded to 1 place accuracy (e.g., 12345.67
	   becomes 12345.7 (not too good for taxes!!!)).

	   Simple fix:  replace the two occurances of "%g" in interp.c with
			"%.8g"

	2) uses no TERMCAP file or facilities (expects a VT100 class terminal)
	3) uses no system CURSES package (has its own (sort of) built in)
	4) Runs on any U**X, VMS or AMIGA system (plus probably lots more)
	   (define either VMS, U__X, or MCH_AMIGA to your compiler)
	5) Does not require YACC (output already pre-built)
	6) Does not require nroff (compiled man page provided)

Enjoy!!
