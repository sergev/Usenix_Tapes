	Here is a star-plotting program submitted by Darrin West
(ihnp4!calgary!west).  He seems to be anxious to hear of any bugs
you have, or any fixes/enhancements, so be sure to send them to
him.  If you can't get them to him, I will gladly forward them.
This program requires the use of some datafiles which can be found
in comp.binaries.amiga along with the executable for this program.
