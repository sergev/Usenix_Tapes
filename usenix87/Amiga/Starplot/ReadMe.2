You must type "plot6 to5.bin to5.5.bin ...", listing each file name by
decreasing order of magnitude (increasing number size) in order for
small stars to be plotted first, and allowing larger stars to be
plotted over the smaller ones.

I did find a bug in the input data.  If the width field is greater than
90 degrees (ie 180 degree field of view [I know, I should change
that]), then you look at the southern hemisphere instead of the
northern (given that that is where you wanted to look).  So, for a very
wide field of view, type 80 or 89 degrees.  Less field of view is less
distorted.  I usually use about 60 degrees, as this usually includes
the entire constellation I am looking at.  However, zooming in is fun
too.  (Did you know that one of the stars on the big dipper's handle is
a pair of stars [but not a double]?)

My favorite constellation is Orion.  He can be fould at 83 degrees ra
-3 degrees dc, view him with about 30 degrees of field of view.  Very
interesting!  To see the big dipper type in "0 90 60", it had better be
center stage above center.

	commas inbetween the data you type in.  This is not so, if you do
	not put spaces instead of commas, it gives you a blank screen ]
