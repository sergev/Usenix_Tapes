If you have any of the following stuffed inside your Apple, you have
a vt100 waiting for you:

80 column cards:
	//e 80 column card in the aux slot
	//c 80 column display (built-in)
	Computer Stop (Torrance,CA) "Double" or "Omni" Vision 80 col.

Serial cards:
	Apple Super Serial card (in slot 2)
	Apple //c serial port (built-in)
	ALS Dispatcher serial card
	Generic card compatible with the Pascal calling protocol

>>>> Basically, it works like vt100. Period. <<<<

If you can't download or can't get it to work, (as a service) I 
will send you a working disk complete with source code.  Send a
disk (with mailer) and enough $$ so I can mail it back to you.  If you 
don't want to bother with a disk & mailer, just send $9 (cost of disk, 
mailer, postage, gas, etc..).  The address:  Jim Hayes, P.O. Box 7378, 
La Jolla, CA 92037.  (619) 450-9316.  All requests will be sent-out
between midterms and finals. No requests will be honored after May 1st.
