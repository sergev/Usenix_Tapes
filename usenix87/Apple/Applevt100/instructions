DCOM 3.1     -  Bug reports to ix742%sdcc6@UCSD.EDU

HERE ARE THE QUICKY INSTRUCTIONS:

After successfully unpacking your vt100 emulator, run the startup
program "HELLO".

You will be greeted with a message asking you to hit <RETURN> to start
the terminal, or <ESC> to configure the terminal.  Type <ESC>.

You will be asked 4 questions:

  1) Your 80 column screen type.
  2) Your serial card type.
  3) Save configuration or abort.
  4) Exit to DOS or run terminal.

When you run the terminal, your default drivers will be loaded, and
the message "Go..." will appear on the screen, indicating that you are
now a vt100 talking to your (probably Hayes compatible) modem.  Dial
your site and login as usual.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Vt100 special keys:

A word on notation: OA/CA means Open Apple or Closed Apple.  For you
Apple ][/][+ use paddle buttons 1 or 2. When this notation is used,
press and HOLD the open or closed apple button and strike the key
requested..

Special keys:

Apple keyboard key			Actual vt100 key

OA/CA K,k or [UP ARROW] 		[UP ARROW]
  "   J,j or [DOWN ARROW]		[DOWN ARROW]
  "   H,H or [LEFT ARROW]		[LEFT ARROW]
  "   L,l or [RIGHT ARROW]		[RIGHT ARROW]

  "   Q,q    				[Pf1]
  "   W,w				[Pf2]    
  "   E,e				[Pf3]
  "   R,r				[Pf4]

  "   B,b 				[BREAK]  (Sends break if possible)
  "   <ESC>				[SET-UP]

To send the vt100 keypad key codes, hold down the open or closed apple
key and type the number or digit on your regular Apple keyboard.
i.e.:

Apple keyboard key			Actual vt100 key

OA/CA  1				[KEYPAD 1]
OA/CA  <RETURN>				[KEYPAD ENTER]
OA/CA  ,				[KEYPAD ,]
etc...


-----------------------------------------------------------------------
SET-UP Menu:

Get there by OA/CA <ESC>.  

All options are in plain English and are self explanitory.  Here are
some highlights:

@ - Exits the terminal

R - Resets (rather spectacularly) the terminal to a usable state.
    This is useful when phone-line noise has put the terminal in
    reverse video, line drawing character set, or insert mode.

M - Gives you the serial (modem) transmission parameters.
    (when N/A appears by an option, you hard does not allow the
     setting of this option by software. i.e. Use dipswitches on card
     instead.)

S - Save terminal codes upon exit. (see '@' above.)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Basically:  Use this as if you were typing at a vt100 in your office.

If any more information is desired, (619) 450-9316 until June of this
year.

					Have fun,
