Instructions for unpacking:

Download the "to.apple" file to a freshly initialized DOS 3.3 
diskette.  When finished, log out and boot the disk with the 
"to.apple" file on it.   At the ']' prompt type:

EXEC TO.APPLE

in about 3 minutes time, all the necessary files will be unpacked 
from "to.apple" and deposited on the disk.  Don't be alarmed if you
don't to see your particular hardware drivers. Some of the drivers
do the work for many hardware configurations.

After your system has pronounced itself sane, and unpacking has
finished, type "RUN HELLO" at the ']' prompt.

For first time use, you need to tell the program what hardware you
have.  So, type <ESC> when asked if you want to start the terminal.

You only have to configure once, and can change the configuration at
any time.  (Continued in the file, "instructions".)
