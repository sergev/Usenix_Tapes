One of my members sent this to me, and having seen several
requests along the same line, I figured I'd post it.. as mayby
someone else can use it... Anyone, for re-writing it in 'C' ?
Another real hacker challenge would be options to send the output
to a printer in -either- bit-image or RLE format... (for those of
us who don't have bit-image printers ;-)... anyway, enjoy..
