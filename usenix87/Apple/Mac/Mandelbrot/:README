[MandelBrot Routine]

For anyone interested in creating their own Mandelbrot set generating
program, the following is a short assembly routine which uses the Mac
II's hardware floating point processor to determine whether a given
point on the complex plane is in the Mandelbrot set.  It is quite fast
(we have found that a full Mac II screen with 150 iterations, and with,
say 20% black pixels, takes about a half hour).  You'll need an MPW to
assemble this.  You'll also need to figure out how to write a user
interface to wrap around this routine...
