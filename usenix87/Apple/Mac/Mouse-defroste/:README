[Mouse defroster (also for old mac)]

As response to the mouse defrosting FKEY posted by Greg Dudek, I decided to
try to adapt it to other (read older) Macs. To locate the same routine Greg
used in the 64 K rom was not difficult, so here the extended FKEY resource,
along with the source files (MDS assembler, but should not be too hard to
convert to other assemblers)

Have fun with it, and if someone extends it to Lisa (if anyone still
has such a beastiie) or the new machines, please post your results....

[Moderator's note:  please look in comp.binaries.mac for the PackIt file that
contains the actual FKEY resource along with the source.]
