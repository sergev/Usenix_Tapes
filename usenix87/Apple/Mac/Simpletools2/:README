[SimpleTools2 Source]

SimpleTools is a set of C functions which greatly simplify the use of the
Macintosh Toolbox.  For example, to have one of your C functions execute
when the user selects the menu File/Quit AND install the menu, the call
would be:  menu ("File", "Quit", my_quit_function).  This sort of thing
is done for menus, windows, dialogs, text-edit, and the standard file
package with lots of little aids.

Included in this new $20 shareware distribution are:
	SimpleTools2.c		SimpleDemo.c		TinyDemo.c
	SimpleTools Doc		SimpleDemo		TinyDemo
	simple.h		SimpleDemo.project	TinyDemo.project

The code is currently maintained for the LightSpeed compiler with compile
time flags for Megamax.  It shouldn't be difficult to port to other
compilers.  The files are packed using PackIt, then textified using
BinHex, then divided into three parts for mailing.  You have to put all
the BinHex jibberish back into one large file before un-BinHexing.

[Moderator's Note:  The full distribution is being made in comp.binaries.mac.
This posting and the one that follows contains the source code for study by
interested folks without a Macintosh.]
