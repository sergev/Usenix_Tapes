[Editor's Note]

Here are the sources and man page for the 'host' side of the UW
window connection. I have successfully compiled and used these with
the ST under BSD4.2 and BSD4.3 on the vax. Not being a SVR2 hacker i
have no idea what it would take to make it run under system 5.

{BUGS}
1) if you logout or exit in a window then the program (on the ST)
will bomb out and leave the host side hung in UW. You end up having
to hang up the phone, redial, and start from scratch.

2) (really a corallary of 1) if you run a program using uwtool and
it fails in any way, then the window will collapse and you will bomb
out as in 1)
