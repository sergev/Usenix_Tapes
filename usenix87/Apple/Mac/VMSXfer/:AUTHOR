The following is a VMS COM file that should be executed on your system.  It
will produce the various files that make up XMAC.
 
Version 2.0 of XMAC has a number of improvements.  Most noteworthy is that
it works well at all baud rates and while you are operating over DECNet (set
host-ed).  A number of other improvements were also thrown in such as in
infomation about your transmission displayed on the terminal, /BELL to have
XMAC signal you that it's done (and you can come back from the other room!),
etc.
 
Again, if you have any questions you can contact Kris Kreutzman, the author,
via me, Michael Peirce (peirce@lll-crg).

$ TYPE SYS$INPUT
TITLE :
Macintosh to DEC VAX using VMS, XMODEM protocol file transfer utility. 

DESCRIPTION :
This program allows users to transfer files between a Apple Macintosh
and a DEC VAX minicomputer running VMS.  Two types of transfers are
possible, TEXT files and Macintosh binary files.  TEXT files are
editable on both computers, but some restrictions apply (see
documentation).  Macintosh binary files can be transfered to the VAX,
and back.  Binary files are stored on the VAX in one file.  Both types
of transfers use the XMODEM protocol provided in the MacTerminal
program for error detection and correction. 

UPDATES FROM LAST REVISION :

1) 9600 baud support.
2) File transfer through a remote host.
3) Better error detection and recovery.
4) Tested under VMS version 4.0 
5) Documentation on XMODEM protocol used by MacTerminal (as I know it).
