This program will give you the following information about Comet Halley:
    - Days to perihelion
    - Right Ascension and Declination
    - Distance to the Sun and Earth
    - Predicted magnitude

The program will prompt you for the the following:
    - Year (respond with 1985, for example)
    - Month (numeric 1 through 12)
    - Day (numeric 1 through 31)

I don't know how "accurate" it is; I haven't checked any of its output
yet with an ephemeris.  I will be able to verify it visually with my
scope around the end of June this year.

Finally, I neither wrote the original basic, nor translated it into C.
I did, however, verify that it compiles under System V, and at least
gives the appearance of giving good data.  Complaints can go to /dev/null.
Suggestions for improvements, corrections, etc can go to me.

Thanks.
