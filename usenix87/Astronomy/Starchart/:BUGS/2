I think I've found inconsistencies between the first file's description of
the field layout and how it's actually done.  Here's how the fields are
described in the first file posted:

> 00000000011111111112222...
> 12345678901234567890123...
> 
> HHMMMSS+DDMM+III12LABEL...

But here's how one of the stars appears:

023113+89150204SSPolaris

It looks like the field layout should actually be:

HHMMSS+DDMM+III12LABEL...

Also, declination is actually given as degrees and minutes while the first file
says it is minutes and seconds.

Finally, the magnitude sign field is either '-' or '0', not '-' or '+' as
described.
