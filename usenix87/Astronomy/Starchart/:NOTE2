This single page PIC/troff file was created from the Yale Bright Star Catalog,
using a star chart utility I wrote recently.

To print, run the file through pic plus troff. Note: pic output is normally
piped into a troff job which runs the -me or -ms macro packages. These packages
may omitted, but warning errors (.PS and .PE macros undefined) will appear.
This should not effect the output.
