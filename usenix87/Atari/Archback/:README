I've compiled this with both Marc Williams C and Megamax with no
problems. Please read the documentation in the program paying
particular attention to the warnings. Two small points I found in

2) the program expects to find the arc program on c:\bin, change the
string arcprog to change the path and/or drive for your system.

the 'wc' for the program (starting with char cpyrid..) is
