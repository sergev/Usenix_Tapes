To: All CP/M-80 freaks.

Here it is, the long awaited CP/M-80-Emulator for the ATARI 520ST:

   - cpmz80.tos

Extract it out of this file. Then uudecode and transfer
it via KERMIT to your ST or the other way round if you want so.
Now you can start the emulator: CPMZ80.TOS. The program
asks you short after starting to put a CP/M disk (a fresh formatted TOS disk)
into the start-disk-drive. Then CP/M-80 is up and running. How
you will get CP/M programs onto your disk, I don't know :-) :-). But
remember: Don't panic. If you get rid of the emulator just type
"EXIT" and change the CP/M-Disk back to a TOS-Disk (the emulator
again asks for that). Now you can go on with TOS.

P.S.: I most correct my previous postings in which I said that it would be
difficult to create CP/M-80 disks. That is not right, a normal formatted
TOS disk will do. Of course (that was my fault) there should not
be any TOS files on it.

P.P.S.: If anybody has any hints to transfer CP/M files to TOS disks, please
let me know!!!!

And now the uuencoded file:
