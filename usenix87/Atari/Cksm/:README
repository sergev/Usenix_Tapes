[Editor's Note]
This is the third of three tools (dumas' uu*code and arc are the
other two) to be used in 'unpacking' postings in this group and
comp.binaries.atari.st. To compile this program on a non-ST computer
make sure that the pre-compiler variable 'vax' is #define'd. I know
that it will compile under Megamax C and Marc Williams on the ST and
under UNIX. The output of the program on the ST looks like:

bytes =      832   cksm =  700   cksblk.c
bytes =     1499   cksm = 2347   cksm.c
Hit return to continue

and on the vax (or other non-ST computer)

bytes =      802(      832)   cksm =  700   /rd/turner/src/cksblk.c
bytes =     1422(     1499)   cksm = 2347   /rd/turner/src/cksm.c
Hit return to continue

The first number is the size of the file on the vax, the second
(number) is the size of the file on the ST. The difference is due to
the access routines on the ST adding a <CR> for every <LF> that they
read in an ascii file. The checksums however match and thats what
really counts. The binaries for the ST will be posted to
comp.binaries.atari.st.
