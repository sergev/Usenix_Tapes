This is an emulation of the curses library in UNIX. It is a series of
library routines which allows the user to control cursor positioning
and output of characters in one or more 'windows'. A curses window is
defined as a rectangular area of the screen whose size is as small as 1
char or as large as the whole screen.

Despite what Rene says in his comments, I have not been able to get
this to work under anything but Alcyon C. MWC compiles but will not
execute properly and Megamax aborts with compile errors. I'm afraid
that I am too far behind as it is and can not spend any more time
trying to port this. Perhaps some kind soul......

There is one change that needs to made for this to work under Alcyon C,
the size of the stack in gemstart.s must be increased from 500 to
10000. The place to do this is fairly easy to find since it is 
commented in the sources. 

The cksm for the arc is:

bytes =    62923(    63283)   cksm = 2796   curses.arc

Hello, here is the curses package I promised a week ago.
Uudecode, un-arc and read readme.txt and curses.doc.
I've tested it with DRI/Alcyon-C only, but it should be portable
among most C-compilers. 
Testing curses has been done with the recently posted rogue,
which was also the main incentive to write it.
