This is a disassembler for Atari 6502 binary files.  It attempts to trace
execution flow before printing the information in order to avoid disassembling
the data parts of the program.  The disassembler also accepts equate files
so that you can see references to known locations by their names.  A cross
reference is printed at the end.

The program was compiled and tested on a Vax running BSD4.2.  I have not
attempted to run it on anything else.  It keeps lots of data around as
it traces; the binary on the vax is about 220k.  It uses lex, although
the input rules are very simple.  A custom scanner would probably be easy;
if anyone builds one, I would love to see it.

Please direct comments and questions to me at nsc!nscpdc!rgb or 
tektronix!nscpdc!rgb.
