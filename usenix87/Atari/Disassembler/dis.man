     NAME
          dis6502 - Disassemble 6502 object code

     SYNOPSIS
          _d_i_s_6_5_0_2 [ -_b ] [ -_p _p_f_i_l_e ] _f_i_l_e

     DESCRIPTION
          _D_i_s_6_5_0_2 disassembles 6502 binary files.  Binary formats
          understood include Atari binary files (L menu command) and
          boot files.  Equate and control files can be included via
          the -_p option to name well known locations and to control
          the dissassembly process.  The output includes a cross
          reference.

          The dissassembly process is a two pass operation:  First the
          program flow is traced starting with the init and run
          parameters in the file headers.  The dump routine then
          prints out the information.

          The command line options are:

          -_b   Assume that the file is a boot file, not a load file.

          -_p _p_f_i_l_e
               Read in the predefine file _p_f_i_l_e.  Up to 20 -_p options
               may be included.

          Lines in pfile consist of:

           lineno name .eq number

           .stop number

           .trace number

          _L_i_n_e_n_o refers to a decimal number. _N_u_m_b_e_r may be a decimal
          number or may be a hexadecimal number (the first character
          of the number should be "$").  For example, "$21b5" is the
          hexadecimal number 21b5.  _N_a_m_e is a sequence of numbers and
          characters starting with a letter.  ._t_r_a_c_e causes the trace
          process to continue at the address given. ._s_t_o_p causes the
          trace process to stop at the address given.
