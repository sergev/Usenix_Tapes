Here is a fast (400,000 cell-generations/s) life program for monochrome
Atari-ST computers (which should port easily to other 68000 machines).

It animates all 240,000 pixels on the screen.  Feel free to add a
better user-interface!

But how does it go so fast?  It sums the neighbours of 32 cells in one
pass, by synthesizing addition instructions out of logical operators.

The rest of this file is a shar containing
	life.c		- mainline
	gen.s		- quickly compute next generation
	life.uue	- uuencoded life.prg (Atari ST only)

Have fun!
