The following is a 'make' utility for the Atari 520ST.
Please read the readme file before attempting to compile it.

If there are people who would like to use this but don't have
a C compiler send me email (at the address at the end of this
message, rather than that in the header) and I will send you the
uuencoded binary.

This would be much more useful in conjunction with a shell program.
If anyone is working on a shell I would be interested in adapting
this utility to function smoothly with it - send me some mail if
you are interested.
