 James Omura suggested the use of the Motorola S1 format for
 transfer of binary files.  This will work fine as long as the
 file is 64k or less.  Of course if it is greater than 64k it
 probably is too big to send across the net anyway.  The following
 programs were written by Budd Pass and can be used to load and unload
 binary files.  They were written for the 6809 but are also in use
 on several flavors of UNIX.  You may use these progams if you desire,
 but no responsibility is assumed or implied.  Any comments found in them
 are personal and can not be construed as either support or non support
 of the various opperating systems or anyone else alive or dead.
