Below is a small set of utilities writen to work with DEGAS for the ST
I have only used them on a monochrome monitor and don't have access to
colour system.  The Xor and And and Or utilities might come up with some 
interesting effects on a colour screen.  They are pretty well self-
explanatory and can be compiled with the developers package C compiler.
Have fun and let me know how they work in colour..  Kim.
