	Here is ST COMM again.  I have fixed/improved it a little.  I have
tried mailing it to the individuals that requested it, but individual mail
doesn't seem to work.  To Michael Jenkings, please send me a copy of your
programs that you mentioned in your letter.  
THIS PROGRAM ONLY COMPILES WITHOUT ERRORS ON THE HABA HIPPO C COMPILER.
Any flames about portable code to /dev/null.  
If the source looks strange during download, DONN'T PANIC! Load it into the
Haba Hippo C editor 'ed'.  It should look OK there.  I think that the 
Haba ed inserts some strange characters in files.  By the way, this 
program was created using the Haba editor 'ed'.  
Please let me know about any problems/improvements.
