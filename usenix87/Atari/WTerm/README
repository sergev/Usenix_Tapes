WTerm is a simple terminal emulator written using VDI calls that
implements the standard VT52 escape sequences plus several other
features:

        sysline capability for Unix
        insert and delete character commands
        use of light characters for standout mode (more pleasing than
                reverse video)
        TEK 4010 emulation -- not elegant but it works :-)

UNDO to quit and HELP for some (ha) help.

The emulator works fine for baud rates up to and including 2400
baud.  The emulator is designed for the monochrome monitor and
will not work on a colour system without changes.  Sorry --
however, this was a learning experience for me and with luck any
future GEM programs I write will not have such limitations.

The only real problem comes in linking:  the version of APSTART
that I use has a 16k stack.  Anything less seems to cause
problems (or used to at one point in the development of the
program...).

The code is based on a window skeleton program from J. Lang.
The original version of WTerm used windows, but I found this to
be too slow so went to full screen -- as a result, several
pieces of the code are either not needed or could be improved
dramatically.  Caveat emptor!

The following is a TERMCAP entry for this terminal:

In order to create the executable, compile each piece separately using
the DRI C compiler and then link by

	link68 [co[wterm.inp]]
	relmod wterm

and that's all folks!  Enjoy.  For those that require the executable
directly, please mail me a message.  I prefer not to post executables.
Please do not flame me on this.
