[Editor's Note]
Here are the sources for the xmdm program posted to comp.binaries, John
claims that he compiled them under DRI C. My version most be (more ?) 
brain damaged because I couldn't get main.c to compile. In other words
'the proof is left to the reader' boy how I hated that phrase. But I 
digress, here is the cksm

bytes =    35840(    36001)   cksm = 3215   xmdmsrc.arc

+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=

So I am sure this stuff will work.  But, I tried them on the old Alcyon
and new Alcyon compilers and found that the xmdm.prg derived from the old
worked fine but the xmdm.prg from the new compiler locked up upon entering
the terminal emulator.
