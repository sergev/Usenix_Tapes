                Aviation Navigation Program and Database


This program will compute the rhumbline equivalent of a great circle
route between two points. The program uses two databases - one contains
information on airports, the other contains information about VORs and
VORTACS. The program will compute either an RNAV course from waypoint to
waypoint or will plot a course from VOR to VOR. In the RNAV mode any VORs 
given (as opposed to VORTACS) will be used as the waypoint.

The output of the program consists of a Flight Guide that gives True and
Magnetic course, From - To pairs, VOR[TAC] frequency, radial and distance
for RNAV, leg distance and total distance, and leg time and elapsed time. 
If the program is given the aircraft altitude and true airspeed the output 
will include true slant range rather than distance from the VORTAC for 
RNAV and duration for each leg and for the total flight.

The airports and vors files are ASCII text files. The format for each
file is given at the head of each file. You may add airports or vors
and vortacs to the files. The current files include coverage for 
California, Oregon and Nevada.

The program is created by invoking "make". After the make is completed
the executable file "nav" will exist. The program has several options -

  -from <id>            the <id> of the airport the flight starts from.
  -to <id>              the <id> of the airport the flight terminates at.
  -via <id>..<id>       the <id>s of the VORs to use for navigation. 
                        Use either -via or -rvia, not both.
  -rvia <id>..<id>      the <id>s of VORTACs to use for RNAV. If an <id>
                        is not a VORTAC, the waypoint will be over the VOR.
                        Use either -rvia or -via, not both.
  -alt <feet>..<feet>   the altitude in feet for each leg of the flight. If
                        the -alt option is used, the RNAV distance from the
                        VORTAC will be actual slant range. If -alt is not
                        used, the RNAV distance with be horizontal range.
                        If there are fewer altitudes listed than legs then
                        the last supplied altitude will be used for the 
                        remaining legs of the flight.
  -speed <kts>..<kts>   the expected TAS in knots for each leg of the flight.
                        If the -speed option is used, the output will show
                        expected ground speed and time for each leg, as well
                        as elapsed time for the flight. If there are fewer
                        speeds listed than legs then the last speed supplied
                        will be used for the remainder of the legs.
  -wind <wind>..<wind>  the <wind> is in the same format as the "winds aloft"
                        forcast. For instance, 3320 is read as winds from 330
                        degrees (true north) at 20 knots. The <wind> is used
                        to adjust both the magnetic course and ground speed
                        for each leg of the flight. If there are fewer wind
                        entries supplied than legs for the flight then the
                        last supplied wind entry will be used for each 
                        remaining leg of the flight.
  -com                  print the comments that apply to each <id>.
  -airports             print the airports database.
  -vors                 print the vors database.
  -k <string>           grep the airports and vors databases for <string>.

    This program was originally posted by Linn Hower. He got it from
    an anonymous source. Linn modified the program somewhat, and then
    I modified it substantially. Please remember - ALWAYS check the
    output for reasonable results by comparing the listed flight
    against a WAC or SECTIONAL chart.
