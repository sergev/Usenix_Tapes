This is an improved version of the acucntrl program used in the dialinout
modifications to uucp that I posted a month or two ago.  There were some
bugs that were fixed.  The changes are described in the RCS $Log$ in
the comments.  To run it needs to be installed suid to root.

The modifications are to the version of uucp and tip distributed in 4.2 BSD and
allow the same modems to be used to both dial out and to receive incoming
calls.   Similar modifications had earlier been made in the 4.1 BSD uucp,
and have now been made in the Honey DanBer version of uucp.  All of these
things use this acucntrl program.
