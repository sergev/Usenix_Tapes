Following is what we came up with to do that on Pyramid 90x with Hayes modem... 
can probably be hacked for other systems.  Note that it must be installed
setuid root (so it can write to /dev/itp0) and must be executed from login
shell via exec.  To avoid problems where someone happens to login on the line
before the program calls back the original user, it executes login when done...
