Dial is a (4.xBSD-only) communications program for tty lines.  It is
similar to tip(1), though it doesn't support as many options as tip and
no file transfer.  In addition to interactive access to a remote
computer, dial can operate in a non-interactive way using a
user-supplied state transition script.  This is useful for accessing
certain `server logins' on remote machines without human interaction
and in cases where the connect/login procedure for a remote computer is
complex, e.g. when a remote system is accessed through a PABX, LAN, or
terminal selector.

Compile dial using the following command:
    cc -o dial dial.c -ltermcap
(the termcap library is solely used to read entries from /etc/remote).

`dial.1' contains the manual page for dial.

`example' contains a sample state transition script that can be
interpreted by dial.  It is probably of no particular use for you; we
are using it here to connect to a server login on a remote UNIX machine
through our local PABX (see the comments in `example').  But you can
get an idea how a dial script looks like.

Dial makes use of select(2), remote(5), and the Berkeley-UNIX tty
driver.  Thus, it is probably impossible to port it to non-BSD
systems.  I don't know if it will run under 4.3BSD (we haven't
got 4.3 here, yet).
