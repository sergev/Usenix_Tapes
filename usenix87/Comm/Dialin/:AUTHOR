Below is a program that creates a /usr/spool/uucp/LCK file for the
phone line being used by a dialed-in user.  The 7300 shares one
line for outgoing uucp and cu and incoming users.  Outgoing processes
will just hang up on a remote user when they decide they want the phone
unless an LCK file is there.

The program is to be run out of the /etc/profile when the dial-in user
is selecting his terminal type.  It creates the LCK file, then puts a
reaper child to sleep.  When the line is eventually hung up, the child
gets a HUP, wakes up, deletes the lock file and exits.
