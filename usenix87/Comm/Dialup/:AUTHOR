Since I have a terrible memory for which phone number goes to which
database and which login name goes with which password I made a
crutch.  dialup allows a user to remember only the service name.
It then looks in a simple database in the user's home directory for
the dialing information and places the call via cu(1).  It will also
list the login name and password for the service unless supressed
with the '-s' option.

Enjoy,
