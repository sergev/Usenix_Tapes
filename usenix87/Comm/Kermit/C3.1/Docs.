In view of the recent interest in KERMIT, I am posting two documents from
Columbia University showing the availability of KERMIT. Most of the
files are available through an anonymous ftp from COLUMBIA-20 after
6 P.M. EST and on weekends

              COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY CENTER FOR COMPUTING ACTIVITIES

                       THE KERMIT FILE TRANSFER PROTOCOL

                                September 1984


KERMIT is a protocol for transferring sequential files between computers of all
sizes over ordinary asynchronous telecommunication lines using packets,  check-
sums, and retransmission to promote data integrity.  KERMIT is non-proprietary,
thoroughly documented, well tested, and in wide use.    The  protocol  and  the
original  implementations  were  developed at Columbia University and have been
shared with many other institutions, some of which have made  significant  con-
tributions  of their own.  KERMIT is presently available for the following sys-
tems, with others under development:

The 8080 version runs on the DEC VT180, DECmate II (CP/M), Heath/Zenith-89  and
100,  Superbrain,  Apple II/Z80, TRS-80 II (CP/M), Osborne, Kaypro, and others.
There are 8086 MS DOS versions for the IBM PC, DEC  Rainbow,  Wang  PC,  Heath/
Zenith-100,  HP-150,  NEC  APC,  Tandy 2000, Victor 9000, and others.  The 8086
CP/M-86 version runs on the DEC Rainbow and the NEC APC.

KERMIT DISTRIBUTION POLICY:  The KERMIT software is free and available to  all.
Columbia  University, however, cannot afford to distribute free software on the
scale required for KERMIT.  Therefore, to defray our costs for media, printing,
postage,  labor,  and computing resources, we must request a moderate distribu-
tion fee from sites that request KERMIT directly from us.  The schedule  is  as
follows:

    Complete KERMIT Distribution            $100.00
       (Includes Tape, User Guide, and Protocol Manual)
    Printed Documents                       $  5.00 each
       (User Guide, Protocol Manual, BYTE Article Manuscript,
        or Any Program Source Listing)
    Order Processing Fee                    $100.00
       (Omit this if you send a check with your order)


The  User  Guide  contains  complete  instructions for installing and using the
major implementations of KERMIT.  The Protocol Manual is a guide for writing  a
new  implementation of KERMIT, and includes a source listing in the C language.
The BYTE manuscript is from the KERMIT article in the June and July 1984 issues
of BYTE Magazine.

Other  sites remain free to redistribute KERMIT on their own terms, and are en-
couraged to do so, with the following stipulations: KERMIT should not  be  sold
for  profit; credit should be given where it is due; and new material should be
sent back to Columbia University at the address below so that we can maintain a
definitive  and  comprehensive  set  of KERMIT implementations for further dis-
tribution.


To order KERMIT from Columbia University, send a letter requesting the  manuals
or source listings you desire (specify each one), or a 9-track magnetic tape in
one of the following formats:

    System         Tape Format                            Densities
    VAX/VMS        ANSI Label, Format ``D'' (VMS COPY)    1600
    UNIX           TAR                                    1600
    TOPS-10        BACKUP/Interchange, Unlabeled          1600, 6250
    TOPS-20        DUMPER, Unlabeled                      1600, 6250
    IBM VM/CMS     EBCDIC, CMS Format                     1600, 6250
                      or EBCDIC, OS Standard Label        1600, 6250
    All Others     ASCII, ANSI Label, Format ``D''        1600

(Specify system, format, and density.)  One copy of each  manual  will  be  in-
cluded with the tape.  We will supply the tape, packaging, and postage.

We  can  only  make  tapes  in  the  formats  listed  above.    We  cannot make
fixed-record format, 800bpi, or unlabled tapes; there are too many Kermit files
for  such  tapes.  We cannot produce floppy disks; bootstrapping procedures are
provided to  allow  the  microcomputer  versions  to  be  downloaded  from  the
mainframe  for  which  the tape is produced.  The tape includes sources for ALL
the Kermit programs, plus documentation, and, when practical, binaries or  hex.
Unfortunately,  our  limited resources to not allow us to provide automatic up-
dates to KERMIT recipients when  new  implementations,  documentation,  or  bug
fixes appear.

Send your letter to:

  KERMIT Distribution
  Columbia University Center for Computing Activities  <- Make check payable to
  7th Floor, Watson Laboratory
  612 West 115th Street
  New York, N.Y.  10025

Please  list  the  machines  and operating systems you expect to run KERMIT on,
specify the tape format or the listings desired, and mention whether there  are
additional  systems  for which you require KERMIT or if you might be interested
in attempting your own implementation for a new system.

KERMIT is also available to users of the BITNET network via a  server  at  host
CUVMA  (BITNET  users  type  ``SMSG  RSCS  MSG CUVMA KERMSRV HELP'' for further
information) and of ARPANET (via anonymous FTP from host  COLUMBIA-20,  in  the
area KER:), and from user groups like DECUS, SHARE, PC-SIG.

No  warranty of the software nor of the accuracy of the documentation surround-
ing it is expressed or implied, and neither the authors nor Columbia University
acknowledge any liability resulting from program or documentation errors.
