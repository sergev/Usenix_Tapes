	Somebody out there posted a request for Kermit on
the Fortune 32:16.  Such as it may be this version works
well for us even though it is sloppy.  Please note that
this copy is designed to work with the Fortune hooked up to 
a Sytek box and configured so that DTR causes hangups/session
aborts.  This problem is bypassed by having a working
command line within the program.

	Good luck and have fun!
