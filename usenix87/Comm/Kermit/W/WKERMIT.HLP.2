WKERMIT (which actually calls itself PCKERMIT, but is not stored under that
name in the Kermit Distribution) is an adaptation of an old version of
C-Kermit (originally written for UNIX) to PC-DOS for the IBM PC, XT, and AT,
which implements the sliding window extension to the Kermit protocol.  It
was done by Jan van der Eijk of NUS for The Source Telecomputing, and is the
companion piece to The Source's own Prime Kermit, which also does sliding
windows.

Since Jan did not follow the coding or naming conventions used in C-Kermit,
or in the Kermit distribution itself, and since his code was based on a
superseded release of C-Kermit, and since it requires a commercial package
(the Greenleaf communication library) in order to build it, his code has not
been incorporated into C-Kermit.  However, it is expected that MS-DOS
support as well as sliding windows will be added to C-Kermit in the future,
at which time this version will no longer be needed.

Meanwhile, WKERMIT may be used on the IBM PC family in conjunction with
other Kermit programs, and especially in conjunction with those that "do
windows".  Several points to be aware of, however:

. The program does NOT do XON/XOFF (this was not supported by the
  Greenleaf library at the time the program was written).

. A modem is required.  The program insists upon seeing carrier and other
  appropriate modem signals.  If you want to use this program over a
  direct connection, you'll have to fake these signals, e.g. by cross
  connecting CD and DTR in the connector.

. Be sure you have a compatible Kermit program on the other end, set up
  correctly for the desired operation, before giving a command to WKERMIT.
  Otherwise, it will take forever to time out and return to command mode.
  There is no apparent way to interrupt it while it is trying to make a
  protocol connection to the remote Kermit.

Incidentally, WKERMIT has been sent by The Source to a number of software
houses in the form of a "Kermit Development Kit" to encourage them to add
Kermit windows capability to their communication packages.  Some of them
have already done this.

Since it might not be possible to build this program from the sources provided,
a "BOO" file is also provided, which is a printable encoding of the .EXE file.
To produce the .EXE file, first make sure you have plenty of disk space, then
get the .BOO file onto your PC (using Kermit or some other file transfer
protocol), and also get the files MSBPCT.BAS and MSBPCT.BOO.  Then:

1. Use MSBPCT.BAS to translate MSBPCT.BOO into MSBPCT.EXE.

2. Type "msbpct wkermit.boo"

After a minute or so you should have a usable WKERMIT.EXE on your disk.
See the MS-DOS Kermit documentation for further information about BOO files.
