In response to numerous requests, here is are the latest versions of
the Unix/Xenix/Vemnix/Coherent/Regulus rb and sb programs.  The man
pages have been extensively revised since their last posting.

Rb and sb support XMODEM and YMODEM protocol text and binary file transfers
to (rb) and from (sb) Unix systems.  YMODEM supports batch transfers,
1k packets with YMODEM programs such as YAM, IMP, MEX, and others.  Sb supports
YMODEM-g streaming protocol for even greater efficiency downloading
from Unix to Pro-YAM, twice as fast as XMODEM at 9600 bps.

Ready to print versions of the manual pages are included with the VMS
sources being posted at the same time.
