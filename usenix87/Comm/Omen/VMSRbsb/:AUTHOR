In response to numerous requests, here is are the latest versions of
the VAX rb and sb programs.  The man
pages have been extensively revised since their last posting.

Rb and sb support XMODEM and YMODEM protocol text and binary file transfers
to (rb) and from (sb) Unix systems.  YMODEM supports batch transfers,
1k packets with YMODEM programs such as YAM, IMP, MEX, and others.

Nroff/Troff sources of the manual pages are included with the Unix sources
being posted at the same time.
