If you've every tried to intercept and stop outgoing mail by
removing the three C.* and D.* files created by uucp, then
this script will help.  The problem comes when there are a
whole bunch of C.* and D.* files in /usr/spool/uucp.  Which
ones are for the specific message you're trying to delete?

Instructions.
1.  Put the following sh script in /usr/spool/uucp/delCD 
2.  To use, find one of the three files you're after.
    Any one of them will do.  For example,
	grep familiar-text-string D*
3.  Use "delCD" with a single argument: the C.* or one of
    the D.* file names.  Example:
	delCD D.heurikoN631f
