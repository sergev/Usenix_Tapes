Here's a new version of the f-proto for uucp. Compared to the one I posted
quite some time ago the major differences are:
- it has been adapted to run cost-effective on X.25 hosts; the old version
  produced too many short packets on such hosts;
- a few minor bugs have been fixed (hence the posting to net.bugs.uucp too).
If you're already running 4.3bsd uucp, you can replace the fio.c by this one
without modifications.
