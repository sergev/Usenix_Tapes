[  A Makefile and manpage wouldn't be sensible for this posting.
   I haven't tested this code; heck, it usually takes strong medicine
   to get me to even _look_ at UUCP code.  Still and all, this may
   be useful, given the recent increase in net interest in writing
   a public-domain UUCP.  --r$  ]

I mentioned on the net that I had written a PAD dialer for UUCP, and
I've had a fair number of requests for it.  I spoke to Rick Adams about
it, and he said that I can post it along with the "f" protocol source
itself.
