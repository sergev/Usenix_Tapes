[  I edited Brandon's cover note into two manpages.  I also threw together
   the quickie Makefile.  The shar file below has two different styles, one
   for my stuff, one for his.  I didn't repack it into one because I liked
   the renaming feature of his.  Note that also included in here is a
   version of the directory-access routines.  -r$ ]

I got an overwhelming response to my announcement of this program.  So, it
comes full circle back to mod.sources.

Uuque has been tested with System III uucp and should work with V7, System
III and most System V uucp's.  It has not been tested with Honey DanBer uucp,
as I don't have access to a system with H/D/B uucp.  If you find out that it
works, or change it so it does, drop me a letter; our computer company may
switch to H/D/B without warning and I'd like to be ready.

It does not yet work under the 4.2BSD uucp.  I am working on this; the program
will dynamically determine whether the structure is ``flat'' or arranged in
directories and act accordingly.  I'll send the new version to mod.sources
when it's done.

It uses getopt, available from the mod.sources archive for non-AT&T UNIX
systems.
