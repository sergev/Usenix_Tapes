If you are like me, by now you've grown tired of issue'n zillions
of uux commands and editing the L.cmds file.

Attached is a shar for 'uush', a remote uucp shell.
Included are:
	uush	-- the local command (front end).
	uush.uu	-- the remote uuxqt'able script (rear end).
	uush.1	-- nroff -man page.

Please read the man page for more details. The program is known to
work on SYSV, BSD4.2, ULTRIX with real UUCP and Honey Danber UUCP.
Course it should cause it does nothing special.

Install notes:
	1) copy uush to /usr/local/bin or where-ever. 
	2) copy uushrc to your $HOME.uushrc (modify it first!!)
	3) copy uush.uu to the remote systems where it will run in
		directory /usr/local/uubin/uush.uu  (if you change the
		place where this file resides, then you'll have to
		put the new file name in uush (where the uux command is).
		You'll also have to make two changes in this script if
		running on BSD -- see header of script (Namely: MAILER,
		TESTER, and LOCAL variables.)
	4) setup your L.cmds or Permissions file to allow execution of
		/usr/local/uubin/uush.uu.

	Note: Read the man page before installing it. The program does
	create interesting security holes as uush.uu is run by uucp.
