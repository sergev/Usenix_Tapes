This is the mangled version of uuslave. I've fixed some parts, and
done my best to provide machine independence. The job is probably
not complete, but it will compile OK on a PC with Lattice C, as 
well as a SUN workstation. (from the ridiculous to the sublime, eh ?)

Anyhow, this is code "as is". It may need some work. If I was a 
dummy anywhere, flame me personally, don't E-mail to the net.
