This shell script was put together the third time
one of my niebours stopped being able to read the uucp
traffic as fast as it was accumulating.  There is a built-
in assumption of subdirectories ( simple style rather
than DEC's ) but it should be easily modified to suit
other configurations.

This is offered "as is" with all usual and/or excessive
disclaimers, because I hate to think anyone would re-invent
the wheel.
