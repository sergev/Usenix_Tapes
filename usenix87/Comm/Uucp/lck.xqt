Your problem is in uuxqt.  Older versions of it do not have a concept of jobs
that take several hours to run.  So, after news has been unbatching for an
hour, a new uuxqt comes along (probably out of crontab), discards the old
LCK.XQT file, and starts up a new unbatching job.  Of course, usually it is
running on the same batch as the previous one.  This continues until the first
uuxqt deletes the X. and D. files;  subsequent uuxqt's then pick up the second
one.  Eventually everything dies down, but I once had an especially heavy
news load (our feed was down) take over 24 hours to unbatch!

The solution is trivial:  add the following lines to your crontab or to your
hourly uucp demon:

    # Ensure that long-running uuxqt's continue to run without interference.
    # ***NOTE*** If uuxqt crashes and a LCK.XQT file gets left hanging around,
    # no more uuxqt's will run until the LCK.XQT file is removed.  This is done
    # by the /etc/rc startup file.

    test -f /usr/spool/uucp/LCK.XQT  &&  touch /usr/spool/uucp/LCK.XQT
