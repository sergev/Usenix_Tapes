To create the two xmodem programs, run:
	make all

To (compile and) install run:
	make install

There are two manual files: xmodtran.1 and xmodrec.1

The two compiled programs, xmodrec and xmodtran, will be moved to the
/usr/local directory.  If this is not where you want them, change the
Makefile $PATH variable to what you want for your system.

The programs are being used on a VAX 750 with BSD 4.2.  They are used
to transfer data between PCs and the VAX.

If you have any questions or comments, send UUCP mail to:
