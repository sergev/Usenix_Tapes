A while ago I asked for X-modem programs for Unix.  I got about 15 programs
in response to my request.  This seems to be the best of the lot. The
source says it for UNIX-to-CP/M, but I use it (slightly modified) with 
AmigaDOS running Online!.

I'm posting it because I got about 100 request to send people
anything I received.

Also I changed this version to work with Online! and my Amiga.  To see
my changes grep for 'wpl'.  I basically changed the EOL from CR/LF to LF,
that's all.

Good luck,
wpl
