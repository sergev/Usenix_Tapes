Here's the first version of the promised driver for the DHU-11.
This version runs happily on an 11/750 under 4.2, and should (probably)
run on other VAXen and under ULTRIX, although none of this has been
tested.

The principal limitation of this release is that it does not attempt
to handle the sophisticated modem facilities provided by the DHU-11.
This will come later, time permitting.

In the meantime, use this and let me know of any problems encountered.
