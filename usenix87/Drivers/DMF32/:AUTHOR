The remainder of this file (up to the .signature part) is a shell
script which will extract a 4.2BSD DMF32 driver.  This code is known to
work properly with Emulex CS21Fs (on which you can disable the line
printer driver, since it's not in the hardware) and with DEC DMF32s,
though I have not tested the line printer code.  It also includes the
U of MD ``outgoing mode'' code (which uses an extra cdevsw table entry).
If you wish to take advantage of the ``dial'' portion of the driver,
add a line to your config file of the form

	pseudo-device dmfo

and add a cdevsw entry in /sys/vax/conf.c that is like the dmf entry,
but uses dmfoopen and dmfoclose as the first two routines (note that
you will also need to declare them as int functions).  This is done in
the same way as for the outgoing mode DZ mods I posted earlier.

And now for our show:
