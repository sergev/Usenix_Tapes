The following is an implementation of /dev/stdin as described by
Rob Pike last week at Usenix. For those of you who weren't there,
/dev/stdin, when opened, dups file descriptor 0. This eliminates
the need for programs to treat the file name "-" as a special
case meaning the standard input.

To install this code, change the third field of the line for "memory"
in /etc/master from 6 to 26. Apply the following diff to io/mem.c.
This is from the ns32000 port so your file may vary somewhat.
