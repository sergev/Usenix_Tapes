#

#	Finally. This part 1 of the TU58 emulator program mentioned on the
#	USENET about a month ago. Due to great demand, we are posting it.
#	You are free to use it except for commercial advantage (don't sell
#	it). Its basic usage is:
#
#		tu58 -s9600 serial_device tu58_filesystem0 [filesystem1] &
#
#	where "serial_device" is a tty line the other end of which will look
#	like a TU58 and the two filesystems are UNIX files which contain the
#	image of the TU58 drives to be emulated. Of course /etc/getty must
#	not be running on the tty line.
#
#	This program has been extensively used to provide TU58-like mass
#	storage for otherwise standalone DEC PDP-11/23's and 11/03's. It has
#	been used to provide bootable RT-11 filesystems, but there is no
#	reason why any TU58 filesystem couldn't be emulated (e.g. 11/750
#	diagnostic supervisor).
#
#	On a VAX 11/750 running 4.2BSD, the character handling is not quite
#	fast enough to handle writes into the emulator. Writes do work at
#	2400 and 4800 baud. It is still much faster than a real TU58 for
#	most applications since the average access time on a real TU58 is
#	30 seconds. It boots RT-11 in less than 30 seconds - a real TU58 takes
#	more than 5 minutes
#
#	If anyone needs a bootable RT-11 TU58 image (and has an RT-11 license)
#	we could probably send you one. They run about 256kbytes each.
#
#	I have included the rtpip utility which we use to write these RT-11
#	filesystems on the UNIX host side.
#
#	Areas for improvement. If anyone knows about or make mods towards
#	these items, please feed it back to us.
#
#		- A real TU58 contains 512blocks of 512bytes. Is this limited
#		by the TU58 protocol. Could the emulator meanfully support
#		larger filesystems ? It looks like there is 16bit block #s.
#
#		- A real TU58 has one or two drives. Can the protocol support
#		more than two drives ? It looks like there is 8bit unit #s.
#
#		- Would a stripped down tty line discipline (e.g. the Purdue
#		8bit line discipline) allow the TU58 to be more efficient
#		and possibly allow writes at 9600baud ?
#
#		- Does anyone have a TU58 UNIX driver for the (absolutely)
#		crazy idea of running UNIX off the emulator ? (or maybe
#		XINU)
#
#		- It sometimes crashes, especially after long (hours, days)
#		of idle time, probably due to noise/garbage on the line.
#		It could probably use improvements in this area. A quick
#		hack which we'll probably add is to restart (either re-exec()
#		or longjmp()) itself when it gets a e.g. SIGTERM or SIGHUP
#		to allow easy restarting in case it hangs.
#
#		- It should work for VAX 750 diags. Let us know if it does.
#
#	Let us know how it works out.
