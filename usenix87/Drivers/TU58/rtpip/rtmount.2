.sh DESCRIPTION
.s3
.it Rtmount
announces to the system that a removable RT-11 file system
has been mounted on the block structured special file
.it special;
usually disk or DECtape.
.s3
.it Special
must be a fully specified special file name, e.g /DEV/RK1.
.s3
The
.it rwflag
argument determines how the file system has to be mounted. If it is
0, read is allowed; if it is 1, write is allowed, and if it is 2,
update (read and write) is allowed.
.s3
The
returned file descriptor of the mounted special file can be saved, but
in most cases the caller won't need it anymore.

.sh DIAGNOSTICS
From C, a -1 gets returned if mounting fails, e.g. if any RT-11 device
is already mounted. It is not possible to have more than one RT-11
device mounted at the same time.
