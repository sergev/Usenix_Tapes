.sh NAME
rtpip - manipulate RT-11 files from UNIX
.sh SYNOPSIS
.bd rtpip
key [ file ... ]
.sh DESCRIPTION
.it key
consists of two or three characters;
.it file
is either a UNIX filename or an RT-11 filename.
RT-11 filenames must be preceded immediately by a '+'
and UNIX filenames must have standard shell formats.
The meanings of the
.it key
characters are:
.s3
The first character is the function to be performed:
.s3
.bd r
copy the file(s) to the RT-11 device.
.s3
.bd x
copy the file(s) from the RT-11 device.
.s3
.bd l
list the directory of the RT-11 device on the standard output.
If no filename is given, the entire directory will be listed.
.s3
.bd e
same as l, but list only filenames with extension as given by
the filename argument(s) (+EXT or +EXT.).
.s3
.bd n
same as l, but list only filenames with name-part as given by
the filename argument(s) (+.FILNAM or +FILNAM).
.s3
.bd f
list, on the standard output, the sizes of all empty entries on the RT-11 device.
.s3
.bd d
delete the RT-11 file(s).
.s3
The second character identifies the RT-11 device:
.s3
.bd r
/dev/rkx RK disk
.s3
.bd k
/dev/rkx RK disk
.s3
.bd l
/dev/rlx RL disk
.s3
.bd p
/dev/rpx RP disk
.s3
.bd x
/dev/rxx RX floppy disk
.s3
.bd h
/dev/hkx RK06/07 disk
.s3
.bd f
disk file dkx
.s3
.bd t
/dev/tapx DECtape
.s3
If none of the device keys are present, 'p' (RP disk) is assumed.
.s3
The next key character, which must be present, specifies the device unit number:
.s3
.bd 0-9

.sh DIAGNOSTICS
If appropriate, rtpip tries to match pairs of UNIX and RT-11 filenames
in the sequence in which
they occur in the
.it file
argument. If there is a UNIX or RT-11 filename without
corresponding filename from the other side, the same name is taken.
If the UNIX name contains slashes, all characters up to and including the last
slash are disregarded, and the result is taken as the RT-11 filename.
