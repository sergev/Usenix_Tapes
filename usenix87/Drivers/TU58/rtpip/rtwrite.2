.th RTWRITE II 1/1/76
.sh NAME
rtwrite *- write on RT-11 file
.sh SYNOPSIS
.br
.ft B
rtwrite (fildes, buffer, nbytes)
.br
char *buffer;
.br
.ft R
.sh DESCRIPTION
A file descriptor is a word returned from a successful
.it rtopen.
.it Buffer
is the address of
.it nbytes
contiguous bytes which are written on the output
file.
Unlike the normal UNIX 
.it write
function, an end-of-file can occur because
RT-11 has contiguous files of finite size. Therefore
the returned value indicates the number of characters
actually written.
.s3
Writes which are multiples of 512 characters long
and begin on a 512-byte boundary in the file are more
efficient than any others.
.sh FILES
In Nymegen,
.it rtwrite
is in the C-library (member name RTUN.O).
