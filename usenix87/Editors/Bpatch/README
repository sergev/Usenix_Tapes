Herewith find BPATCH - a marvelously utile utility.  While not of
my original creation, I have been given permission to place in the
public domain.  I have made substantial modifications to the original
source given to me.  Specifically I cleaned it up a bit and made it
work with SVR2 curses.  Personally, I think it's pretty neat.

OK - for those of you who may scream by now "WHAT THE HELL IS IT ALREADY?"
I respond that it is a binary file editor and dump utility!  That's 
right!  You can dump your file in the nicely laid out side-by-side
hex and ascii format or you can actually EDIT it at your terminal!
Yes, I have seen the BED editor that came across the network.
Unfortunately, it converted the entire file before and after editing.
Bpatch, on the other hand, works with one 256 byte page at a time.
It is marvelously useful for looking at things like raw disk UNIFY
databases and even raw disks!  While the man page may not be absolutely
up to date, the online help is.  Try the question mark (?) command.

As always, I would love to hear about bugs/changes/enhancements/requests.

Addition by the moderator:
I have added code, surrounded by #ifdef MOD_HAX, that gets bpatch
(barely?) working on my 4.2 system.  I would be very interested in
publishing a set of diffs that's less of a hack.  Oh yeah:  I also
wrote the Makefile.
