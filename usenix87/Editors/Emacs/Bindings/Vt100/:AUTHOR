(reposting because cursor bindings were wrong -- sorry)
This is a keypad binding for emacs on a vt100 or lookalike.
It requires Unipress (Gosling) emacs version 2.
It takes some "finger training"  to use it effectively.
It is designed for my main emacs activity: document preparation.
Programmers might want to modify it somewhat. 
Permission to modify and further distribute is unconditionally given.
