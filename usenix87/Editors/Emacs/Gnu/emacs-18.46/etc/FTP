How to get GNU Software by Internet FTP or by UUCP.  Last updated 30 Jan 1987

* No Warranties

We distribute software in the hope that it will be useful, but
without any warranty.  No author or distributor of this software
accepts responsibility to anyone for the consequences of using it or
for whether it serves any particular purpose or works at all, unless
he says so in writing.

* Updates

If you find this file in the Emacs distribution, there is a chance
it is out of date.  If you plan to FTP files from prep.ai.mit.edu,
you might as well start by FTPing the current version of this file,
which is `/u2/emacs/etc/FTP'.

* FTPing GNU Software

** GNU Emacs and How To FTP It

If you are on the Internet (note also "** Alternative Internet FTP
Sources" below), you can at present copy the latest distribution
version of GNU Emacs from the file /u2/emacs/edist.tar on host
prep.ai.mit.edu (or the file /u2/emacs/edist.tar.Z which has been run
through compress after tar).  These files are about 7 and 3 megabytes
long, respectively.  After you unpack the distribution, be sure to
look at the files README and INSTALL.

Because of difficulties in transferring large files, often a split
version of the tar file is created.  This is a directory named
/u2/emacs/edist.tar-MM.NN-split or perhaps
/u2/emacs/edist.tar-MM.NN.Z-split, containing files of 100000
characters each.  There is generally no trouble in ftping files of
this size.  They can be combined with cat to make a tar file or
compressed tar file.

Some ftp'ers have found it necessary for successful file transfer:
   - to set the binary/image mode
   - to use another of prep.ai.mit.edu internet addresses than the
default for your machine.  They are (as of 22 Oct 86):
  128.52.14.14
  128.52.22.14
  128.52.32.14

Files of differences from previous widely distributed GNU Emacs
versions to the present version are also available on prep.ai.mit.edu
under names of the form diff-OO.OO-NN.NN in directory /u2/emacs .
These are made with diff -rc2.  Sometimes there are compressed
versions of these difference files as well; their names have .Z
appended.

The Emacs manual in source form is included in the distribution.
The dvi file produced by TeX is not included, but a copy may be
available for ftp under the name /u2/emacs/emacs.dvi.

** Copying Only Recently Changed Files

A special version of rcp exists which allows you, on an Internet host,
to copy all GNU Emacs files whose last-mod-dates don't match your
files.  See the file /u2/emacs/etc/RCP on prep.ai.mit.edu for
information on using it.

** Scheme and How To FTP It

The latest distribution version of C Scheme is in the directory
/u2/scheme/dist.  To obtain a "tarred" copy of this directory, telnet
to prep.ai.mit.edu and log in as scheme (password: scheme).  A file called
dist.tar will be created (if there isn't one already), and you will be
given a choice of the file transfer program to run (of all the ones
supported by PREP).  It should be self-explanatory (ha, ha! [try ? for
help]).

Read the files INSTALL and README in the top level C Scheme directory.

** GDB and how to FTP it.

GDB, the GNU source-level C debugger, is part of the Emacs distribution.
It can be found separately in the directory /u2/emacs/dist/gdb as
65 separate files.  If there is a demand, separate tar files of
GDB can be made available.

** Bison and how to FTP it.

Bison can be found in the directory /u2/emacs/bison, as 30 small to
medium size files.  It should be easy enough to FTP all of these
with the mget command.

** Alternative Internet FTP Sources

The administrators of simtel20.arpa also maintains copies of GNU
distributed software for MILNET/DDN hosts.  It is available via
anonymous ftp from PD:<UNIX.GNU> in the original tar format.

The administrators of louie.udel.edu also maintains copies of GNU
Emacs and the compress program.  The files are available via anonymous
ftp under directory ~ftp/gnu.  louie's addresses are (as of 21 Feb
1987):

10.0.0.96	louie udel-louie eecis3 udel-relay udel
192.5.39.3      louie.udel.edu udel-louie.arpa udel-louie louie udel-relay udel udel.edu

* Getting GNU Emacs via UUCP

OSU is distributing GNU Emacs via uucp.  Current details from Karl
Kleinpaste <..!cbosgd!osu-eddie!karl> or <karl@ohio-state.arap> or
<karl%ohio-state@csnet-relay.arpa>.

* If You Like The Software

If you like the software developed and distributed by the Free
Software Foundation, please express your satisfaction with a donation.
Your donations will help to support the Foundation and make our future
efforts successful, including a complete development and operating
system, called GNU (Gnu's Not Un*x), which will run Un*x user
programs.  For more information on GNU and the Foundation, contact us
at the above address.

Ordering a distribution tape from the Foundation is often a good
way to bring your company or university to make a donation.
