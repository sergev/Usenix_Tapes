	EMACS may stand for "Editing MACroS," but some friends of mine
suggested some more creative definitions. Here they are. Anyone have
any additions?

Someone at a luncheon suggested it meant:

Evenings,
Mornings,
And a 
Couple of
Saturdays

(In reference to the odd hours that went into the creation of my
implementation).

Pleeeeeeeze!!!  Nice try on the meaning of EMACS.  I believe the
correct acronym is:

Emacs 
Makes
All 
Computing 
Simple

Thank you, and Good Night

Many people have also seen FINE Is Not Emacs, but the one that has
character is THief Isn't Even Fine.
