/* 

   If first argument is "-", then a new environment is constructed
   from scratch; otherwise the environment is inherited from the parent
   process, except as modified by other options.
   
   So, "env - foo" will invoke the "foo" program in a null environment,
   whereas "env foo" would invoke "foo" in the same environment as that
   passed to "env" itself.

   Subsequent arguments are interpreted as follows:
   
   * "variable=value" (ie an arg containing a "=" character)
     means to set the specified environment variable to that value.
     `value' may be of zero length ("variable=").  Note that setting
     a variable to a zero-length value is different from unsetting it.

   * "-u variable" or "-unset variable"
     means to unset that variable
     If that variable isn't set, does nothing.

   * "-s variable value" or "-set variable value"
     same as "variable=value"

   * "-" or "--"
     are used to indicate that the following argument is the program
     to invoke.  This is only necessary when the program's name
     begins with "-" or contains a "="

   * anything else
     The first remaining argument specifies a program to invoke
     (it is searched for according to the specification of the PATH
     environment variable) and any arguments following that are
     passed as arguments to that program

     If no program-name is specified following the environment
     specifications the the resulting environment is printed
     (The is like specifying a program-name of "printenv")

   Examples:
     If the environment passed to "env" is
     { USER=rms EDITOR=emacs PATH=.:/gnubin:/hacks }

     * "env DISPLAY=gnu:0 nemacs"
        calls "nemacs" in the envionment
	{ EDITOR=emacs USER=rms DISPLAY=gnu }

     * "env - USER=foo /hacks/hack bar baz"
       will call the "hack" program on arguments "bar" and "baz"
       in an environment in which the only variable is "USER"
       Note that the "-" option will clear out the PATH variable,
       so one should be careful to specify in which directory
       to find the program to call
       
     * "env -u EDITOR USER=foo PATH=/energy -- e=mc2 bar baz"
       The program "/energy/e=mc2" is called with environment
       { USER=foo PATH=/energy }
