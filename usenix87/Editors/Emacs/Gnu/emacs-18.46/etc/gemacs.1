.SH DESCRIPTION
.I GNU Emacs
is a new version of 
.I Emacs,
written by the author of the original (PDP-10) 
.I Emacs,
Richard Stallman.  
Its user functionality encompasses
everything other 
.I Emacs 
editors do, and it is easily extensible since its
editing commands are written in Lisp.
.PP
.I gemacs
has an extensive interactive help facility,
but the facility assumes that you know how to manipulate
.I Emacs
windows and buffers.
CTRL-h (backspace
or CTRL-h) enters the Help facility.  Help Tutorial (CTRL-h t)
requests an interactive tutorial which can teach beginners the fundamentals
of 
.I Emacs 
in a few minutes.
Help Apropos (CTRL-h a) helps you
find a command given its functionality, Help Character (CTRL-h c)
describes a given character's effect, and Help Function (CTRL-h f)
describes a given Lisp function specified by name.
.PP
.I Emacs's
Undo can undo several steps of modification to your buffers, so it is
easy to recover from editing mistakes.
.PP
.I GNU Emacs's
many special packages handle mail reading (RMail) and sending (Mail),
outline editing (Outline), compiling (Compile), running subshells
within
.I Emacs
windows (Shell), running a Lisp read-eval-print loop
(Lisp-Interaction-Mode), and automated psychotherapy (Doctor).
.PP
There is an extensive reference manual, but
users of other Emacses
should have little trouble adapting even
without a copy.  Users new to
.I Emacs
will be able
to use basic features fairly rapidly by studying the tutorial and
using the self-documentation features.
.PP
.SM Emacs Options
.PP
The following options are of general interest:
.TP 8
.B file
Edit
.I file.
.TP
.B \+number
Go to the line specified by
.I number
(do not insert a space between the "+" sign and
the number).
.TP
.B \-d displayname
Create the 
.I Emacs
window on the display specified by 
.I displayname.
This must be the first argument listed in the command line.
.TP
.B \-q
Do not load an init file.
.TP
.B \-u user
Load
.I user's
init file.
.TP
.B \-t file
Use specified
.I file
as the terminal instead of using stdin/stdout.
This must be the first argument specified in the command line.
.PP
The following options are lisp-oriented
(these options are processed in the order encountered):
.TP 8
.B \-f function
Execute the lisp function
.I function.
.TP
.B \-l file
Load the lisp code in the file
.I file.
.PP
The following options are useful when running
.I Emacs
as a batch editor:
.TP 8
.B \-batch commandfile
Edit in batch mode using the commands found in
.I commandfile.
The editor will send messages to stdout.
This option must be the first in the argument list.
.TP
.B \-kill
Exit 
.I Emacs 
while in batch mode.
.PP
.I
.SM Using Emacs with X
.PP
.I Emacs
has been tailored to work well with the X window system.
To enable this feature, you must define the macro
.B HAVE_X_WINDOWS
in the file
.I src/config.h
before compiling
.I Emacs.
If you run
.I Emacs
from under X windows, it will create its own X window to
display in.  You will probably want to start the editor
as a background process
so that you can continue using your original window.
To use the optional X Menu features, define also the
macro
.B HAVE_X_MENU.
This macro is separate from
.B HAVE_X_WINDOWS
because the Menu facility of X does not work on all
the systems that support X.
.I Emacs
can be started with the following X switches:
.TP 8
.B \-r
Display the
.I Emacs
window in inverse video.
.TP
.B \-i
Use the "kitchen sink" bitmap icon when iconifying the
.I Emacs
window.
.TP
.B \-font font
Set the
.I Emacs
window's font to that specified by
.I font.
You will find the various
.I X
fonts in the
.I \/usr\/new\/lib\/X\/font
directory.
Note that
.I Emacs
will only accept fixed width fonts.
These include the
.I 6x10.onx, 6x13.onx, 6x13p.onx, 8x13.onx,
and
.I 9x15.onx
fonts.
The other fixed width fonts are specified by the
.I fx
character sequence that comes before the
.I .onx
extension.

When you specify a font,
do not include the
.I .onx
extension.
Be sure to put a space between the
.I \-font
switch and the font specification argument.
.TP
.B \-b pixels
Set the
.I Emacs
window's border width to the number of pixels specified by
.I pixels.
.TP
.B \-ib pixels
Set the window's internal border width to the number of pixels specified
by 
.I pixels.
Defaults to one pixel of padding on each side of the window.
.PP
.TP 8
.B \-w =[WIDTH][xHEIGHT][{+-}XOFF[{+-}YOFF]]
Set the
.I Emacs
window's width, height, and position on the screen.
The []'s denote optional arguments, the {}'s surround alternatives.
WIDTH and HEIGHT are in number of characters, XOFF and YOFF are in
pixels.  WIDTH defaults to 80, HEIGHT to 24, XOFF and YOFF to 1.  If you don't
give XOFF and/or YOFF, then you must use the mouse to create the window.
If you give XOFF and/or YOFF, then a WIDTHxHEIGHT window will
automatically be creating without intervention.  XOFF and YOFF specify deltas
from a corner of the screen to the corresponding corner of the window, as
follows:
.br
	
.br
\+XOFF+YOFF     upper left to upper left
.br
\-XOFF+YOFF     upper right to upper right
.br
\+XOFF-YOFF     lower left to lower left
.br
\-XOFF-YOFF     lower right to lower right
.PP
.TP 8
.B \-fg color
On color displays, sets the color of the text.
.TP
.B \-bg color
On color displays,
sets the color of the window's background.
See the file
.I \/usr\/lib\/rgb.txt
for a list of valid
.I color
names.
.TP
.B \-bd color
On color displays,
sets the color of the window's border.See the file
.I \/usr\/lib\/rgb.txt
for a list of valid
.I color
names.
.TP
.B \-cr color
On color displays,
sets the color of the window's text cursor.
See the file
.I \/usr\/lib\/rgb.txt
for a list of valid
.I color
names.
.TP
.B \-ms color
On color displays,
sets the color of the window's mouse cursor.
See the file
.I \/usr\/lib\/rgb.txt
for a list of valid
.I color
names.
.TP
.B \-d displayname
Create the
.I Emacs
window on the display specified by
.I displayname.
Must be the first option specified in the command line.
.B \-nw 
Tells
.I Emacs
not to use its special interface to X.  If you use this
switch when invoking
.I Emacs
from an
.I xterm
window, display is done in the
.I xterm
window.
This must be the first option specified in the command line.
.PP
You can set
.I X
default values for your
.I Emacs
windows in your
.I \.Xdefaults
file.
Use the following format:
.IP
emacs.keyword:value
.PP
where
.I value
specifies the default value of
.I keyword.
.I Emacs
lets you set default values for the following keywords:
.TP 8
.B BodyFont
Sets the window's text font.
.TP
.B ReverseVideo
If
.I ReverseVideo's
value is set to
.I on,
the window will be displayed in inverse video.
.TP
.B BitMapIcon
If
.I BitMapIcon's
value is set to
.I on,
the window will iconify into the "kitchen sink."
.TP
.B BorderWidth
Sets the window's border width in pixels.
.TP
.B Foreground
For color displays,
sets the window's text color.
See the file
.I \/usr\/lib\/rgb.txt
for a list of valid
.I color
names.
.TP
.B Background
For color displays,
sets the window's background color.
See the file
.I \/usr\/lib\/rgb.txt
for a list of valid
.I color
names.
.TP
.B Border
For color displays,
sets the color of the window's border.
See the file
.I \/usr\/lib\/rgb.txt
for a list of valid
.I color
names.
.TP
.B Cursor
For color displays,
sets the color of the window's text cursor.
See the file
.I \/usr\/lib\/rgb.txt
for a list of valid
.I color
names.
.TP
.B Mouse
For color displays,
sets the color of the window's mouse cursor.
See the file
.I \/usr\/lib\/rgb.txt
for a list of valid
.I color
names.
.PP
If you try to set color values while using a black and white display,
the window's characteristics will default as follows:
the foreground color will be set to black,
the background color will be set to white,
the border color will be set to grey,
and the text and mouse cursors will be set to black.

that define most editing commands.  Some are preloaded;
others are autoloaded from this directory when used.
  
/usr/local/emacs/man - sources for the Emacs reference manual.

/usr/local/emacs/etc - various programs that are used with
GNU Emacs, and some files of information.

/usr/local/emacs/etc/DOC.* - contains the documentation
strings for the Lisp primitives and preloaded Lisp functions
of GNU Emacs.  They are stored here to reduce the size of
Emacs proper.

/usr/local/emacs/etc/DIFF discusses GNU Emacs vs. Twenex Emacs;

These files also have information useful to anyone wishing to write
programs in the Emacs Lisp extension language, which has not yet been fully
documented.

/usr/local/emacs/info - files for the Info documentation browser
(a subsystem of Emacs) to refer to.  Currently not much of Unix
is documented here, but the complete text of the Emacs reference
manual is included in a convenient tree structured form.

/usr/local/emacs/lock - holds lock files that are made for all
files being modified in Emacs, to prevent simultaneous modification
of one file by two users.

/usr/local/emacs/cpp - the GNU cpp, needed for building Emacs on
certain versions of Unix where the standard cpp cannot handle long
names for macros.

/usr/local/emacs/shortnames - facilities for translating long names to
short names in C code, needed for building Emacs on certain versions
of Unix where the C compiler cannot handle long names for functions
or variables.

.SH BUGS
There is a mailing list, bug-gnu-emacs@prep.ai.mit.edu on the internet
(ucbvax!prep.ai.mit.edu!bug-gnu-emacs on UUCPnet), for reporting Emacs
bugs and fixes.  But before reporting something as a bug, please try
to be sure that it really is a bug, not a misunderstanding or a
deliberate feature.  We ask you to read the section ``Reporting Emacs
Bugs'' near the end of the reference manual (or Info system) for hints
on how and when to report bugs.  Also, include the version number of
the Emacs you are running in \fIevery\fR bug report that you send in.

Do not expect a personal answer to a bug report.  The purpose of reporting
bugs is to get them fixed for everyone in the next release, if possible.
For personal assistance, look in the SERVICE file (see above) for
a list of people who offer it.

Please do not send anything but bug reports to this mailing list.
Send requests to be added to mailing lists to the special list
info-gnu-emacs-request@prep.ai.mit.edu (or the corresponding UUCP
address).  For more information about Emacs mailing lists, see the
file /usr/local/emacs/etc/MAILINGLISTS.  Bugs tend actually to be
fixed if they can be isolated, so it is in your interest to report
them in such a way that they can be easily reproduced.
.PP
Bugs that I know about are: shell will not work with programs
running in Raw mode on some Unix versions.

.I Emacs 
to
anyone under the terms stated in the 
.I Emacs 
General Public License,
a copy of which accompanies each copy of 
.I Emacs 
and which also
appears in the reference manual.
.PP
Copies of
.I Emacs
may sometimes be received packaged with distributions of Unix systems,
but it is never included in the scope of any license covering those
systems.  Such inclusion violates the terms on which distribution
is permitted.  In fact, the primary purpose of the General Public
License is to prohibit anyone from attaching any other restrictions
to redistribution of 
.I Emacs.
.PP
Richard Stallman encourages you to improve and extend 
.I Emacs, 
and urges that
you contribute your extensions to the GNU library.  Eventually GNU
(Gnu's Not Unix) will be a complete replacement for Berkeley
Unix.
Everyone will be able to use the GNU system for free.
