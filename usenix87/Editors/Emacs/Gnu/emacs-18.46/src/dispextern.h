/* Display line structure.
This structure records the contents of a line
either as already on the display
or as we desire to have it on the display.

PhysScreen is a vector of pointers to lines
 describing the actual contents of the screen.
DesiredScreen is a vector of pointers to lines
 describing what we want to put on the screen.
 These were made from the buffers being displayed
 by the file window.c

The code in this file compares those two vectors of display lines
 and performs the updating.

As display lines are used only to go in those vectors,
 the most display lines that ever ought to exist is
 twice the maximum screen size.  That many are created
 initially and put in a pool.  If the pool is ever empty
 and a line is needed, that indicates a bug.
