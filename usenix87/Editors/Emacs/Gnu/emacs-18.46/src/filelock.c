/* lock_file locks file fn,
   meaning it serves notice on the world that you intend to edit that file.
   This should be done only when about to modify a file-visiting
   buffer previously unmodified.
   Do not (normally) call lock_buffer for a buffer already modified,
   as either the file is already locked, or the user has already
   decided to go ahead without locking.

   When lock_buffer returns, either the lock is locked for us,
   or the user has said to go ahead without locking.

   If the file is locked by someone else, lock_buffer calls
   ask-user-about-lock (a Lisp function) with two arguments,
   the file name and the name of the user who did the locking.
   This function can signal an error, or return t meaning
   take away the lock, or return nil meaning ignore the lock.  */
