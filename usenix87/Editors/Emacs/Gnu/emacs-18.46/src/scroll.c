/* Calculate the insert and delete line costs.

   We keep the ID costs in a precomputed array based on the position
   at which the I or D is performed.  Also, there are two kinds of ID
   costs: the "once-only" and the "repeated".  This is to handle both
   those terminals that are able to insert N lines at a time (once-
   only) and those that must repeatedly insert one line.

   The cost to insert N lines at line L is
   	    [tt.t_ILov  + (screen_height + 1 - L) * tt.t_ILpf] +
	N * [tt.t_ILnov + (screen_height + 1 - L) * tt.t_ILnpf]

   ILov represents the basic insert line overhead.  ILpf is the padding
   required to allow the terminal time to move a line: insertion at line
   L changes (screen_height + 1 - L) lines.

   The first bracketed expression above is the overhead; the second is
   the multiply factor.  Both are dependent only on the position at
   which the insert is performed.  We store the overhead in ILcost and
   the multiply factor in ILncost.  Note however that any insertion
   must include at least one multiply factor.  Rather than compute this
   as ILcost[line]+ILncost[line], we add ILncost into ILcost.  This is
   reasonable because of the particular algorithm used in calcM.

   Deletion is essentially the same as insertion.
