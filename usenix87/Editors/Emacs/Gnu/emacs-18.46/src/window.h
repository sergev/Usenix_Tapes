/* Windows are allocated as if they were vectors, but then the
Lisp data type is changed to Lisp_Window.  They are garbage
collected along with the vectors.

All windows in use are arranged into a tree, with pointers up and down.

Windows that are leaves of the tree are actually displayed
and show the contents of buffers.  Windows that are not leaves
are used for representing the way groups of leaf windows are
arranged on the screen.  Leaf windows never become non-leaves.
They are deleted only by calling delete-window on them (but
this can be done implicitly).  Combination windows can be created
and deleted at any time.

A leaf window has a non-nil buffer field, and also
 has markers in its start and pointm fields.  Non-leaf windows
 have nil in these fields.

Non-leaf windows are either vertical or horizontal combinations.

A vertical combination window has children that are arranged
one above the next.  Its vchild field points to the uppermost child.
The parent field of each of the children points to the vertical
combination window.  The next field of each child points to the
child below it, or is nil for the lowest child.  The prev field
or each child points to the child above it, or is nil for the highest child.

A horizontal combination window has children that are side by side.
Its hchild field points to the leftmost child.  In each child
the next field points to the child to the right and the prev field
points to the child to the left.

The children of a vertical combination window may be leaf windows
or horizontal combination windows.  The children of a horizontal
combination window may be leaf windows or vertical combination windows.

At the top of the tree are two windows which have nil as parent.
The second of these is minibuf_window.  The first one manages all
the screen area that is not minibuffer, and is called the root window.
Different windows can be the root at different times;
initially the root window is a leaf window, but if more windows
are created then that leaf window ceases to be root and a newly
made combination window becomes root instead.

In any case, prev of the minibuf window is the root window and
next of the root window is the minibuf window.  To find the
root window at any time, do XWINDOW (minibuf_window)->prev.
