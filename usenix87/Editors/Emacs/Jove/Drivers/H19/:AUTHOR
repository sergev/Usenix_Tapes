In response to my problems in bringing up a dedicated driver for JOVE
(Jonathan's Own Version of Emacs), I got this response from Ken Mitchum
who asked me to post this because he is cut off from USENET temporarily.

Subject: h19 driver
Status: R

Sorry I did not update the h19 driver demo to reflect some other changes
in the code. I am enclosing an updated version which works on our system.
Since I am cut off from usenet right now, could you post this driver to
the net and tell them that "jove.5.tar" has been updated with the
correct version. I don't know how long it will be before we are back on
the net.

Changes made were:

	putp()		added to code (a kludge)
	topos()		adjusted arguments - home used to be 1,1 now is 0,0.
	Trm()		function must return number of lines on screen.
	Trm()		function must do software screen reset itself.
