Alphabetical List of Commands and Variables
.dc "prefix-1" "Escape"
This reads the next character and runs a command based on the character
typed.  If you wait for more than a second or so before typing the next
character, the message "ESC" will be printed on the message line to
remind you that \s-2JOVE\s0 is waiting for another character.
.dc "prefix-2" "C-X"
This reads the next character and runs a command based on the character
typed.  If you wait for more than a second or so before typing another
character, the message "C-X" will be printed on the message line to
remind you that \s-2JOVE\s0 is waiting for another character.
.dc "prefix-3" "Not Bound"
This reads the next character and runs a command based on the character
typed.  If you wait for more than a second or so before typing the next
character, the character that invoked Prefix-3 will be printed on the
message line to remind you that \s-2JOVE\s0 is waiting for another one.
.dc "allow-^S-and-^Q" "(variable)"
This variable, when set, tells \s-2JOVE\s0 that your terminal does not need
to use the characters C-S and C-Q for flow control, and that it is
okay to bind things to them.  This variable should be set depending
upon what kind of terminal you have.
.dc "allow-bad-filenames" "(variable)"
If set, this variable permits filenames to contain "bad" characters
such as those from the set *&%!"`[]{}.  These files are harder to deal
with, because the characters mean something to the shell.  The default
value is "off".
.dc "append-region" "Not Bound"
This appends the region to a specified file.  If the file does not
already exist it is created.
.dc "apropos" "Not Bound"
This types out all the commands, variables and macros with the specific
keyword in their names.  For each command and macro that contains the
string, the key sequence that can be used to execute the command or macro is
printed; with variables, the current value is printed.  So, to find all the
commands that are related to windows, you type
.DS
ESC X apropos window<Return>
.DE
.dc "auto-case-abbrev" "(variable)"
When this variable is on (the default), word abbreviations are adjusted for
case automatically.  For example, if "jove" were the abbreviation for
"jonathan's own version of emacs", then typing "jove" would give you
"jonathan's own version of emacs", typing "Jove" would give you "Jonathan's
own version of emacs", and typing "JOVE" would give you "Jonathan's Own
Version of Emacs".  When this variable is "off", upper and lower case are
distinguished when looking for the abbreviation, i.e., in the example above,
"JOVE" and "Jove" would not be expanded unless they were defined separately.
.dc "auto-execute-command" "Not Bound"
This tells \s-2JOVE\s0 to execute a command automatically when a file whose
name matches a specified pattern is visited.  The first argument is the
command you want executed and the second is a regular expression
pattern that specifies the files that apply.  For example, if you want
to be in show-match-mode when you edit C source files (that is, files
that end with ".c" or ".h") you can type
.ID
ESC X auto-execute-command show-match-mode .*\.[ch]$
.DE
.dc "auto-execute-macro" "Not Bound"
This is like
.IQ auto-execute-command
except you use it to execute macros
automatically instead of built-in commands.
.dc "auto-fill-mode" "Not Bound"
This turns on Auto Fill mode (or off if it's currently on) in the
selected buffer.  When \s-2JOVE\s0 is in Auto Fill mode it automatically
breaks lines for you when you reach the right margin so you don't have
to remember to hit Return.  \s-2JOVE\s0 uses 78 as the right margin but you
can change that by setting the variable
.IQ right-margin
to another
value.  See the
.IQ set
command to learn how to do this.
.dc "auto-indent-mode" "Not Bound"
This turns on Auto Indent mode (or off if it's currently on) in the
selected buffer.  When \s-2JOVE\s0 is in Auto Indent mode, Return indents the
new line to the same position as the line you were just on.  This is
useful for lining up C code (or any other language (but what else is
there besides C?)).  This is out of date because of the new command
called
.IQ newline-and-indent
but it remains because of several
"requests" on the part of, uh, enthusiastic and excitable users, that
it be left as it is.
.dc "backward-character" "C-B"
This moves point backward over a single character.  If point is at the
beginning of the line it moves to the end of the previous line.
.dc "backward-paragraph" "ESC ["
This moves point backward to the beginning of the current or previous
paragraph.  Paragraphs are bounded by lines that begin with a Period or
Tab, or by blank lines; a change in indentation may also signal a break
between paragraphs, except that \s-2JOVE\s0 allows the first line of a paragraph
to be indented differently from the other lines.
.dc "backward-s-expression" "ESC C-B"
This moves point backward over a s-expression.  It is just like
.IQ forward-s-expression
with a negative argument.
.dc "backward-sentence" "ESC A"
This moves point backward to the beginning of the current or previous
sentence.  \s-2JOVE\s0 considers the end of a sentence to be the characters
".", "!" or "?" followed by a Return or by one or more spaces.
.dc "backward-word" "ESC B"
This moves point backward to the beginning of the current or previous
word.
.dc "bad-filename-extensions" "(variable)"
This contains a list of words separated by spaces which are to be
considered bad filename extensions, and so will not be counted in
filename completion.  The default is ".o" so if you have jove.c and
jove.o in the same directory, the filename completion will not complain
of an ambiguity because it will ignore jove.o.
.dc "beginning-of-file" "ESC <"
This moves point backward to the beginning of the buffer.  This sometimes
prints the "Point Pushed" message.  If the top of the buffer isn't on the
screen \s-2JOVE\s0 will set the mark so you can go back to where you were
if you want.
.dc "beginning-of-line" "C-A"
This moves point to the beginning of the current line.
.dc "beginning-of-window" "ESC ,"
This moves point to the beginning of the current window.  The sequence
"ESC ," is the same as "ESC <" (beginning of file) except without the shift
key on the "<", and can thus can easily be remembered.
.dc "bind-to-key" "Not Bound"
This attaches a key to an internal \s-2JOVE\s0 command so that future hits on
that key invoke that command.  For example, to make "C-W" erase the
previous word, you type "ESC X bind-to-key kill-previous-word C-W".
.dc "bind-macro-to-key" "Not Bound"
This is like
.IQ bind-to-key
except you use it to attach keys to
named macros.
.dc "bind-macro-to-word-abbrev" "Not Bound"
This command allows you to bind a macro to a previously defined word
abbreviation.  Whenever you type the abbreviation, it will first be expanded
as an abbreviation, and then the macro will be executed.  Note that if the
macro moves around, you should set the mark first (C-@) and then exchange
the point and mark last (C-X C-X).
.dc "buffer-position" "Not Bound"
This displays the current file name, current line number, total number
of lines, percentage of the way through the file, and the position of
the cursor in the current line.
.dc "c-mode" "Not Bound"
This turns on C mode in the currently selected buffer.  This is one of
currently four possible major modes:  Fundamental, Text, C, Lisp.
When in C or Lisp mode, Tab, "}", and ")" behave a little differently
from usual: They are indented to the "right" place for C (or Lisp)
programs.  In \s-2JOVE\s0, the "right" place is simply the way the author
likes it (but I've got good taste).
.dc "case-character-capitalize" "Not Bound"
This capitalizes the character after point, i.e., the character undo
the cursor.  If a negative argument is supplied that many characters
.IQ before
point are upper cased.
.dc "case-ignore-search" "(variable)"
This variable, when set, tells \s-2JOVE\s0 to treat upper and lower case as
the same when searching.  Thus "jove" and "JOVE" would match, and
"JoVe" would match either.  The default value of this variable is "off".
.dc "case-region-lower" "Not Bound"
This changes all the upper case letters in the region to their lower
case equivalent.
.dc "case-region-upper" "Not Bound"
This changes all the lower case letters in the region to their upper
case equivalent.
.dc "case-word-capitalize" "ESC C"
This capitalizes the current word by making the current letter upper
case and making the rest of the word lower case.  Point is moved to
the end of the word.  If point is not positioned on a word it is first
moved forward to the beginning of the next word.  If a negative
argument is supplied that many words
.IQ before
point are capitalized.
This is useful for correcting the word just typed without having to
move point to the beginning of the word yourself.
.dc "case-word-lower" "ESC L"
This lower-cases the current word and leaves point at the end of it.
If point is in the middle of a word the rest of the word is
converted.  If point is not in a word it is first moved forward to the
beginning of the next word.  If a negative argument is supplied that
many words
.IQ before
point are converted to lower case.  This is useful
for correcting the word just typed without having to move point to the
beginning of the word yourself.
.dc "case-word-upper" "ESC U"
This upper-cases the current word and leaves point at the end of it.
If point is in the middle of a word the rest of the word is
converted.  If point is not in a word it is first moved forward to the
beginning of the next word.  If a negative argument is supplied that
many words
.IQ before
point are converted to upper case.  This is useful
for correcting the word just typed without having to move point to the
beginning of the word yourself.
.dc "character-to-octal-insert" "Not Bound"
This inserts a Back-slash followed by the ascii value of the next
character typed.  For example, "C-G" inserts the string "\\007".
.dc "cd" "Not Bound"
This changes the current directory.
.dc "clear-and-redraw" "ESC C-L"
This clears the entire screen and redraws all the windows.  Use this
when \s-2JOVE\s0 gets confused about what's on the screen, or when the screen
gets filled with garbage characters or output from another program.
.dc "comment-format" "(variable)"
This variable tells \s-2JOVE\s0 how to format your comments when you run the
command
.IQ fill-comment.
Its format is this:
.ID
<open pattern>%!<line header>%c<line trailer>%!<close pattern>
.DE
The %!, %c, and %! must appear in the format; everything else is optional.
A newline (represented by %n) may appear in the open or close patterns.  %%
is the representation for %.  The default comment format is for C comments.
See
.IQ fill-comment
for more.
.dc "compile-it" "C-X C-E"
This compiles your program by running the UNIX command "make" into a buffer,
and automatically parsing the error messages that are created (if any).  See
the
.IQ parse-errors
and
.IQ parse-special-errors
commands.  To compile
a C program without "make", use "C-U C-X C-E" and \s-2JOVE\s0 will prompt
for a command to run instead of make.  (And then the command you type will
become the default command.)  You can use this to parse the output from the
C compiler or the "grep" or "lint" programs.
.dc "continue-process" "Not Bound"
This sends SIGCONT to the current interactive process,
.IQ if
the process
is currently stopped.
.dc "copy-region" "ESC W"
This takes all the text in the region and copies it onto the kill ring
buffer.  This is just like running
.IQ kill-region
followed by the
.IQ yank
command.  See the
.IQ kill-region
and
.IQ yank
commands.
.dc "current-error" "Not Bound"
This moves to the current error in the list of parsed errors.  See the
.IQ next-error
and
.IQ previous-error
commands for more detailed
information.
.dc "date" "Not Bound"
This prints the date on the message line.
.dc "define-mode-word-abbrev" "Not Bound"
This defines a mode-specific abbreviation.
.dc "define-global-word-abbrev" "Not Bound"
This defines a global abbreviation.
.dc "delete-blank-lines" "C-X C-O"
This deletes all the blank lines around point.  This is useful when you
previously opened many lines with "C-O" and now wish to delete the
unused ones.
.dc "delete-buffer" "C-X K"
This deletes a buffer and frees up all the memory associated with it.
Be careful!  Once a buffer has been deleted it is gone forever.  \s-2JOVE\s0
will ask you to confirm if you try to delete a buffer that needs
saving.  This command is useful for when \s-2JOVE\s0 runs out of space to
store new buffers.
.dc "delete-macro" "Not Bound"
This deletes a macro from the list of named macros.  It is an error to
delete the keyboard-macro.  Once the macro is deleted it is gone forever.
If you are about to save macros to a file and decide you don't want to save
a particular one, delete it.
.dc "delete-next-character" "C-D"
This deletes the character that's just after point (that is, the
character under the cursor).  If point is at the end of a line, the
line separator is deleted and the next line is joined with the current
one.
.dc "delete-other-windows" "C-X 1"
This deletes all the other windows except the current one.  This can be
thought of as going back into One Window mode.
.dc "delete-previous-character" "Rubout"
This deletes the character that's just before point (that is, the
character before the cursor).  If point is at the beginning of the
line, the line separator is deleted and that line is joined with the
previous one.
.dc "delete-white-space" "ESC \\\\"
This deletes all the Tabs and Spaces around point.
.dc "delete-current-window" "C-X D"
This deletes the current window and moves point into one of the
remaining ones.  It is an error to try to delete the only remaining
window.
.dc "describe-bindings" "Not Bound"
This types out a list containing each bound key and the command that gets
invoked every time that key is typed.  To make a wall chart of \s-2JOVE\s0
commands, set
.IQ send-typeout-to-buffer
to "on" and \s-2JOVE\s0 will
store the key bindings in a buffer which you can save to a file and then
print.
.dc "describe-command" "Not Bound"
This prints some info on a specified command.
.dc "describe-key" "Not Bound"
This waits for you to type a key and then tells the name of the
command that gets invoked every time that key is hit.  Once you have
the name of the command you can use the
.IQ describe-command
command
to find out exactly what it does.
.dc "describe-variable" "Not Bound"
This prints some info on a specified variable.
.dc "digit" "ESC [0-9]"
This reads a numeric argument.  When you type "ESC" followed by a
number, "digit" keeps reading numbers until you type some other
command.  Then that command is executes with the numeric argument you
specified.
.dc "digit-1" "Not Bound"
This pretends you typed "ESC 1".  This is useful for terminals that
have keypads that send special sequences for numbers typed on the
keypad as opposed to numbers typed from the keyboard.  This can save
having type "ESC" when you want to specify an argument.
.dc "digit-2" "Not Bound"
This pretends you typed "ESC 2".  This is useful for terminals that
have keypads that send special sequences for numbers typed on the
keypad as opposed to numbers typed from the keyboard.  This can save
having type "ESC" when you want to specify an argument.
.dc "digit-3" "Not Bound"
This pretends you typed "ESC 3".  This is useful for terminals that
have keypads that send special sequences for numbers typed on the
keypad as opposed to numbers typed from the keyboard.  This can save
having type "ESC" when you want to specify an argument.
.dc "digit-4" "Not Bound"
This pretends you typed "ESC 4".  This is useful for terminals that
have keypads that send special sequences for numbers typed on the
keypad as opposed to numbers typed from the keyboard.  This can save
having type "ESC" when you want to specify an argument.
.dc "digit-5" "Not Bound"
This pretends you typed "ESC 5".  This is useful for terminals that
have keypads that send special sequences for numbers typed on the
keypad as opposed to numbers typed from the keyboard.  This can save
having type "ESC" when you want to specify an argument.
.dc "digit-6" "Not Bound"
This pretends you typed "ESC 6".  This is useful for terminals that
have keypads that send special sequences for numbers typed on the
keypad as opposed to numbers typed from the keyboard.  This can save
having type "ESC" when you want to specify an argument.
.dc "digit-7" "Not Bound"
This pretends you typed "ESC 7".  This is useful for terminals that
have keypads that send special sequences for numbers typed on the
keypad as opposed to numbers typed from the keyboard.  This can save
having type "ESC" when you want to specify an argument.
.dc "digit-8" "Not Bound"
This pretends you typed "ESC 8".  This is useful for terminals that
have keypads that send special sequences for numbers typed on the
keypad as opposed to numbers typed from the keyboard.  This can save
having type "ESC" when you want to specify an argument.
.dc "digit-9" "Not Bound"
This pretends you typed "ESC 9".  This is useful for terminals that
have keypads that send special sequences for numbers typed on the
keypad as opposed to numbers typed from the keyboard.  This can save
having type "ESC" when you want to specify an argument.
.dc "digit-0" "Not Bound"
This pretends you typed "ESC 0".  This is useful for terminals that
have keypads that send special sequences for numbers typed on the
keypad as opposed to numbers typed from the keyboard.  This can save
having type "ESC" when you want to specify an argument.
.dc "dirs" "Not Bound"
This prints out the directory stack.  See the "cd", "pushd", "popd"
commands for more info.
.dc "disable-biff" "(variable)"
When this is set, \s-2JOVE\s0 disables biff when you're editing and enables it
again when you get out of \s-2JOVE\s0, or when you pause to the parent shell
or push to a new shell. (This means arrival of new mail will not be
immediately apparent but will not cause indiscriminate writing on the
display). The default is "off".
.dc "dstop-process" "Not Bound"
Send the "dsusp" character to the current process.  This is the
character that suspends a process on the next read from the
terminal.  Most people have it set to C-Y.  This only works if
you have the interactive process feature, and if you are in a
buffer bound to a process.
.dc "edit-word-abbrevs" "Not Bound"
This creates a buffer with a list of each abbreviation and the phrase
it expands into, and enters a recursive edit to let you change the
abbreviations or add some more.  The format of this list is
"abbreviation:phrase" so if you add some more you should follow that
format.  It's probably simplest just to copy some already existing
abbreviations and edit them.  When you are done you type "C-X C-C" to
exit the recursive edit.
.dc "end-of-file" "ESC >"
This moves point forward to the end of the buffer.  This sometimes
prints the "Point Pushed" message.  If the end of the buffer isn't on
the screen \s-2JOVE\s0 will set the mark so you can go back to where you were
if you want.
.dc "end-of-line" "C-E"
This moves point to the end of the current line.  If the line is too
long to fit on the screen \s-2JOVE\s0 will scroll the line to the left to
make the end of the line visible.  The line will slide back to its
normal position when you move backward past the leftmost visible character
or when you move off the line altogether.
.dc "end-of-window" "ESC ."
This moves point to the last character in the window.
.dc "eof-process" "Not Bound"
Sends EOF to the current interactive process.  This only works on
versions of \s-2JOVE\s0 which run under 4.2-3 BSD VAX UNIX.  You can't send
EOF to processes on the 2.9 BSD PDP-11 UNIX.
.dc "erase-buffer" "Not Bound"
This erases the contents of the specified buffer.  This is like
.IQ delete-buffer
except it only erases the contents of the buffer, not
the buffer itself.  If you try to erase a buffer that needs saving you
will be asked to confirm it.
.dc "error-window-size" "(variable)"
This is the percentage of the screen to use for the error-window on the
screen.  When you execute
.IQ compile-it,
.IQ error-window-size
percent of the screen will go to the error window.  If the window already
exists and is a different size, it is made to be this size.  The default
value is 20%.
.dc "exchange-point-and-mark" "C-X C-X"
This moves point to mark and makes mark the old point.  This is for
quickly moving from one end of the region to another.
.dc "execute-named-command" "ESC X"
This is the way to execute a command that isn't bound to any key.
When you are prompted with ": " you can type the name of the
command.  You don't have to type the entire name.  Once the command
is unambiguous you can type Space and \s-2JOVE\s0 will fill in the rest for
you.
If you are not sure of the name of the command, type "?" and \s-2JOVE\s0
will print a list of all the commands that you could possibly match
given what you've already typed.  If you don't have any idea what the
command's name is but you know it has something to do with windows
(for example), you can do "ESC X apropos window" and \s-2JOVE\s0 will print a
list of all the commands that are related to windows.
If you find yourself constantly executing the same commands this way
you probably want to bind them to keys so that you can execute them
more quickly.  See the
.IQ bind-to-key
command.
.dc "execute-keyboard-macro" "C-X E"
This executes the keyboard macro.  If you supply a numeric argument the
macro is executed that many times.
.dc "execute-macro" "Not Bound"
This executes a specified macro.  If you supply a numeric argument the
macro is executed that many times.
.dc "exit-jove" "C-X C-C"
This exits \s-2JOVE\s0.  If any buffers need saving \s-2JOVE\s0 will print a warning
message and ask for confirmation.  If you leave without saving your
buffers all your work will be lost.  If you made a mistake and really
do want to exit then you can.  If you are in a recursive editing level
.IQ exit-jove
will return you from that.
.dc "file-creation-mode" "(variable)"
This variable has an octal value.
It contains the mode (see
.IQ chmod(1)
) with which files should be created.  This mode gets modified by your
current umask setting (see
.IQ umask(1)
).  The default value is usually
.IQ 0666
or
.IQ 0644.
.dc "files-should-end-with-newline" "(variable)"
This variable indicates that all files should always have a newline
at the end.  This is often necessary for line printers and the like.
When set, if \s-2JOVE\s0 is writing a file whose last character is not a
newline, it will add one automatically.
.dc "fill-comment" "Not Bound"
This command fills in your C comments to make them pretty and readable.
This filling is done according the variable
.IQ comment-format.
.DS L
/*
 * the default format makes comments like this.
 */
.DE
This can be changed by changing the format variable.  Other languages
may be supported by changing the format variable appropriately.  The
formatter looks backwards from dot for an open comment symbol.  If 
found, all indentation is done relative the position of the first character
of the open symbol.  If there is a matching close symbol, the entire 
comment is formatted.  If not, the region between dot and the open symbol
is reformatted.
.dc "fill-paragraph" "ESC J"
This rearranges words between lines so that all the lines in the current
paragraph extend as close to the right margin as possible, ensuring that
none of the lines will be greater than the right margin.  The default value
for
.IQ right-margin
is 78, but can be changed with the
.IQ set
and
.IQ right-margin-here
commands.  \s-2JOVE\s0 has a complicated algorithm
for determining the beginning and end of the paragraph.  In the normal case
\s-2JOVE\s0 will give all the lines the same indent as they currently have,
but if you wish to force a new indent you can supply a numeric argument to
.IQ fill-paragraph
(e.g., by typing C-U ESC J)
and \s-2JOVE\s0 will indent each line to the column
specified by the
.IQ left-margin
variable.  See also the
.IQ left-margin
variable and
.IQ left-margin-here
command.
.dc "fill-region" "Not Bound"
This is like
.IQ fill-paragraph,
except it operates on a region instead of
just a paragraph.
.dc "filter-region" "Not Bound"
This sends the text in the region to a UNIX command, and replaces the
region with the output from that command.  For example, if you are
lazy and don't like to take the time to write properly indented C
code, you can put the region around your C file and
.IQ filter-region
it
through
.IQ cb,
the UNIX C beautifier.  If you have a file that contains
a bunch of lines that need to be sorted you can do that from inside
\s-2JOVE\s0 too, by filtering the region through the
.IQ sort
UNIX command.
Before output from the command replaces the region \s-2JOVE\s0 stores the old
text in the kill ring, so if you are unhappy with the results you can
easily get back the old text with "C-Y".
.dc "find-file" "C-X C-F"
This visits a file into its own buffer and then selects that buffer.
If you've already visited this file in another buffer, that buffer is
selected.  If the file doesn't yet exist, \s-2JOVE\s0 will print "(New file)"
so that you know.
.dc "find-tag" "C-X T"
This finds the file that contains the specified tag.  \s-2JOVE\s0 looks up
tags by default in the "tags" file in the current directory.  You can change
the default tag name by setting the
.IQ tag-file
variable to another
name.  If you specify a numeric argument to this command, you will be
prompted for a tag file.  This is a good way to specify another tag file
without changing the default.  If the tag cannot be found the error is
reported and point stays where it is.
.dc "find-tag-at-point" "Not Bound"
This finds the file that contains the tag that point is currently on.
See
.IQ find-tag.
.dc "first-non-blank" "ESC M"
This moves point back to the indent of the current line.
.dc "forward-character" "C-F"
This moves forward over a single character.  If point is at the end of
the line it moves to the beginning of the next one.
.dc "forward-paragraph" "ESC ]"
This moves point forward to the end of the current or next paragraph.
Paragraphs are bounded by lines that begin with a Period or Tab, or by blank
lines; a change in indentation may also signal a break between paragraphs,
except that \s-2JOVE\s0 allows the first line of a paragraph to be indented
differently from the other lines.
.dc "forward-s-expression" "ESC C-F"
This moves point forward over a s-expression.  If the first significant
character after point is "(", this moves past the matching ")".  If the
character begins an identifier, this moves just past it.  This is mode
dependent, so this will move over atoms in LISP mode and C identifiers in C
mode.  \s-2JOVE\s0 also matches "{".
.dc "forward-sentence" "ESC E"
This moves point forward to the end of the current or next sentence.
\s-2JOVE\s0 considers the end of a sentence to be the characters ".", "!" or
"?" followed by a Return, or one or more spaces.
.dc "forward-word" "ESC F"
This moves point forward to the end of the current or next word.
.dc "fundamental-mode" "Not Bound"
This sets the major mode to Fundamental.  This affects what \s-2JOVE\s0
considers as characters that make up words.  For instance,
Single-quote is not part of a word in Fundamental mode, but is in Text
mode.
.dc "goto-line" "ESC G"
If a numeric argument is supplied point moves to the beginning of that
line.  If no argument is supplied, point remains where it is.  This is
so you don't lose your place unintentionally, by accidentally hitting
the "G" instead of "F".
.dc "grind-s-expr" "Not Bound"
When point is positioned on a "(", this re-indents that LISP expression.
.dc "grow-window" "C-X ^"
This makes the current window one line bigger.  This only works when
there is more than one window and provided there is room to change the
size.
.dc "paren-flash" ") } ]"
This handles the C mode curly brace indentation, the Lisp mode paren
indentation, and the Show Match mode paren/curly brace/square bracket
flashing.
.dc "handle-tab" "Tab"
This handles indenting to the "right" place in C and Lisp mode, and
just inserts itself in Text mode.
.dc "i-search-forward" "Not Bound"
Incremental search.  Like search-forward except that instead of prompting
for a string and searching for that string all at once, it accepts the string
one character at a time.  After each character you type as part of the search
string, it searches for the entire string so far.  When you like what it
found, type the Return key to finish the search.  You can take back a
character with Rubout and the search will back up to the position before
that character was typed.  C-G aborts the search.
.dc "i-search-reverse" "Not Bound"
Incremental search.  Like search-reverse except that instead of prompting
for a string and searching for that string all at once, it accepts the string
one character at a time.  After each character you type as part of the search
string, it searches for the entire string so far.  When you like what it
found, type the Return key to finish the search.  You can take back a
character with Rubout and the search will back up to the position before
that character was typed.  C-G aborts the search.
.dc "insert-file" "C-X C-I"
This inserts a specified file into the current buffer at point.  Point
is positioned at the beginning of the inserted file.
.dc "internal-tabstop" "(variable)"
The number of spaces \s-2JOVE\s0 should print when it displays a tab character.
The default value is 8.
.dc "interrupt-character" "(variable)"
This is set to the character that interrupts JOVE (with a signal) no matter
what JOVE is doing.  It's main use is for interrupting non-interactive
processes, but it also has uses for debugging.  Unfortunately there is no
way to turn off the interrupt character.
.dc "interrupt-process" "Not Bound"
This sends the interrupt character (usually C-C) to the interactive process
in the current buffer.  This is only for versions of \s-2JOVE\s0 that have the
interactive processes feature.  This only works when you are inside a buffer
that's attached to a process.
.dc "shell" "Not Bound"
This starts up an interactive shell in a window.  \s-2JOVE\s0 uses
"*shell*" as the name of the buffer in which the interacting takes
place.  See the manual for information on how to use interactive
processes.
.dc "i-shell-command" "Not Bound"
This is like
.IQ shell-command
except it lets you continue with your
editing while the command is running.  This is really useful for long
running commands with sporadic output.  See the manual for information
on how to use interactive processes.
.dc "kill-next-word" "ESC D"
This kills the text from point to the end of the current or next word.
.dc "kill-previous-word" "ESC Rubout"
This kills the text from point to the beginning of the current or
previous word.
.dc "kill-process" "Not Bound"
This command prompts for a buffer name or buffer number (just as
select-buffer does) and then sends the process in that buffer a
kill signal (9).
.dc "kill-region" "C-W"
This deletes the text in the region and saves it on the kill ring.
Commands that delete text but save it on the kill ring all have the
word "kill" in their names.  Type "C-Y" to yank back the most recent
kill.
.dc "kill-s-expression" "ESC C-K"
This kills the text from point to the end of the current or next
s-expression.
.dc "kill-some-buffers" "Not Bound"
This goes through all the existing buffers and asks whether or not to kill
them.  If you decide to kill a buffer, and it turns out that the buffer is
modified, \s-2JOVE\s0 will offer to save it first.  This is useful for when \s-2JOVE\s0
runs out of memory to store lines (this only happens on PDP-11's) and you
have lots of buffers that you are no longer using.
.dc "kill-to-beginning-of-sentence" "C-X Rubout"
This kills from point to the beginning of the current or previous
sentence.
.dc "kill-to-end-of-line" "C-K"
This kills from point to the end of the current line.  When point is
at the end of the line the line separator is deleted and the next line
is joined with current one.  If a numeric argument is supplied that
many lines are killed; if the argument is negative that many lines
.IQ before
point are killed; if the argument is zero the text from point
to the beginning of the line is killed.
.dc "kill-to-end-of-sentence" "ESC K"
This kills from point to the end of the current or next sentence.  If a
negative numeric argument is supplied it kills from point to the
beginning of the current or previous sentence.
.dc "left-margin" "(variable)"
This is how far lines should be indented when auto-indent mode is on,
or when the
.IQ newline-and-indent
command is run (usually by typing
LineFeed).  It is also used by fill-paragraph and auto-fill mode.
If the value is zero (the default) then the left margin is determined
from the surrounding lines.
.dc "left-margin-here" "Not Bound"
This sets the
.IQ left-margin
variable to the current position of
point.  This is an easy way to say, "Make the left margin begin here,"
without having to count the number of spaces over it actually is.
.dc "lisp-mode" "Not Bound"
This turns on Lisp mode.  Lisp mode is one of four mutually exclusive major
modes: Fundamental, Text, C, and Lisp.  In Lisp mode, the characters Tab
and ) are treated specially, similar to the way they are treated in C mode.
Also, Auto Indent mode is affected, and handled specially.
