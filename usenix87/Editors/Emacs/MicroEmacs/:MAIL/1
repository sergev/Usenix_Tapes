Here is the documentation for the PD microemacs:  The second set of key
bindings are due to the people at Case Western Reserve University.  I have
forgotten, for the moment, where this microemacs originated.

These are the key bindings, as they are in the 

	ue.tos version of 01/18/86.

To change these bindings, recompile 'keybind.c', and link everything.
[Two related files are (1) 'keynames.h' which #defines the F1 et al;
(2) 'keymap.c' which maps the scan codes to ascii values using the
intelligent key board of the ST.]

The standard control-, meta-key bindings, as they were in the original
MicroEmacs, are also valid.

	The Function Keys alter the buffer and/or file content; so be
cautious.  All the other special keys (the HELP-UNDO group, and the
numeric keypad group) only change the display, and/or windows; so you
can be playful with these.  The commands 'kill', 'yank' and 'read-file'
don't work as they do in full Emacs; so watch out.
