Yes there is; you need to compile the editor with STARTUP #defined
(see the instructions for making MG on your system for details).
Here's a copy of my .mg (which should be put in SYS$LOGIN:.MG on VMS,
$HOME/.mg on Unix, and s:.mg on the Amiga). Mike Meyer designed the
startup code to allow things that look like a GNU .emacs, but beware;
all it's really doing is putting the "important" parts of each line
into the input buffer, then executing the line.
