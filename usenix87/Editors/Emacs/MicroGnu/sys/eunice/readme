This directory contains sources that allow MicroEmacs to be compiled
and linked using Eunice cc.  Although I am the de facto Eunice hacker
at the site I work for, I don't have enough experience with it to
understand why it crashes for me when I attempt to run it under the
C shell.  If I give the command

	$ MG :== $dev:[dir]MG. MG

and invoke it from DCL, it works fine.  If you find out what's wrong
(probably something simple), let me know.

If you have the VAX C compiler, you might be better off using the native
VMS terminal/system modules, to avoid the overhead involved in running Eunice.
