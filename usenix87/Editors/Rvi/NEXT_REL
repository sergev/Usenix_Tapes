I have fixed some bugs in in the version of RVI that is posted to mod.sources
in Volume 7.   These bugs were found and repaired during the several
weeks it took for rvi to work its way through the network to mod.sources.
I would like to thank Richard Salz for his patience and effort in helping
me find a reliable path to his machine to get the darn thing posted already.

These bugs were pointed out to me by users at the Minnesota Supercomputer
Center.   I am indebted to their persistant efforts, both in finding the
bugs, and in their efforts to coax me into fixing them.

A list of bugs appears below.   I want to wait a few weeks before sending
the diffs so that I may incorporate additional bugfixes received from users
implementing the original distribution.

In the meantime, a version of rvi that incorporates the bugfixes received
so far is available via anonymous ftp.  The internet address is:
	umn-rei-uc.ARPA
The sources containing the bugfixes are stored in /staff/rvi/src.

A list of bugfixes follows.

------------------------------------------------------------------

Rvi now can fake deleteln and insertln for dumb terminals that do not
have a change_scroll or insertln/deleteln function.

w <file> resets the file_modified flag.

A possible coredump caused by deleting the last line in the file was fixed.

A spurious ed error message on editing an empty file was removed.

Editing a nameless file is now handled correctly for a few bad cases.

Remote invokation of rm and echo was changed to avoid conflicts with
shell aliasing.

Some error messages were made more verbose.

Rvi can now interrogate the terminal type remotely (requires putenv()).
