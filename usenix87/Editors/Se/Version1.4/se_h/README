README:

This directory contains the help files for the Georgia Tech Software Tools/UNIX
screen editor Se.  The files with the _swt suffix contain information
which is correct when the editor is in Software Tools compatibility mode.
This is the default at Georgia Tech.  The files without the _swt suffix either
contain information which is the same for both Unix and SWT modes, or for
Unix mode, which is the default at any place other than Georgia Tech.

The dohelp() routine checks what mode the editor is in, and reads in the
appropriate file.

The files should be installed in the directory /usr/lib/se_h for se in order
for se to find them. File names must be in lower case, since dohelp() maps
the file name into all lower case. (On pr1mes, case is not significant in
file names, so the original ratfor version did not have to do this.)
