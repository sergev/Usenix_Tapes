                                     Help

        You are using 'se', the  Georgia  Tech screen editor which  is
        based upon the editor described in the book SOFTWARE TOOLS, by
        Brian W.  Kernighan  and  P.   J.   Plauger   (Addison-Wesley,
        1976).   The  screen-oriented  modifications (and some others)
        are by  Jack  Waugh and  Perry  Flinn.  Dan Forsyth translated
        the Ratfor into C.  Arnold Robbins modified the editor to  use
        the Berkeley termlib library, making the editor terminal inde-
        pendant.  Most of this  'help' is  courtesy  of Bob  Gordon of
        Prime  Research, as  amended by  Arnold Robbins.  The descrip-
        tion before you now  is  invoked by the  "h" (help) command.

        For a description of the 'help' command, type "hh".
