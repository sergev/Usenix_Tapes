               default range             syntax
                  1,$                      of

        Typing  "of"  turns  on  a  package  of  options  considered
        convenient for editing Fortran.  The warning column  is  set
        to  72,  and tab spacing is set to 7 +3 so that tabbing once
        gets you to column 7.   Tab  expansion  is  also  turned  on
        (XTABS).   To  undo  "of" it is necessary to type "ot+3" and
        "ox".

        For general information about the option command, type "ho".
        See also "oa".
