        oh -- Option Hardware Insert/Delete

              default range             syntax
                 1,$                     oh

        The   "h"   option   controls   the  use  of  hardware  line
        insert/delete on terminals that have  that  capability.   By
        default,  line  insert/delete will be used if available.  It
        is occasionally useful to turn this option  off  when  using
        the editor on a terminal which can't keep up, or if the com-
        munications  lines may be scrambling the control characters.
        Each successive "oh" merely  toggles  a  switch  within  the
        editor.   An  explanatory  message  is  placed in the status
        line.

        For general information about the option command, type "ho".
