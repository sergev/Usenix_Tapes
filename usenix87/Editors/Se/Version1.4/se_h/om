        "om" is an option which allows the user control   over  whether
        or  not he will  be  notified  about pending mail.  Typing "om"
        simply toggles the switch controlling notification.
            The default is for the editor to notify the  user about his
        mail.  The  mail  box  which the editor uses is taken from  the
        environment variable MAIL. If the mail box exists, but is empty
        the user will not be notified.

        To  read your mail, use a shell escape on whichever of the fol-
        lowing programs is appropriate:

                Mail     msg     mail
