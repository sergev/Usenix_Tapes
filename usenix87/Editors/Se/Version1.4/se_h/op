        op -- Option Pattern

        default range                   syntax
            1,$                           op

        "op"  converts to  or from SWT  compatibility mode.  Se was originally
        written  for  the Georia  Tech  Software  Tools  Subsystem, which uses
        slightly different characters  for  describing  patterns.  To ease the
        transition for users familiar with the original version, se provides a
        Software Tools compatibility mode.  The current default is to use Unix
        style patterns and commands.  When in Software Tools mode, the message
        "SWT" appears  in the status line.

        Do  a "man se" from the shell for a complete  description of the  dif-
        ferences when in SWT mode and when in Unix mode.
