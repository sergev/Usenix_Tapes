            "ox" turns compression of tabs on or off. If a file
            has tabs in it, they will be  expanded  if compres-
            sion is on. Otherwise they will be left alone,  and
            will show up as the default unprintable character.

            The message "XTABS" will be displayed in the status
            line if tab compression is on.
