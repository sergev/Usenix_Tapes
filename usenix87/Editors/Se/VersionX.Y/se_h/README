README:

This directory contains the help files for the Georgia Tech Software Tools/UNIX
screen editor Se.

The files should be installed in the directory /usr/local/lib/se_h for se in
order for se to find them. File names must be in lower case, since dohelp() maps
the file name into all lower case. (On pr1mes, case is not significant in
file names, so the original ratfor version did not have to do this.)
