                              Argument Handling

        The syntax for 'se's invoking command is usually given as
            se {-<option> | <pathname>}
        It is suggested  that  you  set up a command  file  that  will
        automatically invoke 'se' with the options that you like.

        To see how the remaining arguments are treated, type "harg2".
        To return to the general help directory, type "hdir".
