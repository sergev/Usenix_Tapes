NAME
	te - TECO text editor

SYNOPSIS
	te [filename]

DESCRIPTION
	te is an implementation of TECO written in C to run under
	Ultrix 1.2.

	te implements DEC standard TECO, with some exceptions
	described below, plus some extensions for the Ultrix
	environment.

	te assumes a VT100-type terminal, and its display
	driver is hard-coded for such.

DOCUMENTATION
	The DEC Standard TECO book describes the basic editing
	functions of TECO.  teco.doc describes the differences
	between te and standard TECO, including the extensions
	for the Ultrix environment.  maketeco.doc describes the
	files that comprise te, and the build procedure.

FILES
	~/.tecorc	editor startup file
	<file>.tmp	temporary output file(s)
	<file>.bak	previous version of edited file
	/etc/termcap	describes terminal (used only to find width of VT100)

AUTHOR
	Matt Fichtenbaum, GenRad Inc., Concord, Mass.

BUGS
	te acquires memory for its buffer using malloc(), but
	never returns the space.  This can cause the task in
	memory to appear to be larger than it is.

	Several of the standard display features of TECO, most
	notably the -256+n:W command used by interpretive editing
	macros, are unimplemented.  There are undoubtedly some
	subtle bugs in the display handler for the features that
	are implemented.
