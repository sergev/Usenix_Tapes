This is a program which you may find useful for calculating different
financial formulas.  Probably the most interesting of the calculations
is the amortization schedule.

Compile as follows:

	cc -O -ltermcap -lm -o <outfile> <infile>

	where:

	<infile> is the name you have chosen for this source file

	<outfile> is the name of the executable file

P.S. Any fixes should be posted to the net.
