Below is an awk program for keeping track of stock investments,
although it can be used for others.  The program was originally
written by Gary Anderson.  I modified it for 80 column output
and added the code for reinvestment and cash distributions.

To use it, strip off everything outside the dotted lines,
make the file executable and

	roi < financial_record  | more

I would like to see a version written in C, so it would be more
portable.  The file financial_record is constructed as desribed
in the comments include in the program.

If you have any improvements or bug reports contact:
