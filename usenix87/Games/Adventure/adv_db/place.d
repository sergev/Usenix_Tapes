PLACE	BREATHTAKER
	 You're at breath-taking view.
	%You are on the edge of a breath-taking view. Far below you is an
	 active volcano, from which great gouts of molten lava come surging
	 out, cascading back down into the depths.  The glowing rock fills the
	 farthest reaches of the cavern with a blood-red glare, giving every-
	 thing an eerie, macabre appearance.  The air is filled with flickering
	 sparks of ash and a heavy smell of brimstone.  The walls are hot to
	 the touch, and the thundering of the volcano drowns out all other
	 sounds.  Embedded in the jagged roof far overhead are myriad twisted
	 formations composed of pure white alabaster, which scatter the murky
	 light into sinister apparitions upon the walls.  To one side is a deep
	 gorge, filled with a bizarre chaos of tortured rock which seems to
	 have been crafted by the devil himself.  An immense river of fire
	 crashes out from the depths of the volcano, burns its way through the
	 gorge, and plummets into a bottomless pit far off to your left.
	Across the gorge, the entrance to a valley is dimly visible.  To
	 the right, an immense geyser of blistering steam erupts continuously
	 from a barren island in the center of a sulfurous lake, which bubbles
	 ominously.  The far right wall is aflame with an incandescence of its
	 own, which lends an additional infernal splendor to the already

PLACE	FACES

	%You are standing at the southern end of a long valley illuminated by

	Some of them look down into the valley with expressions of
	benevolence that would credit a saint;  others glare with a malice
	that makes the heart grow faint.  All of them are imbued with a
	fantastic seeming of life by the shifting and flickering light of
	the volcano.  The entire far end of the valley is taken up by an
	immense carving of a seated figure;  its exact form cannot be seen
	from here due to the uncertainty of the light.

	%You are standing at the southern end of what appears to be a
	large room filled with multicolored fog.  The sides and far end
	of the room cannot be seen due to the thickness of the fog - it's
	a real pea-souper (even to the color in places!).  A passage leads
	back to the south;  a dull rumbling sound issues from the passage.

	The walls here are composed of the finest marble, and the floor is
	built of slabs of rare onyx and bloodstone.  The ceiling is high and

	a light like moon-light shining off of polished silver.
PLACE	AUDIENCE.E
	You're at east end of Audience Hall.

	Giant room) which has smooth, glassy-looking walls.  A passage enters
	from the south and exits to the north.
PLACE	LAIR
	You're in the Sorcerer's Lair.
	%This is the Sorcerer's Lair.  The walls are covered with exotic runes
	written in strange, indecipherable scripts;  the only readable phrase
	reads "noside samoht".  Strange shadows flit about on the walls, but
	there is nothing visible to cast them.  Iridescent blue light drips
	from a stalactite far above, falls towards the floor, and evaporates
	before touching the ground.  A deep, resonant chanting sound vibrates
	from deep in the ground beneath your feet, and a whispering sound
	composed of the echoes of long-forgotten spells and cantrips seeps
	from the walls and fills the air.  Passages exit to the east and west.
PLACE	BRINK.1
	You're at brink of bottomless pit.
	%You are standing on the brink of what appears to be a bottomless pit

PLACE	BRINK.2
	You're on southern edge of bottomless pit.
	%You are standing at the south end of a ledge running around the west
	side of a bottomless pit.  The ledge once continued around to the east

	years ago.  A cold wind blows out of a tunnel leading to the southeast.
PLACE	ICE
	You're in Ice room.
	%You are in the Ice room.  The walls and ceiling here are composed of
	clear blue glacial ice;  the floor is fortunately made of rock and
	is easy to walk upon.  There is a passage leading to the northwest,

	were to slide down it you probably couldn't get back up.
PLACE	SLIDE
	You're at bottom of icy slide.
	%You're at the entrance to an extensive and intricate network of tunnels
	carved out of solid ice.  A slippery slope leads upwards and north, but

PLACE	ARCH.COR.1
	You're in coral passage.
	%You are in an arched coral passage which enters from the west, splits,
	and continues on to the east over a smooth and damp-looking patch of
	sand.  The fork in the passage once led to the south, but it is now
	completely blocked by debris.
PLACE	ARCH.COR.2
	You're at bend in arched coral corridor.
	%You are at a bend in an arched corral passage;  the passage enters
	from the west over a patch of damp sand, turns, and continues north.
PLACE	ARCH.FORK
	You're at fork in arched corral passage.
	%You are at a fork in a high, arched coral passage.  The main portion
	of the passage enters from the south;  two smaller passages lead

PLACE	JONAH
	You're at entrance to the Jonah room.
	%You are standing at the entrance of the Jonah room, a cavernous
	hall with high ribbed walls.  The hall extends far to the south;
	a coral passage leads west.
PLACE	IN.JONAH
	You're at south end of the Jonah room.
	%You are at the south end of the Jonah room.  Ahead of you, the way
	is barred by a large set of immense stalactites and stalagmites
	which intermesh like clenched teeth.  Nothing except blackness is
	visible between the stone formations.
PLACE	FOURIER
	You're in the Fourier passage.
	%You are in the Fourier passage.  This is a long and highly convoluted
	passage composed of coral, which twists and turns like the path of
	an earthworm tripping on LSD.  The passage here enters from the
	northwest, convulses, and exits to the southwest (from which
	direction can be felt a cool and salty-smelling breeze).
PLACE	SHELF
	You're on shelf of rock above beach.
	%You are standing on a large shelf of sedementary rock overlooking
	a lava beach.  The shelf is an extension of an incredible cliff
	which extends north, south, and upwards for as far as the eye can
	see.  Crudely carved steps lead down from the shelf to the beach, and
	a twisting coral passage exits to the west.
PLACE	BEACH
	You're on beach.
	%You are standing on a short, barren beach composed of hardened lava.
	Rugged and unclimbable volcanic hills block all view to the north
	and south, and a seemingly infinite cliff fills the entire western
	hemisphere.  To the east, a narrow inlet of ocean water laps gently
	upon the beach.  The scene is illuminated by the light of three small
	moons shining through the shimmering glow of an aurora that fills
	the entire sky with golden splendor.  Steps lead up the cliff to a
	shelf of rock.
PLACE	PLATFORM
	You're on tiny platform above volcano.
	%You are precariously perched on a tiny platform suspended in midair.
	Two thousand feet below you is the mouth of a very active volcano,
	spewing out a river of hot lava.
*
PLACE	LIMBO
*        Limbo is the normal holding area for objects that aren't
*        currently visible in the cave.  All special objects
*        (dwarf, pirate, axe, treasure chest, pearl, etc) start
*        out here and are moved to the apropriate places in the
*        cave at the proper times.  The nest of golden eggs
*        ends up here the first time you give it to the troll
*        and may be fetched back to the Giant room with the
*        Fee Fie Foe Foo sequence;  the second time you try to
*        give it to the troll it ends up in Ylem (q.v.) and
*        can't be gotten back.  The Oyster starts out here and
*        is swapped with the Clam when you succeed in opening the
*        clam with the trident.  Needless to say, there is no
*        way that the adventurer should be able to get to Limbo
*        (unless he is a wizard using the master-mode commands)
*        since he could do all kinds of nasty things here (get the
*        batteries without paying the coins, get the rug without
*        first killing the dragon, get the food back after feeding
*        the bear, move the clam to the house, etc.)  Very nasty!
*
	You are in Limbo.
	%You are in Limbo (program bug!).  Say OUT to get out of here.
PLACE	YLEM
*
*        Ylem must be the last place defined (following Limbo).  It is
*        intended as a trash-can place - objects moved to Ylem are
*        forever inaccessable (coding convention only - no enforcement
*        by the handlers).  Currently Ylem is used as follows:  if
*        you cheat the troll out of the nest of golden eggs (as you
*        must if you wish to get full score) and then try to bribe
*        him with them a second time, he lets them sail into the chasm
*        and demands something else;  the eggs are moved to Ylem, and
*        the Fee Fie Foe Foo logic will recognize this and refuse to
*        fetch them back to the Giant room again.  Ylem is also used
*        in the fall-to-a-painful-death logic (label SPLATTER and
*        a couple of miscellaneous calls also) so that if you fall from
*        someplace and would end up lying dead at some location
*        that isn't really defined (the bottom of the chasm,
*        in the volcanic gorge, etc) the things you were carrying
*        get deposited in an inaccessable location.
*
	You are in Ylem.
