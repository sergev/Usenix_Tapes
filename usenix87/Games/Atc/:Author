I modified Ed James' ATC game to run under System V, folded in
Mark VandeWettering's sorting fix, and added a shell escape ('!').
There were several changes to simply the makefile structure, and to
accomodate 14-character filename restrictions.

All you need to do is unpack the archive, edit Makefile to reflect your
OS version and directory structure, and type "make install".

This version has been beta-tested by me and my friends, but is not
guaranteed bug-free.  Report any problems to me at:

	ihnp4!cuae2!djmolny       *OR*
	attmail!dmolny

Enjoy.
