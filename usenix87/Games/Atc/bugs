There is a bug in Ed James's "atc" (air-traffic controller) game.
Since the fix simply involves changing the order of two lines, I'll
just explain it rather than post a context diff.

In graphics_curses.c, reverse the order of the first two executable
statements in init_gr().  They should read
	setbuf(stdout, buffer);
	initscr();

The other way around, any terminal initialization string ('ti') output
by curses gets lost.  Under xterm (X Window Package terminal emulator),
the bug causes xterm to get locked up when atc is run in a virgin X window,
since sending the terminal finalization string without first sending the
terminal initialization string locks up xterm.
