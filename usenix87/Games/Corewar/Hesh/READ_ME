This is the second source distribution of the Core Wars.

Some of the bugs that have been fixed:

	1. unrc.c has been modified to recognize the MUL, DIV
	   and RND instructions.
	2. cw.6 had some problems with the tables.  These have
	   been solved.
	3. The RND instruction no longer causes a job to halt.
	4. A bug in the lexical analyzer where the toggle variable
	   "toggle" wasn't being toggled has been corrected.

For further reading on the origins and purpose of this system,
please see the the "SEE ALSO" section of the documentation.

Please send all new bug reports to the author.

This is the first source distribution of the game of Core Wars.
This game has been tested on BSD4.2 UNIX.  It should run under
any UNIX system that has curses, lex and yacc and virtual memory
and whose compiler allows bitfields in structures.
If your system does not have virtual memory but does have separate
I and D space, you should insert the appropriate loader options in
the Makefile.  You may also have to decrease "MAX_MEM" and make the
corresponding changes to the bitfield widths.

I think that it would be great if we could have world wide competition
playing this game.  Perhaps people could post their best redcode code
to net.sources.games.  Perhaps an unbeatable program might evolve.
