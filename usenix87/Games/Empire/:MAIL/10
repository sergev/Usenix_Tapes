re: Version 1.1 makefile problem?

Has anyone else experienced the makefile problem mentioned by Sean
Casey (ukma!sean)?  I'm not sure what directories are involved, but if the
reference was to the EMPIRE and EMPCRE directories, I don't agree with
Sean's recommendation to add the $(LIBDIR).  Those two directories
contain a subdirectory named _unix.O to hold the empire.o and empcre.o
objects.  Those two objects shouldn't be placed in the library
directory, ../_unix.O, where empsub.a, empcom.a, empdis.o, and empglb.o
live.
Actually, it won't hurt anything if they get put there... but that
wasn't the intent.
I've seen the makefiles bomb if the directories weren't created properly
by the tar command.  Make will complain if the _unix.O directory isn't
there, and I think the compiler complains if the ownership & mode don't allow
writing.  If that was the problem, all you have to do is create the directory
with mode 755.

If anyone has solutions to the 3b2 problems - please mail them to me
at ihnp4!druxn!tsf.  I don't have access to a 3b2 (yet).  The only
problems I've heard of so far are the execl problem and something to
do with floating point.  I think you have to compile it with some kind
of option or empcre will die at the first floating point operation.
