To all the Version 1.1 recipients who got the release in tar
archive or shell archive form:  the directory structure of the
release wasn't picked up by the tar command.  Normally I use cpio
to archive and distribute the package, but for writing tapes, I use
tar.  I get into the Version 1.1 directory and issue the command:
	tar cf /dev/rmt8 20 .
Then I read it back using:
	tar tf /dev/rmt8
If the tape reads OK twice, I ship it.  ukma!sean and ucdavis!minnie!ccrdan
report that the tar release was missing seven empty directories. 

Here are the directories that were missing:
	./_unix.O
	./BIN
	./DATA
	./EMPIRE/_unix.O
	./EMPCRE/_unix.O
	./EMPFIX/_unix.O
	./EMPN/_unix.O
They're supposed to be there, empty, before doing the make.  Here is the
result of a   find . -type d -print
.
./hdrs
./_unix.O
./BIN
./DATA
./EMPSUBS
./EMPIRE
./EMPIRE/_unix.O
./EMPGLB
./EMPCRE
./EMPCRE/_unix.O
./EMPDIS
./COMMANDS
./EMPFIX
./EMPFIX/_unix.O
./EMPN
./EMPN/_unix.O
./INFO

Sorry for the inconvenience.  I'll add something to the makefile in
Version 1.2 to set up the proper structure.  For all tapes made from
December 1, 1985 on, I'll make sure the Version 1.1 tar archive has
the empty directories. I'm emailing this info to Dan (ccrdan), and I
think he's planning to change the shell archives too.
