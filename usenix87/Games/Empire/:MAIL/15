I just got access to a 3b2, and discovered some of the same problems
reported by ukma!sean.

1) empcre core dumps at first floating point operation.
	Fix: compile AND load with the -f option.  The way I did this
	     was to set CC="cc -f" and export it.  Then do a 
	     make -e all.

2) You get a core dump at the first exec.
	Fix: Make the fix suggested by Sean in sigsave.c.  Change all the
	     -1's to 1's.  There are two occurrences in the file.

3) Empcre reports screwy statistics after making the world, census data
   has strange numbers, random sectors have the plague right after
   creation, and the power command dumps memory.
	Fix: In empcre.c, initialize the scts, type, elcnts, and powbuf
	     arrays.  They were on the stack and uninitialized.  Initialize
	     the arrays to zero.

I've only looked at the 3b2 version a little bit so far, and the
fixes shown above aren't soaked.  They appear to fix the problems on
the 3b2.  I'll post other fixes as I find them.  Fix #3 above might have
fixed the bug in empcre that prevents the creation of 127x127 worlds. 
I haven't tried it yet.
