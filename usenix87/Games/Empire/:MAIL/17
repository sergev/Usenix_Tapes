.TH OLDEMPIRE 6 "9 January 1986"
.UC 4
.SH NAME
oldempire \- A Simulation of Territorial Conquest
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B /usr/games/oldempire
[
Country_Name
<
Representative
>
]
.PP
.I Country_Name
\- The name of the country you are currently playing.
.PP
.I Representative
\- Your 'password' into
.I Empire.  
This prevents unauthorized use of your country while you are away from your 
terminal.

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.I OldEmpire,
to be referred to as
.I Empire,
is a multi-player simulation game involving economic and military factors.
Even though there is no real 'object' to the game, players develop
their own, ranging from being the biggest, strongest country in existence,
to having the lowest military/civilian ratio possible, while not being
overrun by the other countries.
.PP
In
.I Empire,
players manage the resources of their countries in a 'realtime'
environment.  Each player at the start is given two sectors, 254 
civilians, 254 military, and 254 tons of iron ore.  Each sector can
be designated as any of the various choices, an iron mine, gold mine,
capital, harbor, airfield, and many more.  To obtain more sectors,
players must explore the world around them, by moving military or 
civilians into unexplored sectors adjacent to ones they currently own.
.PP
.I Empire
is a long term game.  It takes a day or two to make significant changes 
in a player's country.  Players 'login' to their country (by executing
.I Empire)
each day or so to see how things are going.  They then can alter things
a little, by moving ore, civilians, military, etc. to other sectors.
.SH GETTING STARTED
.PP
To get started (i.e. apply for a country), try to 'login' to
.I Empire
under a garbage Country Name and Representative. 
.I Empire
will then come back at you saying that there is no country of that name
in the records, and will say that if you wish to apply for a country or
just observe the game, go see SoandSo, where SoandSo is the game 
administrator.  Send mail to this person and he or she will create a
country for you.



.SH WRITING FILES FROM OLDEMPIRE
.PP
From inside
.I Empire
you are able to write files to the current directory using the standard
Un*x redirection character '>'.  However, if
.I Empire
is running under a different userID, as it would where there is a games
system installed, the current directory MUST have public write permission
set.  Otherwise, 
.I Empire
will be unable to write the data.

.SH MORE INFORMATION
.PP
Assuming that your site has the Visitor country implemented, you
can 'login' to
.I Empire
as 'Visitor', hitting Return when it asks you for your name.  You will 
have a very limited set of commands available to you.  Make sure you
read the 'info overview' information.  To 'logout' of
.I Empire,
type 'bye' and hit Return.

.SH ONLINE HELP FILES
.PP
All the online help files that you can read inside empire can be found
in /usr/games/lib/oempire/INFO.  They are in nroff format.

.SH AUTHORS
Peter Langston,
Joe Stetson,
Robert Bradbury,
and others.
.PP
Decompilation of 11/70 object code to current form done by
Tom S. Fisher.  Many thanks, Tom!
.PP
This Man page written by Lewis R. Jansen.

.SH BUGS
.PP
Probably infinite in both magnitude and number.
