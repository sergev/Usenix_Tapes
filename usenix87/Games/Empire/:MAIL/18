An open letter to the people whose games tapes I just mailed back...

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

						January 13, 1986

Dear Long-Suffering Game Enthusiast,


Well, I've procrastinated long enough; far too long, actually.

I keep waiting for the development activity to die down on these games so
I can be sure they're really bullet-proof and bug-free before sending them,
but I've had to realize an unpleasant truth; the only time I'm not making
changes in the games is when I'm too busy on other projects.  Consequently,
the only time I could put together a distribution is when I don't have time.


Stranger:	Say farmer, why don't you fix your roof?  It's leaking!

Farmer:		Are you crazy? I ain't gonna get up there in all this rain!

Stranger:	Well then, why don't you fix it when it's not raining?

Farmer:		What for?  It doesn't leak then!


So, here it is;
this is the 4.2 BSD version with some new features and some new bugs...

I just mailed 14 tapes out, some that I've been holding for quite a while
( > 4 years in one case).  If you sent me a tape within the last 4 years and
indicated you wanted a 4.2 BSD Vax version then you might want to remember
where you were when you sent it and make sure they know how to forward mail
to you...

Peter
