I have a question about submarines and coastwatch.
It seems that submarines show up on coastwatch in
the version of empire we have been using at Berkeley.

Anyone know if this is a feature or a bug?

David desJardins and I were allies in the last empire
game here over Xmas break, until we wiped out all of
our principal enemies. Then having nothing better to
do we agreed on groundrules for a naval war. A real
battle royal ensued, in which we both tried out various
strategies.

The naval strategy I have been fooling around with has
been to build lots of subs and split them into "wolf-packs"
of 5 or 10 or so, then go around sinking any ships I manage
to discover, afterwards running away out of sight.

But if subs are going to show up on coastwatch it complicates
my task as I have to hide away from my enemies coasts.

ps- I would be interested in naval strategies any of the
    readers have dreamed up ...
