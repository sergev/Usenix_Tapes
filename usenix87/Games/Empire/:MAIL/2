Status: R

This letter is being sent to all those folks who asked me for a copy of my
version of Empire, which is heavily!!!! based on Peter Langston's latest
version.  Peter has given me permission to redistribute it.  Be advised that my
version differs from PSL's in several ways. 

Peter has recently added some features (and removed some) that I have decided
not to copy (or delete).  For example, I have not removed exchange sectors,
but, rather, fixed them so that old hacks are no longer feasible.  By removing
Exchanges, I think that Peter has removed the (only) means by which countries
may cooperate with each other. 

I also do not agree with Peter's implementation HAPPINESS, and, how it affects
enlistments, etc.  My concept of happiness, and my implementation differ
greatly from his, and, the people who have played my version really like the
way I have it. 

Other differences are mostly bug/hack fixes (about 40 or so bug fixes,
involving about 200-300 actual code changes!)

Now, here is how you can get your (source) copy of Empire:

	1) Get yourself a tape (big enough to hold about 3 Megabytes of stuff,
	   tar format)
	   [ or see 2a below ]

	2) Make yourself a stamped/metered, self addressed package (with
	   adequate postage for your location) that is big enough to hold the
	   tape.
	   [ or see 2a below ]

	Do 2a) only if you do not do 1) and 2)!!!!!
	2a) Send me $30 and a mailing address.
	    No cash.  No stamps.
	    No P.O.'s, No billing.
	    CASHIERS CHECK or PERSONAL CHECK or MONEY ORDERS only.
	
	3) Get a copy of your Unix V6, V7, PWB, System III, or System V Unix
	   SOURCE!!! license signature page.  (Berkeley licenses are
	   unacceptable!) (Photocopies only)

	   My version of Empire has a "machine" dependent part that includes
	   some duplicated code from the C library and math library.  Hence,
	   the need for Unix SOURCE license verification.

	4) Get the name of a contact person who is responsible for maintaining
	   the security and protecting any copyrights (Langston's or mine) on
	   the Empire source code.  This person must guarantee that the code is
	   NOT distributed any further than the machine(s) for which it is
	   requested.

	   Anyone else who wants a copy MUST get it ONLY from me.  Each
	   distribution will be Unique, and I will maintain a list of who has
	   what so that updates (no pun intended) may be distributed properly.

	5) Package up all the stuff above and send it to me via U.S.Mail (or
	   UPS) at this address:
		John Buck
		Empire Distribution Center, Rm. 246
		M.R.I. Computer Facility
		Polytechnic Institute of New York
		Route 110
		Farmingdale, New York 11735

	I will make up tapes Once a week (on the weekend)  so, if you send it
	out monday, you'll probably have it back in 10-12 days, depending on
	the postage.

	Questions?  Call me at 516-454-5191 (9AM-9PM Eastern Time)

	There will be NO exceptions to the above rules.  Do not ask.  There are
	also NO binary ONLY distributions.  If you do not have a source
	license, sorry.  You should probably deal with PSL, since he
	distributes ONLY BINARIES of his version.
