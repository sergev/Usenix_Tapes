Well, for all those folks who have a version of empire from 1984 (end of),
coastwatch CAN NOT WORK.  It is broken.  It uses the wrong numbers, and
often prints random stuff as results.  My version has this (and many, many
other bugs) fixed.

Essentially, it was using the wrong structures (sect instead of ship)
in its computation of visibility.  The results were often bizarre.

mail to me if you want info on obtaining new version of Empire.
