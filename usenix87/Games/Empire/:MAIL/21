After an exhaustive empire campaign played here recently, a group of us have
come up with some possible additions to enhance empire. 

I'd be interested in any one comments on these, or if some one has tried adding
any of these ideas to an existing empire implementation.  Be warned, the ideas
become progressively wilder!

P.S.  Does anyone in the U.K.  have a src for empire, I might try experimenting
if I could get hold of it. 

------------------------------

These comments pertain to our current empire which is

	Export Version of Feb 26 1985
	(Probably out of date by now.)

	The following parameters have been set for this game:
	World size is 128 by 32
	An Empire time unit is 1800 seconds long
	Each country is allowed to be logged in 120 minutes a day.
	There can be up to 16 countries.
	Food growth rate (`fgrate') is 0.0020
	Food harvest rate (`fcrate') is 0.0020
	People eat 0.0005 units of food per time unit.
	Babies eat 0.3000 units of food becoming adults.
	Birth rate is 0.0100 in urban centers, 0.0050 elsewhere.
	Banks pay $0.1250 interest per gold bar per time unit.

Money.
	There is clearly something wrong with the way selling food (at least)
	is handled.  No one here was every bothered in the least by money, the
	loan command was redundant and we had several mulit-millionaires. 
	Either decrease the value of food or increase the cost of everything
	else.  [food_price/=10, or anything_cost*=10, or even both]

New ship ideas
	Cargo ships ought to be able to carry lcm & hcm, or perhaps new type
	(container ship?) is needed.  Alternatively, a cargo ship can carry a
	total of 200 of any mix of commodities.  Also a special ship to supply
	oil derricks, and offload oil from same, or else allow oil derricks to
	act as harbours for the purpose of loading and unloading. 

Planes.
	These are very boring compared to the comparable handling of ships.  I
	suggest a strategy much like the way ships are handled.  Numerous types
	of planes.  As a starter

	$$$  tec  lcm  hcm  drop civ  mil  cargo fuel land
	100  50	  50   50   0	 2    0	   5	 5    1	   cessna
	200  100  100  100  20	 0    2	   20	 10   0	   harrier
	500  150  150  150  5	 0    25   50	 25   0	   chinook
	2000 200  300  300  0	 0    150  200	 100  2	   galaxy
	3000 200  300  300  40	 0    10   40	 100  2	   B52
	200  100  100  100  0	 10   0	   10	 20   1	   learjet
	500  150  100  100  0	 20   0	   20	 20   0	   jetranger
	3000 200  300  300  0	 150  0	   200	 100  2	   Jumbo

tec = technology level required to build it.
lcm/hcm = materials required to build.
drop = no. of bombs it can drop/flight.
civ = no. of civilians
mil = no. of military
cargo = amount of cargo it can carry in total (shells, guns - excl mil & civ).
fuel = amount of fuel (which governs range)
land = landing type
	0 take off & land anywhere except sea & mountain.
	1 take off & land on 50% airfield or 100% highway
	2 take off & land on 100% airfield.

	Planes depend on fuel (to be decided).  Have a certain capacity of fuel
	tank which gives them range.  More tech = more efficient use of fuel. 

Bridges
	You ought to be able to build these over mountains, and perhaps call
	them tunnels then - also build bridges over wasteland.  This would
	enable mountainous areas to be tamed at the expense of large quantities
	of hcm. 

Harbours
	Harbours allowed to be built next to sea or harbours.  This would allow
	canals to be dug linking oceans.  Perhaps a harbour not bordering on
	the sea should need hcm & lcm to construct it. 

Gold Bars
	Perhaps you could melt down gold bars into gold dust again! Otherwise
	they are pretty useless and tend to get eaten up pretty quickly Another
	possibilty is to use gold bars as interntional trade.  e.g.  100 units
	of food = 1 gold bar, can only buy from other people via gold (hard
	currency).  You should be able to sell commodities to other countries
	as well as the deity.  This could probably include education,
	technology and research. 

Fuel (for ships & planes)
	Fuel is produced from oil by refineries (see below), the range a
	ship/plane can move on one unit of fuel is dependent on the technology
	factor.  Ships & planes have limited fuel capacity.  Ship have mobility
	as at present which limits distance/day. 

		range = fuel * tech+10/tech+20 (????)

Refinery (sector)
	Convert oil to fuel. fuel = oil * 10
			     p.e. = tech+50 / tech+200
	Costs $5 per unit of fuel.

Nukes
	Nukes are like bombs i.e.  have no motive power of their own.  Can be
	dropped from heavy bombers or affixed to rockets (see below).  Nukes
	should need uranium to construct.  If this is a very rare commodity
	(e.g.  only 5 or 6 sectors with it in) this would make competition for
	these sectors & trade more interesting.  Uranium should be
	inexhaustable, but hard to extract. 

Starbase
	This provides an interesting extension to the game.  Above a given tec
	level rockets can be built.  Rockets have a certain range.  Above a
	certain limit, a rocket goes into orbit.  Beneath that limit it's only
	good as an ICBM.  A rocket with sufficient range can launch a satelite
	into orbit.  As tec level goes up the satellite gives more detail about
	what it can see.  To start with it can see land, sea & mountains. 
	Eventually it can identify what different sectors are and maybe
	eventually be able to give a spy report on them.  Satellites can be
	extended to include orbiting warheads, hunter-killer satellites, star
	wars and even orbiting colonies. 

	At really huge tech levels Starbases can build passenger rockets to fly
	to other worlds that are empire games running on other networked
	machine.  Some small amount of trade can then be done between the two
	worlds via unmanned drone rockets providing an embassy is set up on the
	other world.  Trade to & from spacestations can be done with rockets. 
	Above given tech level, rockets are reusable (a la shuttle). 

Happiness
	This could go negative.  If so a sector without N% (N ~ - Happiness)
	military may riot and become independant.  A presence of MP's is thus
	required to maintain order. 

Nuclear Accidents
	They do occur in real life ...

New Sector designations
	A 2 bit quantity attached to each sector saying whether that sector is
	normal, underground, undersea or in space (in order of increasing
	technology).  Special sectors have a limited designation and may
	require a supply of materials to keep them efficient. 

	Bunker:
	mine -> 100% mine
	100% mine -> 0% tunnel "bridgehead"
	build + hcm
	tunnel in given direction (under mountain)
	100% tunnel == highway
	100% tunnel + hcm -> 0% bunker
	100% bunker + lcm -> [capital|research|nuclear silo|
			fort|tech centre]

	Undersea:
	100% derrick can des sector 0% undersea
	civ + hcm -> 100% undersea
	redes + lcm -> [tech|research|agriculture|fort|
			refinery|oil|mine|gold]
	or tunnel -- to above

	space:
	rocket + civ + hcm -> 0% space station
	hcm -> 100% space station
	redes + lcm -> [tech|research|fort|radar|weather]
			<mine (asteroids)| agri (hydroponics) | lcm/hcm>

	All require 1 hcm per % efficiency, and 1 lcm/day to maintain
	efficiency otherwise loose 1% eff/day.  Undersea & space tech&research
	are more efficient & require fewer materials.  To redesignate a 100%
	sector to next class requires 1lcm/2% efficiency.
