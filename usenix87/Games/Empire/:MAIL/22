I have already written a "satellite" utility program for Empire.  Currently
there are three types of satellites that can be launched:

	1) return world data as mountain, sea, or land.
	2) same as 1, but also shows country ownership.
	3) same as 2, but also shows sector type.

The current scheme requires certain tech levels and LOTS of money to launch a
satellite.  They are:

	1) tech >=  70, money =  $100000
	2) tech >= 150, money =  $250000
	3) tech >= 300, money = $1000000

These are easily configurable at compile time. 

The program asks for a country name and password and then checks the tech level
and money.  Note that this is a seperate program as I don't have the sources to
Empire to integrate the command into the game (PSL are you listening???).  The
output of the program is a text file that contains the sector coordinates,
sector owner, and sector type. 

I also have a program that converts that file to HPGL graphics language for
plotting the world on a plotter in different colors!

I can post the source if there is enough interest.
