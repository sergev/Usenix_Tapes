John Buck (john@polyof) has gotten a moderately good source ('85 i think)
from Langston along with permission to redistribute it.  He has maintained
it, and fixed a lot of bugs.  He will send you a copy if you send him a
SAST (Self Addressed Stamped Tape) and if you agree not to redistribute it.
I'm talking real sources, not vaporware.

By the way, I've been beating and beating on the sources and throwing
terminals out the window (the code is horrible) and I've just about gotten
the thing to work on a 3B2 and 3B20.  Only problem is the program can't
correctly read the "mchrstr" structure and you can't load anything on
ships.  Once it all works and is verified, those changes may make their
way into the official release.  :-)
