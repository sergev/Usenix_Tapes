Anyone interested in receiving MY version of empire (based on PSL's of
4/85) should send me mail at:
	decvax!mcnc!{philabs!ron1,rti-sel}!polyof!john

We have just completed verification of the latest Beta test version which
supports a "common market" instead of the standard (random) "contract"
command.  Uranium, survey and few other NEW goodies have been implemented,
and seem to work just fine. (The users like them anyway.)

As for the "making a tape can be a drag" statement Scott made, this
is not true.  The load has been totally manageable; I keep on top of
it; as soon as the tape comes in, it gets written and sent out immediately.
(It is about 1.5MB of stuff (including documentation, no binaries, sources
and makefiles only).  I put 3 TAR copies on the tape, in case the first
one or two are bad.

To date I have sent out about 12 copies.  When you send me mail requesting
it, I will send you a (lengthy 4 page) letter describing how you can get
your copy. (Beware: A source UNIX license is required, and, you MAY NOT
redistribute it once you get it!!!!!!!  These are the rules.)

Also, I periodically post bug fixes to this group for those who have
my version.
(These posting are quite rare, I assure you.  There ARE no bugs in empire.)
