[ Dan goes on to tell how to e-mail him to get uucp via diskettes or tape. ]

I am posting this here (and cross-posting to rec.games.empire) as it
appears that not everyone saw my original posting in net.sources.games.
I apologize for those net.land.people who have already seen this.

What follows is the article I posted about 2 weeks ago.

Please note that in the period of time since my first posting, more
than 50 sites have snarfed these sources.  Several people sent e-mail
to me saying they were successful in compiling empire on their <insert
system model here> after slight tweeking of the Makefiles.  This
includes both BSD and ATT Un*x sites (as I recall).

I have directed followups to net.sources.games as that is one of the
newsgroups that I most frequently read.

=== BEGIN ================= net/sources/games/201 =============================

[ No, this article does not contain Empire sources.  Sorry.
  It does, however, tell you how you can *get* them via uucp! ]

Back in early February, several people requested the source code to
Empire.  I responded to each of them saying that I had Empire sources,
but that I would NOT mail them.  Also, I will not post them because of
their size--550K+ including the Empire_Manual which is 104K by itself.

What I *will* do (and have done) is make them available via anonymous
uucp from my site.  The sources are contained in 9 shar files.  These
files have been compressed with the popular "compress" program using
its 12-bit option.

Here's what we're talking about.  Someone had mentioned that they had a
part Fortran, part C version.  This version is completely written in C.
However, I don't know if it will compile cleanly.  I have never
attempted to compile Empire here (who has time for games?).

The vers.c files says:

    Version 1.1 Old Empire
    Oct 1985
    (decompiled 1983 from PDP 11/70 object)

An "ls -l" of the files:

    total 523
    -rw-r--r--   1 empire   uucp       34688 Mar 22 10:22 Part01.Z
    -rw-r--r--   1 empire   uucp       27878 Mar 22 10:17 Part02.Z
    -rw-r--r--   1 empire   uucp       35225 Mar 22 10:16 Part03.Z
    -rw-r--r--   1 empire   uucp       30386 Mar 22 10:16 Part04.Z
    -rw-r--r--   1 empire   uucp       25580 Mar 22 10:16 Part05.Z
    -rw-r--r--   1 empire   uucp       27718 Mar 22 10:15 Part06.Z
    -rw-r--r--   1 empire   uucp        9518 Mar 22 10:15 Part07.Z
    -rw-r--r--   1 empire   uucp       51911 Mar 22 10:15 Part08.Z
    -rw-r--r--   1 empire   uucp       18329 Mar 22 10:15 Part09.Z

To obtain these files, you must first place an entry similar to the
one below into your L.sys (or Systems under HoneyDanBer) file:

empire Any ACU <baudrate> 1-215-398-7543 ogin:-BREAK-ogin:-BREAK-ogin: empire word: anonymous

where <baudrate> is any of 300, 1200 or 2400.

Then issue the appropriate uucp command to get them.  For example:

    uucp empire!~/Part01.Z /usr/spool/uucppublic

would retrieve the Part01.Z file into your uucppublic directory.  Note
that trying something like "empire!~/Part*" (or any other wildcard
combination) probably will *not* work.  To get all nine files will
require that you issue 9 different commands similar to the one above.

If you have any difficulties, contact me via e-mail (address in my
.signature below).

Happy UUCP'ing.
