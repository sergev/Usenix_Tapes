If you want a copy of Empire (and a few other games) for Eighth Edition
Unix, 4.2 BSD, 4.2 BSD, or a pdp11 (probably not 2.9 BSD, but I'm not
sure), I can provide such.  I distribute mostly object modules with some
sources for system dependent and configurable parameters (sorry, this is
YARDS - Yet Another Refusal to Distribute Sources).  The available systems
are listed in order of decreasing currency, i.e. the Eighth Edition version
is the newest and the pdp11 stuff is ancient.
To get the infamous "psl Games Distribution" you need to send me a self-
addressed stamped tape (600' is plenty).  Unless you specify otherwise
I'll use tar 1600 bpi & 4.2 BSD.  The address is:
