Gee, it would seem there ARE still people out there using the OLD OLD OLD
Empire (grid sector layout, not the "new" hex layout).  Anyway,  this is
actually quite an old hack, and turning sea into land (or bridge spans into
land) is NOT the best way to use it.  (Who would want to turn a span into
land anyway?????  Spans cost 0 mobility to move across, even 100% 
normal sectors costs mobility.   spans are better).. Be that as it may,
this same feature is available through load, trade/set, move, transport,
etc.  Checkpoint sector (with a span or road, dont even have to do this).

One partner goes to move people off the span, the other guy redesignates
the bridge head.  The bridge collapses (and takes EVERYTHING that was on
the bridge with it, there is no getting this stuff back, it really does
get destroyed)

The other guy, who still has his move in progress, then drops the people
on the 'sea'.  He now owns the sea with people on it.  You may now
redesignate it cause you own it..  Old, stupid versions of Empire do
not check for such things as 'active' sectors.  My version, anyway,
does not let you do anything to a sector that someone has active.  (move
in progress, attack in progress, load, etc.)  This was the
Empire Bug for October, but, it seems we get to air it a bit early.

You can win a game of empire in 3 hours with this bug.  IE make it impossible
for anyone to approach your population or power.  (If you know
how to use it the right way).   Of course, I'm speaking for the OLD empire
game only.  Newer releases tend to correct most of these annoyances, and
eliminate most cheating.

PS to all those who have requested my C source version of Empire...  I have
written up a procedure for "How to get My Copy of Empire".  I have submitted
it to Peter Langston (author of the original Empire) for his approval.  I have
not heard from him yet, when I do I will send mail to all those who have sent
me mail asking for my version.  Please be patient, you have not been forgotten.
And besides, new bugs are being corrected weekly.  (Not daily like they
were 2 years ago!).
