For those of you using the map making program, some rules you
should follow are:

1) The maximum number of cities is 70. Exceeding this will cause
unpredictable program behavior. Less than 60 cities makes for a
boring game.

2) Do not put any cities on the edge of the map.

3) Island cities are OK (cities surrounded by water).

4) Do not make continents with only 1 city on them. These will cause
the computer strategy to fail.

5) Each continent needs at least 1 'port' city. Otherwise, if one
starts out on that continent, one can never get off it!

6) Do not have any 'lakes' with port cities on them.

Not following these rules will cause:

1) Program crashes (for 1) or 2)).

2) The computer strategy will fail.

3) A boring game.

These are the reasons why empire reads fixed data files instead
of randomly generating a map each time it is run.

Have fun!
