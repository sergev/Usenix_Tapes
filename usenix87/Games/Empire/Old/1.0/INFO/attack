.TH Command : ATTACK
.s1
The attack command is used to conquer sectors owned by other
countries.  It should not be used to take over unoccupied
sectors ("move" can do that).
.s1
To attack a sector type:
.EX attack 12,-7
This will initiate the attack sequence against sector
12,-7 (note: you may only attack one sector at a time).
You will be informed of the sector's status, e.g.
.ti 3
Sector 34,45 is a 15% fortress with 40 military or so.
.s1
At this point you will be asked how many military you
wish to dedicate from each sector of yours that adjoins the
victim's sector;
(thus you could attack with up to 508 military).
.s1
Troops from each type of sector normally fight with equal stamina,
however troops in fortresses fight especially hard, as do troops
defending a capital.
Defending forts at 100% efficiency
give their troops a 4-to-1 advantage over ordinary troops
and 100% efficient capitals give their troops a 2-to-1 advantage
over ordinary attacking troops.
Attacking forts give a 2-to-1 advantage over other types.
Of course this effect is degraded by lower efficiency.
.sp
Before considering an attack one should weigh the possibilities
of that sector being defended by a gun! (see "info defend")
It need not be a fort;
however attacking forts can be doubly deadly; for if the fort has a
gun and is defended by another fort, both will fire at your troops
with devastating effect.
In your favor is the fact that the defending gun can only be
fired from a fort and that fort must be within range of you.
.sp
The next big question - cost??
Attacking costs you in three ways:
.ti 3
.ne 2
B.T.U. cost
.br
(the cost of flying desks) = # of total troops killed * .15
.sp
.ti 3
.ne 2
Mobility cost
.br
(for gasoline & k-rations) depends on terrain:
.s1
.nf
.ne 8
	Mobility Cost (Per Military) in Attacks
		type of sector being attacked
attacking from	 (+)   (?)   (-)   (^)
(+) Highway	.125  .208  .291  21.3
(?) others	.167  .250  .333  21.3
(-) Wasteland	.208  .291  .375  21.4
(^) Mountain	10.7  10.8  10.9  31.9
.fi
.sp
and finally
.ti 3
Ill-will cost (distrust from peaceniks) = ???
.sp
The battle will rage until someone is wiped out
(the victim fights with all of his troops).
Each time a soldier is killed a character is typed; "!" if a defending
soldier, "@" if an attacking one and "*" if an entire attacking sector is lost.
If you lose, tough!
However, if you win, your attacking forces that survive will move into
the victim's sector.  When planning an attack remember that
overwhelming forces greatly increases your odds; i.e.
attacking 10 men with 40 will result in your losing
fewer troops than if you had attacked with 20.
.sp
A few notes:
.br
The deity (country 0) is pacifistic and unlikely to
help attackers (except in response to a large offering on sunday).
.sp
Finally, before initiating an attack you should consider whether
the real answer to your problem might be diplomacy, (you heavy-handed clod!)
