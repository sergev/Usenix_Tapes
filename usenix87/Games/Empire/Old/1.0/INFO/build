.TH Command : BUILD
.s1
The build command is used to specify the types of ships
to be built in your harbors and the directions in which bridge spans are
to be built from bridge head sectors.
Its general form is:
.EX build (sects) <type or direction>
Given sufficient labor force, time and ore each harbor or bridge head will
accumulate up to 127 production units which can be used to build ships
or bridge spans.
.s1
HARBOR EXAMPLES
.s3
If you type:
.EX build -4:2,3:16 ?des=h
You build in any harbor sectors within the -4:2,3:16 area.
The program responds:
.s1
.ti 3
37 production units in harbor at -3,14 kind of ship?
.s1
You now have your choice as to what kind of ship
to build assuming you have sufficient production units and money.
.s1
Your choices are :
.NF
Ship type	Production	Money
pt boat		30		270
minesweeper	50		450
destroyer	60		540
submarine	70		630
freighter	80		720
tender		100		900
battleship	127		1016
carrier		127		1016
.FI
.s1
Only the first letter is required to indicate your choice.
.s1
If the optional <type> argument is used the program will try to build
the specified ship type in all harbors in the given area and will not
ask you to specify ship type for each harbor.
.s1
Note that ships first appear at 50% efficiency.
As time passes they grow to 100% efficiency.
.s1
BRIDGE HEAD EXAMPLES
.s3
If you type
.EX build 2,2
and 2,2 is a bridge head, (#), the program will respond:
.ti +3
Bridge head at 2,2; build span in what direction? (udlr) d
.ti +3
Bridge span built over 2,3
.s3
Note that bridge spans require 127 production units in the bridge head
and cost about $2000 each to build.
.s1
If the optional <direction> argument is used the program will try to build
a span in the specified direction from all bridge heads in the given area
that have the necessary 127 production units.
