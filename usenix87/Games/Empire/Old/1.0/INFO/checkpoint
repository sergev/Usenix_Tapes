.TH Command : CHECKPOINT
.s1
The checkpoint command allows you to grant access privileges to
another country. Anyone knowing the checkpoint code can pass
thru the sector and/or remove anything residing in the sector.
.s3
To run this command type:
.EX checkpoint 0:3,-2:4
The program will ask for your representative name to prevent
others from changing your codes.
.s3
It will then request the code
for each sector.
The code can be any number between -128 and 127 (inclusive) but if it
is 0 the checkpoint is removed...
.s3
Census will indicate checkpoints with a * in the "code" column.
.s1
Note that whereas most sectors are closed to general access unless
they are checkpointed (and then open only to people who know the code),
highway sectors are normally open to access from
everyone (i.e. anyone can move people in and, more importantly,
out) unless they are checkpointed.
