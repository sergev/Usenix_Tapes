.TH Command : DISSOLVE
The dissolve command is the coward's way out of Empire.
It does several things: it gives all your sectors back to The Deity,
pays off any debts that it can, voids any treaties in which you were
involved, and allows your ships to decide their own fate.  Some ships
riot, some go up for sale, and some are scuttled.
.s1
Using the dissolve command is simplicity itself:
.EX dissolve
You will be asked your name (to make sure you have the authority to do it)
and then it's curtains...
