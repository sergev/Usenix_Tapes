.TH Command : EXECUTE
.s1
The execute command lets you run command files in empire.
Its general form is:
.EX execute file
where "file" is the name of the file containing (empire) commands.
For instance, if you had a file called "empdaily" which looked like:
.NF

update >grunch
news >>grunch
map # >>grunch
census # >>grunch
ship >>grunch

.FI
and then you logged in to Empire and said:
.EX execute empdaily
the program would perform an update, read the news,
make a map, output a census,
list the status of each of your ships into the file "grunch"
and then prompt you for further commands.
.sp
Beware however, if your file says "bye" you will be logged off!
