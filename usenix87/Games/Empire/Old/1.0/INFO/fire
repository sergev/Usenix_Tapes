.TH Command : FIRE
.s1
The fire command is used to shoot up land sectors or ships.
The general form for shooting at land is:
.EX fire (sect)
Where (sect) is the sector AT which you are shooting,
(NOT the sector FROM which you are shooting).
.s1
The general form for firing at ships is:
.EX fire (ship)
Again, (ship) is the victim ship number.
.s1
The program will then ask for the sector or ship FROM which you are firing.

The only sector that may fire is a fortress which must have at least
5 military for a firing crew, at least 1 shell to fire, and a gun big
enough to reach the victim location; range is equal to the "number"
of guns (with a maximum of 7)
times the technology factor (which has a maximum of 1. see "info technology").
.s1
Any ship other than a freighter may fire as long as it has
at least one gun,
at least one shell,
and has at least 60% efficiency.
If the ship can fire more than one gun the program will ask how many
you wish to fire.
See info "ship-types" for gun ranges.

The program then prints a satisfying "Kaboom!!!" and,
assuming you were in range, inflicts damage.
.s1
The damages inflicted vary with efficiency of the attacker,
the size of the guns (battleship guns are four times as big as
pt boat guns), the number of guns fired, etc.
.s1
A table of approximate damages looks like:
.NF +5
From	To	Range of dmages
land	land	11% .. 16%
land	sea	14% .. 49%
pt *	land	7%
pt *    sea     9%  .. 28%
bat **	land	25%
bat **	sea	30% .. 64%
.FI
* pt here is the example of the wimpiest sea gun while
.br
** bat means a battleship firing four guns at once.

An illustrative example of shelling land:

Firing on sector 34,18 from 35,18
Kaboom!!!

Meanwhile, the owner of sector 35,18 might be logged on and would
perhaps see the following:

.FI
Note that the shell did about 13% damage in the sector.

If the sector fired on is a fort with guns and shells it will fire back
with approximately the same damages (assuming it has the range).
If a ship fired on has guns and shells it will fire back AND
any other ships of the same nationality that are in range will also
fire on you.
