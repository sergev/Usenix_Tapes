.TH Command : FLEETADD
.s1
The fleetadd command is used to specify the fleet groupings of your ships.
The general form is:
.EX fleetadd (fleet) (ships/fleet)
where (fleet) is the alphabetic character to be used as the fleet designation,
upper or lower case a-z and `~'.  The pseudo-fleet specification `~'
specifies all ships not currently in any fleet.
.s1
.NF
The specification of ships, (ships/fleet), can have one of several syntaxes:
.s3
ex          meaning
--          -------
23          ship 23
2/14/23     ships 2, 14, and 23
c           all ships currently in fleet `c'
~           all ships currently in the "null" fleet
2,3         all ships in sector 2,3
-1:3,0:2    all ships in the area bounded by -1 & 3 (EW) and 0 & 2 (NS)
.FI
All fleets, (with the exception of the `~' fleet), are limited to
some maximum size and you will be informed how many ships can be
added when this command is run.

Having ships organized into fleets can be very helpful in
loading, moving, etc. in that fewer commands are required to
perform these commands on groups of ships if they can be
specified by fleet number.

Note that you can remove ships from a fleet by adding them to
the `~' fleet.  e.g.
.EX fleetadd ~ A
This command would purge all ships from fleet `A'.
