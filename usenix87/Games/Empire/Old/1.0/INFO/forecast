.TH Command : FORECAST
.s1
The forecast command is used to predict the weather around a
weather station. It requires one civilian for each hour in the future
you wish to peruse. The range of the prediction depends on its efficiency.
Thus a 100% weather station can predict up to 7 sectors away.
To run this command type:
.EX forecast (sects)
The program will request the location of the weather station and
list the location of the high and low at the hour you requested
and then one hour later. Thus you can plot the motion of the 
weather centers.. It will also give you a map of the area as it will
appear in that future hour...
