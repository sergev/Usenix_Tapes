.TH Command : LOAD
.s1
The load command enables the loading of ships.
To run type:
.EX load (ship) (percent)
where (ship) is the ship number. The ship must be in a harbor.
If the harbor is not yours but has been checkpointed you may
still load from it if you know the checkpoint code.
The optional percent argument indicates that you wish to load
the the specified percentage of the maximum amount possible of
each commodity.
If you do not use the percent argument
the program will interactively ask you how many of each item to load.

The maximum each ship can hold is:
.NF +1
