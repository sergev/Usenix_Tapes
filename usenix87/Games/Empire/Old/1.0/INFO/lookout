.TH Command : LOOKOUT
.s1
The lookout command allows ships to report sightings of other ships
and land sectors and allows coastal sectors to report sightings of ships.
The general form is:
.EX lookout (ship/fleet/sect)
The various ranges over which lookout is effective break down into
three groups:
.br
.ti 3
ship to ship
.br
This range is dependent on both the visibility of the ship
being observed and the visual range of the observing ship.
(see "info ship-types")
Destroyers seeing Submarines is a special case; if the sub
is out of "regular" visual range (i.e. not in the same sector)
but within 3 or so of the destroyer the message "Snorkel at X,Y"
is printed.
.ti 3
ship to land
.br
This range is either 1.4 in good weather (barometer > 700.)
or 1. in bad weather (barometer < 700.).
.ti 3
land to ship
.br
In good weather this range is essentially equal to twice the sector efficiency
expressed as a decimal; e.g. 100% can see 2 sectors away.
The exception is radar installations which have a range approximately
equal to seven times the sector efficiency.
