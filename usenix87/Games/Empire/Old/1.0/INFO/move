.TH Command : MOVE
The move command is crucial to Empire; it facillitates the movement
of civilians, military, ore, guns, shells, planes, and gold bars.
To run it type:
.EX move ITEM
where ITEM is one of:
.NF
c       civilians
m       military
o       ore
g       guns
s       shells
p       planes
b       bars of gold
.FI
.s1
The program will request the starting sector then display
the number of mobility units in that sector and its
coordinates in the form:
.s1
.ti 3
<97.0: -6,4>
.s3
which indicates 97 mobility units and sector -6,4.
You may respond with any combination of:
.s1
.NF
u  for up
d  for down                \\\\l    u     /r
r  for right
l  for left                     \\\\|/
\\\\l for up-left             l  --   --  r
/r for up-right                 /|\\\\
/l for down-left
\\\\r for down-right          /l    d     \\\\r
v  for view
e  for end of movement
.FI

Typical mobility costs are:
.s1
.NF
1 mu per 5 civilians
1 mu per 5 military
1 mu per 5 tons of ore
2 mu per gun
2 mu per 5 shells
4 mu per plane
10 mu per bar of gold
.FI
.s1
These costs are for an orthogonal move, (u, d, l or r), through a
100% efficient "regular" sector in "good" weather;
diagonal moves cost 1.414 times as much,
wastelands cost twice as much, mountains cost lots more & highways can
cost as little as nothing (if 100% efficient).
.s1
If you wish you may give all or part of the information for a move on the
command line:
.EX move c -3,0 20 rrre
This command will try to move 20 civilians from -3,0 to your capital, (0,0).
