.TH Command : POWER
.s1
The power report will give you an accurate picture of world
strengths. It is particularly worthwhile in planning
defense strategies and treaty voting.

A power report is obtained by typing:
.EX power
If someone has generated a power report within the last hour, you will
be graced with an immediate output of that information. Otherwise
it will take 1-2 minutes to obtain the report.

Output consists of the following information :
.NF +3
a	# of sectors
b	# of civilians
c	# of military
d	# of guns
e	# of shells
f	# of planes
g	average sector efficiency
h	# gold bars
i	# of ships
ii	tons of ships (not displayed)
j	# of dollars
k	power - a measure of military/industrial capability
.FI

k is determined by the following relation:

k = (a*g+d)/3 + (b+c+e+ii)/10 + j/100 + f + i + 5*h
