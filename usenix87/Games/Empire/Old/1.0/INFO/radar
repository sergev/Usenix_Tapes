.TH Command : RADAR
.s1
The radar command bears every resemblance to modern high-resolution
radar.  It has a circular range dependent upon its efficiency.

To run land radar type:
.EX radar (sect)
where (sect) must be the sector where the radar station resides.

The program will respond with the station's efficiency and range
and then display the area.
What is displayed is dependent upon the range, i.e.
sectors and ships within 1/2 of its range
are displayed with their sector or ship designations.
At further distances a '?' is used to indicate the presence
of another pilgrim not of your faith.

A 100% radar station has a range of 6.1.
The range is linearly related to efficiency so a 25% radar
can see 1.525 sectors away.

!!WARNING!! Radar cannot spot submarines. Even worse, should you
possess a cunning enemy he might move troops right to your
doorstop leaving the sector designated a wilderness which would
show up on your very efficient radar as '-'. Thus you would
never know he was there....well almost never. If you worry
about this try taking a map -- he can't hide there!

To run naval radar type:
.EX radar (ship)
where (ship) is the number of the ship..
The sea radar is highly dependent upon what kind of ship you
have and what kind the opponent has...
e.g. Battleships can see battleships far away but not pt boats..
Battleships have a 100% range of 6 while p.t. boats, destroyers
and carriers have a range of 4 and all other ships see only 3.
On the other hand, the ships vary in size and consequently,
vary in visibility: battleships and carriers are the easiest to see
(25), next come freighters, minesweeps and tenders (20) followed by
destroyers (15), pt boats (10) and lastly, submarines (2).

Note that although subs can not be found via radar that
destroyers automatically use sonar too so they will see subs up to
2.86 sectors away..
