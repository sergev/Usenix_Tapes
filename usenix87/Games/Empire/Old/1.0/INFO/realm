.TH Command : REALM
.s1
The realm command allows you to manipulate the contents of the
four "realm"s associated with your country
which provide a convenient way to save coordinates that are
frequently used, (see "info syntax" for use of realm arguments).
The general form of the realm command is:
.EX realm (number) <(sects)>
(Number) is the number of the realm to be set and must be in the range 0:3.
Note that the update command manipulates realm 0 (see "info update").
.s1
The (sects) argument is optional; if included the specified realm will be
set to (sects), if ommitted the coordinates of the specified realm will
be printed.  e.g.
.sp
.NF +3
.EX realm 1 -3:2,4
.EX realm 1
Realm 1 is -3:2,4:4
.FI
.s1
Also note that "#"-type arguments may be used in the (sects) argument.
.EX realm 0 #1
Now realm 0 is set to -3:2,4:4.
.sp
The nation report includes the coordinates of all four realms.
