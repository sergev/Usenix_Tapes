.TH Concept : RESEARCH
.sp
The research level of an Empire country is determined
by the output of research sectors in the following way.
Whenever a research sector is updated and there are 25 or more
units of production they are turned into "medical discoveries";
for each 25 units of production the research level of the country is
raised by 1.
The research level decays away however with time,
(the diseases get smarter) at a rate of 1% per day (48 time units).
Therefore if a country has 5 research labs each of which is able
to produce 40 units of production a day the total daily production
of medical discoveries will be 200 / 25 ( = 8) and the
research level of the country will approach 800, where the 1%
daily loss exactly equals the daily gain of 8.
