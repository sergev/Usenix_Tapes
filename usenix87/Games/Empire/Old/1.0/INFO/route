.TH Command : ROUTE
.s1
The route command generates a graphic display of the delivery specifications
for the various deliverable items in a given sector area.
The general form of the command is:
.EX route (item) (sects)
(sects) is as described in "info syntax" and (item) is one of the following:
.NF +3
s	shells
g	guns (not gold)
p	planes
o	ore
b	bars of gold
.FI

The delivery routes are indicated with "go-to's" (as opposed to "come-from's")
using the following codes (assuming sector in question is a mine):
.NF +3
.in 3
.sp
^m^	up	 	(0 in census)
 m/	up-right	(1 in census)
 m>	right		(2 in census)
