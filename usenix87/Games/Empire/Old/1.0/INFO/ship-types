.TH Empire Ship Types
.s1
	At present there are 8 different ship types:
.s1
	pt boat		submarine	battleship
	destroyer	freighter	minesweep
	tender		carrier
.s1
These ship types differ in their fundamental
capabilities; some can carry (and fire) two guns,
the sizes of the guns differ on all of them;
freighters can carry 127 guns but can't fire them;
etc.  The following table contains all these parameters:

.lp +8 4
	cost is the number of production units required to build it
.lp +8 4
	sp is the distance/mu for moving in relative units
.lp +8 4
	vis is how visible the ship is
.lp +8 4
	rng is twice the distance the guns can fire (assuming a very high technology level)
.lp +8 4
	civ, mil, sh, gun, ore & gold are the amounts of civilians,
military, shells, guns, ore & gold the ships can carry
.lp +8 4
	vrng is how far the ship can see (i.e. how good the
communication equipment is) again in relative units
