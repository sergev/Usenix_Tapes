.TH Command : SPY
.s1
The spy command allows reconnaisance operations to enforce
an oral treaty or as preparation for an attack
(or even for a prayer to the Deity).
The spy report will reveal (in round figures) the numbers of troops,
civilians, guns, shells, and the sector designation and efficiency
in neighboring sectors.

To perform this type of research type:
.EX spy (sects)
The sectors denoted by "(sects)"
are those from which you are spying,
(see "info syntax" for format).

Note that the number of BTUs consumed is dependent upon the number
of sectors into which you spy, e.g. A 5x8 area costs one full BTU.

Warning!! If you are spying on an unallied country
your spy could be apprehended... his/her chances are dependent upon the number
of patrolling military in the sector.
If the other country has declared itself at war with you the spy
will be shot and the other country (and the rest of the world,
through the news) will be warned that you tried to spy on him...
If the other country is neutral towards you the spy will be deported.
