.TH Concept : TECHNOLOGY
.sp
The technological level of an Empire country is determined
by the output of technology sectors in the following way.
Whenever a technology sector is updated and there are 25 or more
units of production they are turned into "technological breakthroughs";
for each 25 units of production the technology level of the country is
raised by 1.  The technology level decays away however with time,
(the technology becomes passe) at a rate of 1% per day (48 time units).
Therefore if a country has 5 technology centers each of which is able
to produce 40 units of production a day the total daily production
of technological breakthroughs will be 200 / 25 ( = 8) and the
technology level of the country will approach 800, where the 1%
daily loss exactly equals the daily gain of 8.

The technological level affects the range that guns can fire,
the range over which radar is effective,
the range that planes can fly
and the range that
torpedoes can travel.
The "nation" command will display, among other things, your current
technology level.
