.TH Command : TELEGRAM
.s1
The telegram command allows non-treaty communication
to take place between representatives.  Currently you
are given only 512 characters per telegram, so telegrams
encourage succinct diplomacy.
.s3
The general form is:
.EX telegram (cno/cname)
where (cno/cname) is either the number or name of
the recipient nation.
Telegrams sent to country #0 appear as prayers,
(favors are best obtained in this manner.)
.s1
While entering your telegram you may use ^U to delete the current line,
<DEL> (or <RUBOUT>) to delete the previous character,
(including <LF>s)
and ^R to print the number of characters left
and re-type the telegram so far.
For example:
.NF 3
.EX tel 7
Enter telegram for Groonland; end with ^D

Dear Ambassador Pouncetrifle,

Just a little note to express the friendly wishes that all of us
in Curmudgeon feel toward you backward savages in Groonland.  As
to the matter of the treaty you've proposed please remember that
if we wished we could TRASH your capital.

An alternate form of the telegram command allows you to send a telegram
from a file. It is:
.EX telegram (cno/cname) (file)
which sends the file to the specified country.
For example:
.EX telegram Groonland threat
would send the file "threat" to Groonland.
