.TH Concept : TIME
.s1
Because of the unique nature of Empire governments
(i.e. the decision makers spend most of their time on vacation)
and the fact that ideally the Empire "environment" will
mirror the "real" world,
various heuristics dealing with time have been implemented.
.s1
The first is the Bureaucratic Time Unit (BTU) concept which
keeps track of the potential for doing "work" posessed by
your government.
.s1
The second heuristic (i.e. hack) is the Elapsed Time Limit which
limits the amount of time that players may be logged on
each day.  The ETL is not cumulative and is reset to
a value X (defined when the game is built and installed), typically
somewhere between 30 minutes and two hours, every night at midnight.
.s1
The ETL and BTU counts are displayed with each command prompt
as follows:
