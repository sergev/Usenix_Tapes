.TH Command : UPDATE
.s1
The update command causes all your sectors to be brought up to date
in terms of digging up ore, building efficiency, generating mobility
units, etc.
It also defines the coordinates associated with"realm 0" ("#" or "#0").

The general form is:
.EX update
or
.EX update (sects)
In the first example the entire world would be scanned for sectors
of yours that need updating, and realm 0 ("#") would be set to
include all of your sectors.  In the second case only the area
specified would be scanned and "#" would be set to encompass all
sectors of yours in that area.
.s1
For example:
.NF +3
[37:105] Command : update -1:1,-1:1
Production bottleneck in 0,-1
guns built in 0,1
Your "realm 0"(#0) is -1:1,-1:1 and consists of 7 sectors.

[37:105] Command : update
Your "realm 0"(#0) is -3:1,-1:1 and consists of 9 sectors.
.FI
Note that the first time through only the sectors in the area specified
were counted and that some of them produced messages when they were
updated, while the second time through caught all the sectors, (and took
2 minutes) but the middle sectors had already been updated so they did not
produce further messages.
.s3

An additional argument to update allows you to control the printing
of the update messages.  If the argument "quiet" is specified,
(e.g. "update 12:15,-3:4 quiet"),
NO update messages will be printed except the "realm" message and certain
emergency messages.
If, on the other hand "verbose" is specified not only will
the standard messages be printed but also messages describing
attempts to deliver blivets to sectors that are already full of
blivets will be printed.
