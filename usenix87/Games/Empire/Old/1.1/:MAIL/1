Version 1.1 Old Empire (Empire Classic ?) source (!!) is ready for
distribution.  In my article in late June, I promised that if there were enough
bugs reported (and I had the time to fix them !) there would be another release
ready about now.  So....  For the uninitiated, here are a few excerpts from the
original article. 

> Old Empire is a version of Peter Langston's empire game as it looked around
> 1980.  The source for this version was obtained by decompiling the optimized
> PDP-11/70 object code. 

> The empire source is about 11K lines of C.  The output from the decompiler is
> ugly and shouldn't be discussed in front of young kids.  There are zillion
> goto statements where you would normally find 'for' and 'while' loops (I
> straightened a few things out when doing the final editing of the decompiler
> output, but there are still a lot of goto's).  There might be a few
> "original" bugs left, but I know there are an equal number introduced by the
> decompilation and triple porting operations. 

> This version has the rectangular grid, unimplemented agribusiness, no nukes,
> and only the original 7 ship types (batt, carr, dest, sub, tend, pt, and
> freight).  No new bells or whistles have been added.  In fact, every effort
> was made to restore the game to its original condition, but with bugs
> exterminated. 

> The distribution comes with Buglist and README files.  I can post the Buglist
> to the net if people want to see it.  It runs on a 5.0 VAX, 5.2 Amdahl UTS,
> and 5.2.2 3b [and now 4.2BSD].  The makefiles aren't the greatest, but I find
> them useful. 

> Please direct all Old Empire flames and bug reports to me.  I'll respond to
> bug reports as I find time.

Version 1.1 has the following improvements over Version 1.0:

 1) It uses buffered I/O - faster

 2) torp command gets mobility right, doesn't allow torp'ing from subs you
    don't own, doesn't allow torp'ing sunken ships.

 3) only tenders can tend

 4) only capitals you own can build BTUs (in Version 1.0 an unowned fort at 0,0
    will do the trick!)

 5) The shell command accepts more than one command

 6) The shell command works!

 7) redirection and piping work

 8) dependencies on fcntl.h, time.h, termio.h are fixed so that it is more
    compatible with 4.2BSD.

 9) A new sread function for 4.2BSD

10) calls to rand() are fixed so that they will work regardless of 16 or 32-bit
    results. (Random() is better on 4.2, but it isn't available on SysV).

11) checkpoints are cleared on collection

12) makefiles for SysV are better.  Unless I can fix them up before shipping,
    they're worse for 4.2 BSD.

13) ... and 11 other miscellaneous bug fixes.

Many thanks to davee at hp and mjs at eagle for the reports and psl for the
consultation.  You can get the whole release by sending a tape (600' will do)
to the above address.
