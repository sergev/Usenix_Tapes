        ==[  Instructions for installing Old Empire  ]==

1) Create EMPGLB/empglb.c from the sysglb.c provided.  It is usually
   a good idea to create a local version first ( edit myglb.c and
   link it to empglb.c ) to try out the installation procedure and
   verify system compatibility.  
   Also set privuid and privname to whatever suits you.  Set the
   maximum number of countries and time limit to appropriate values
   for your player community.  Defaults are 32 countries and 30
   minutes.  Note - if you try to set up a world other than 64x64,
   it might not work.  Someone will get clever and fix this some day.

2) After establishing empglb.c, and if you are on a 4.2BSD system,
   change empdef.h to uncomment the #define BSD.  For SysV, nothing
   has to be changed.  Also, for 4.2BSD systems, you might want to
   use the 4.2mkfile in EMPSUBS, EMPFIX, and COMMANDS instead of the
   Makefiles provided.

3) On SysV, do: make all
   You might want to build the system with the optimizer (-O option).
   If you want to compile with -O (or -g for debugging), set 
   CFLAGS="-O"; export CFLAGS; make -e all.

   If you have a 3b2, to avoid core dumps on floating point operations,
   set CC="cc -f", then export CC, then make -e all.

4) The binaries, empcre and empire, are installed in the top level
   directory, and the emp[123457] and empfix modules are installed in BIN.

5) If the system version (/usr/games/empfiles) version of empglb.c is
   used, create the appropriate directories /usr/games/empfiles/BIN,
   and /usr/games/empfiles/DATA. Install the BIN/* modules in the BIN
   directory and the empire command in /usr/games. Change the ownership of
   the files to games. Change the ownership of the empire command to games
   and turn the setuid bit on.  Execute the empcre command, setuid to
   games to create the DATA/* files.  I usually use the -t (trace) option
   of empcre to see what kind of land masses, waterways, etc. are
   created.  My personal preference is to avoid landlocked, large lakes -
   but large islands can be interesting.

6) Log in as the Deity (established with empcre) and use the "add" command
   to add countries.  I usually add Visitor as country #1, and give it
   visitor status (sometimes the name is "Observer").  This allows gentler
   souls to observe the violence at a safe distance, and allows the
   megalomaniacs to check on the damage to their country without using any
   time or BTUs.

7) The file, Buglist, contains all known bugs fixed and remaining in
   this version.  The "version" command identifies this version of Old Empire.
   Read the Buglist file!
   If there are other *Buglist files present, they are the Buglist files
   that were associated with previous versions.  Read them to see what
   you're missing.
