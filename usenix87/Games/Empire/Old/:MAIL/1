In response to all the inquiries about empire..

Version 1.2 Old Empire (Empire Classic ?) source (!!) is ready for
distribution.  There are a lot of empire versions out there.  This
one is described in my original article:

> Old Empire is a version of Peter Langston's empire game as it looked
> around 1980.  The source for this version was obtained by
> decompiling the optimized PDP-11/70 object code.
> 
> The empire source is about 11K lines of C.  The output from the
> decompiler is ugly and shouldn't be discussed in front of young kids.
> There are zillion goto statements where you would normally find
> 'for' and 'while' loops (I straightened a few things out when doing
> the final editing of the decompiler output, but there are still a lot
> of goto's).
> 
> This version has the rectangular grid, unimplemented agribusiness, no
> nukes, and only the original 7 ship types (batt, carr, dest, sub, tend,
> pt, and freight).  No new bells or whistles have been added.  In fact,
> every effort was made to restore the game to its original condition,
> but with bugs exterminated.
> 
> The distribution comes with Buglist and README files.  I can post the
> Buglist to the net if people want to see it.  It runs on a 5.0 VAX,
> 5.2 Amdahl UTS, and 5.2.2 3b [and now 4.2BSD].

Version 1.2 has the following improvements over Version 1.1:
1) The infamous "rolling civilians" bug is fixed!  This will make it harder
   for the experienced meanies to tromp all over the neophytes in the
   beginning of the game.
2) Negative production is fixed.
3) A 128*128 world is created OK.
4) Several fixes for the 3b2.
5) Makefile improvements.
6) Misc. fixes in INFO directory.
7) Crash landings inflict damage intended.
8) Empfix handles loans correctly.
9) Mobility can be used as a condition (doesn't work in 1.1).
10) Buying a ship from the Deity and boarding a ship owned by the Deity
    is fixed.
11) Making gold ore out of ordinary ore is fixed.
12) The route command shows civ and mil routes through an exchange.
13) Miscellaneous little stuff.

Things not fixed yet:
1) Signals
2) Two terminal login on same country.  This is easy to fix for a specific
   system, but harder to do in a general way.  The "fix" can also cause
   problems for folks that get bounced out of the game by a signal.  If
   the signal handling isn't done right, they can get locked out of the
   game.
3) Code straightening.
4) Miscellaneous stuff.  No game spoilers that I know of.

If you want this fine antique, send a tape (200' will do) in a reusable
mailer (padded Jiffy, Dennison, Jet-pak, etc.), and sufficient return
postage ($2.50 covers a 600' reel sent 1st class in a padded
mailer) to:

	Tom Fisher
	AT&T-ISL Room 31H59
	11900 N. Pecos St.
	Denver, CO 80234

Also include return address, and your choice of 1600 or 6250bpi, and
tar or cpio format.
