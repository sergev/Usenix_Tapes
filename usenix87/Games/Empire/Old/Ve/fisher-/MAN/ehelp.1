ehelp - an Old Empire playing aid			Version 1.0  12/85

There are three programs designed (hacked together) to reduce the
empire playing time, while maximizing the enjoyment of interacting
with the other players.  The program captures data from Old Empire
output (e.g. census, ship, radar, ...), and uses a screen oriented
user interface to display the accumulated knowledge of the world.
The user uses the display to create a empire command script which
can be executed with the "ex" command.  In this way, delivery routes
can be established, goods can be moved, ships can be navigated, etc.

The four programs are:   ecre, ehelp, and eupd.

They are used in the following sequence:

  COMMAND			WHAT TO DO WITH IT
1. ecre	[-x new_capx] [-y new_capy]
		Invoked without arguments, it creates an empty world
		in a file called, "newsect".
		Create a file "newsect".  Rename it "empsect" after
		optionally saving the old world.  Also create an empty
		file called "empship" ( >empship). 
		Invoked with arguments, this command can be used to change 
		the location of your capital.  In fact, if you don't use
		this program to reflect a new capital location, your view
		of the world will get all hosed up. If you designate 1,3
		as a new capital, use  ecre -x 1 -y 3 to create a "newsect"
		having the appropriate adjustments.

2. play empire, saving the output in a file 
	(e.g. empire Cname rep | tee outfile)
	Optionally use scripts generated in step 4.

3. eupd < outfile
		Update your view of the world.  This updates
		empsect and empship. I don't think eupd handles
		"route" command output very gracefully, so don't use "route".
		 Use "census" and ehelp instead.
   eupd -p
		Suppose your neighbor has taken over most of your western
		border while you were on a trip to New Jersey.  The updater
		isn't smart enough to read through the telegrams and find out
		what you no longer own.  This can be handled by issuing:

			eupd -p

		This purges the world of all sectors owned by you.  To get the
		sectors assigned to you again, simply do a cen # (the whole
		world) and run the output through the eupd command.  The
		sectors you no longer own will be missing in the census output,
		and therefore they will remain unowned on your map.  Of course,
		the best strategy of all is never take a trip to New Jersey.

4. ehelp	Enter the screen oriented display, and create the
		desired command scripts.  These scripts are written in a
		file called .yout .
		Now erase outfile, and go back to step 2.

Use ehelp like this:

While in ehelp, the cursor is either on the map or down in the lower left
corner waiting for command input.  Furthermore, ehelp is either set up for
a specified empire command or it's waiting for you to specify a command
(or possibly map coordinates).

When your prompt is ">" in the lower left corner, you haven't specified
a command yet.  In this mode, the following is legal:

Enter:
	x,y		change center coordinates
	map		display map
	cen		set up for census commands
	mov		set up for move commands
	del		set up for delivery commands
	des		set up for designate commands
	shi		set up for ship commands
	nav		set up for navigate commands
	>command	append the string following the ">" to .yout
	crtl-d		exit ehelp

When you set up any of the command modes (cen, des, etc.) your prompt
will change, and the information block in the upper right will change.

For commands like mov, del, des, you change the quantity, designation,
resource, threshold, etc. by entering the number or letter while the
cursor is in the lower left corner, next to the prompt.
For example, after entering des, the cursor will still be in the lower
left corner.  Note that the default designation in the information block
in the upper right is 'g'.  Type d to change the designation to a defense
plant, for example.

To leave the specified command mode, type '.' or ctrl-d when the cursor
is in the corner.

After entering the number or letter, the cursor will go up to the
map.  To bring the cursor back to the corner, hit the return key.
When the cursor is in the corner, put it on the map by hitting the
return key.

Once on the map, move around by using the 
		  w  e  r                 k
		   \ | /                  |
		  s - - d      or      h - - l
		   / | \                  |
		  z  x  c                 j

keys.  When positioned over a sector, hit the tab (ctrl-i) to see
what's in that sector.  If you're in ship or nav mode, hit 'I' and
'i' to see other useful info.

Nothing gets written to the script file (.yout) unless you're on the
map and you hit the space bar, or you use the ">command" feature
shown above.

Specific commands:

When the prompt is ">", type "map" to get a map drawn on the screen.
The display is centered around the coordinates chosen (default is 0,0).
It might look like this:
	 .  -  .  m 
	 f  h  m  ^?
	 .  *  f  f  d  ?
	 m  i  m  u  ?  ? 

Question marks indicate sectors you don't own.  Sometimes the designation
is shown just to the left of the '?'.  In the display above, the mountain
was detected by a map or spy command, and the fact that it's owned by
someone else was probably obtained from a spy command.  The other '?'s
were probably the result of a map command.

To get a census command appended to .yout, enter cen mode and postition
the cursor on the sector you want a census of.  Then hit the space bar.

To designate sectors, enter des mode and select a designation.
Position the cursor on the victim sector, and hit the space bar.
A "des" command will be appended to .yout.

To establish a delivery route, enter del mode.  Select resource
and threshold.  Note that the screen will be redrawn showing the 
existing routes for the selected resource.
When in del mode, position the cursor on the supplying
sector, then type a '+'.  Next, position the cursor on the adjacent
receiving sector, and hit the space bar.  A "del" command will be
appended to .yout, and the receiving sector is automatically marked
as the next supplying sector.  Move the cursor to the next receiving
sector, and hit the space bar again.  To indicate a new supplying
sector at any time, position the cursor, then type '+'.  Your route is
shown as you construct it on the map, but remember that no changes are
made to the empire world until you run the script.  In fact, your
local database isn't changed either.  It will change when you run the
output of the empire session (with appropriate census output) through eupd.

To move things around, enter mov mode.  Select resource and quantity.
Position cursor on the supplying sector, then type a '+'.  Move
the cursor to the next sector in the route to the destination and
type another '+'.  Continue in this way until the cursor is positioned
on the destination sector.  Instead of typing '+', hit the space bar.
A "mov" command will be appended to .yout.  The route will be indicated
with '@' characters.  To tear down the route completely or partially,
type a '-'.
Ships are navigated the same way, except you enter nav mode, and
select a ship number, group of ships (124/35/245), or all ships
in the starting sector (type a ',' instead of ship number).  Hit
the space bar to append a "nav" command to .yout .

To find out where all the ships are, enter ship mode.  You can limit
the operation to ships of only certain types by entering a string
next to the prompt.  For example, to limit operations to carriers
and battleships, type "cb".  To reinstate the full list again, type
"*".  To get a display of all the ships known to you, type "?".
Your ships will be to the right of the sector, and other country
ships will be positioned to the left.  Ships are shown as capital letters.
For example your harbor with a pt boat in it and someone else's battleship
just to the north would look like this:
	 .  .  .  . 
	 m B.  .  f
	 f  hP *  m
	 ^  f  m  u

All the ships in a particular sector "stack" up, and only the ship with the
highest number is shown.  If there were 30 ships in your harbor above, and
several other countries had parked ships just to the north, the display
would look the same so long as the battleship and pt boat had the highest
ship number in that sector.  Watch out for capital letters to the left
of your harbors...

There is a way to limit the other country display to just a particular 
country, perhaps an enemy of particular interest.  Before invoking
ehelp, set the shell variable FOES to the country number of interest.
e.g.  FOES=4
      export FOES
Then invoke ehelp.  The numbers next to the sectors are the ones-digits
of the owning country number (11 and 1 will look alike), and ship displays
will be limited to just your ships and ships owned by the country number
FOES was set to.

Note that you can change your database (empsect and empship) just by
faking empire output and running it through eupd.  For example, suppose
your ship hits a mine.  You could have a shell script named "mine" that
takes the x,y coordinate of the mined sector and produces a fake
census command output having zero values for everything except the shells.
One effect of this is to change the '.' on the map to a ':' when that
sector is displayed.  Hopefully you can avoid that sector when doing a "nav".
To get rid of the ':', fake a census command that has shells=0.
Another example is when ships sink (gasp!).  You can fake a ship
command output and set the efficiency to zero.  This way, the ship won't
be displayed.

You can also hose up your database pretty badly if you don't know what
you're doing with all these fake commands.

One last trick.  Suppose you want to set up delivery routes for ore, shells
and guns all in one shot without having to wait for the screen to redraw
at 1200 baud.  The trick is to change the resource with the mov command
instead of with the del command.  Enter del, and select o as the resource.
The screen redraws showing the ore delivery routes.  Get on the map and
set up your new ore routes.  Then hit a return.  That puts you back at
the prompt.  Instead of selecting another resource (which would cause the
map to be redrawn), leave the del mode by entering a '.' or ctrl-d.
Now enter mov mode.  Change the resource to s (shells).  Leave mov mode,
and re-enter del mode.  Without entering a resource, hit the return key
to get on the map.  Now set up your shell delivery routes.  Go on to do
the gun routes the same way.  Not pretty, but it works.

While you're still getting familiar with ehelp, be sure to check your
scripts.  Make sure they're what you intended.  Otherwise you could end
up doing something you didn't want to do.  Also, if you suspect that the
map isn't being drawn in the right place on the screen (bad termcap, flaky
terminal, noisy line, program bugs(gasp!)), redraw the screen before
creating another line of script.  Otherwise, the coordinates of the script
commands will be wrong.
