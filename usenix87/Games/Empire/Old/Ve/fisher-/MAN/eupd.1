eupd - an Old Empire playing aid			Version 1.0  12/85

Eupd is used to extract information from Old Empire output and update
your local sector and ship databases (empsect and empship).  Version 1.0
eupd extracts information from the following command outputs:

census		map		ship		navigate	look
radar		deliver		spy		fly

For the navigate command, only the "ship #nn stopped at x,y" message
is extracted, and the coordinates of your ships is updated.  The mobility
is left unchanged.

For the look command, in addition to the land and ship information extracted,
a message is printed when a sub is detected.  The sub's presence is not
written into the empship file.  It is assumed that you'll want to go take
a closer "look" to get the sub's number and country info.

The output of delivery commands of the following form:
	del o #1 -
is parsed for the threshold information.  The delivery direction is
gotten from the cesus command.

For the spy command, all the normal info is parsed, but when the spy
is shot, no info is extracted.  When the spy is deported, the sector that
deported the spy is checked to see if you own it.  That is, your local
database is checked to see if you think you still own that sector.  If
your database indicates (falsely) that you still own that sector, the
owner of the sector is changed to 98 (unknown).

There is a way to gather reconnaissance data from planes.  Fly over a sector
of unknown designation.  Then do a 'v' to view the sector.  This has to be
done in a particular manner.  For example, suppose you suspect your
neighbor's capital is somewhere around 3 to 4 sectors to the east of
one of your airfields.  You could find out like this:
	fly 24,-10 1 0
	<24.2:1:0:24,-10> rrr
	<21.2:1:0:27,-10> v
	Now over completely constructed technical center.
	<20.2:1:0:27,-10> d
	<19.2:1:0:27,-9> v
	Now over completely constructed capital.
	<18.2:1:0:27,-9> \llle
	1 plane landed.

Always put the 'v' on a separate line by itself.  Otherwise eupd
will update the wrong sectors.
