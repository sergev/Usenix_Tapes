There have been several requests for ve so here is an updated version of
ve done here at the UT.  This version will process ship, radar and 
coastwatch reports as well as the previous map, census, commodity and spy
reports.  Surveys have been fixed so they don't overflow.  Checkpointed
sectors are reported.  Large maps no longer cause segment violations and
other problems.  You no longer are able to run into the edge of the world.
The world map will wrap back on itself.  This version also uses much less
memory making forking the editor much faster.  The editor commands now use
the VISUAL and EDITOR environment variables.  You may now fork a shell
with the ! command (uses the SHELL environment variable).  More commodity,
census, etc. files may be read in without having to enter them on the
command line.  A Naval mode has been added to display navies and ship
information.  Tracing of routes for mov and nav commands may be shown
on the screen using ^P.

Be sure to strip the trailer.
