               Hello everybody!!!

    Since I posted the news about the GALAXY game, I received 
about 30 requests to post the sources. I don't know if that 
number is considered big or not, but it was more than I could 
handle by private communication.

So here it is. I have packed it all in 10 files, to be sent one
after the other. There are few things that require special attention

1. The files are all expanded (no tabs). The Makefiles within the
   sources should be unexpanded in order to function.
2. The game runs on 780 with 4.1 BSD but was tested with 4.2 with no
   apparent problems. It seems to me a little too big for 64K
   machines, but I didn't check that out.
3. I am eagerly waiting for reactions. This point is mentioned in
   almost any conceivable point.
4. If the game will stir interest, and players would like to comment
   about it to other players, may be another news group should be
   formed.
5. Please take note of the conditions for installation in
   "install_howto".

This is file #1 out of 10. It contains files with installation remarks
and the manual page.
