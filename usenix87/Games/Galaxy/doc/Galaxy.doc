Galactical War \- a new fascinating game for two players.
.AU
Mrdch and Amnnon
.AB
You were a mighty king of a splendid galaxy, reigning your kingdom
in peace and abundance for hundreds of years.
It all ended suddenly
(and sadly) when
cruel and powerful villains invaded your galaxy. You made a
hasty retreat, managing to rescue only a small party
of your most loyal subjects.
Not much of your enormous treasure was saved,
and you had only a few ships left
at your command. After years of wandering in the unimaginably large
universe, you stumble upon a galaxy which appears uninhabited, yet
suitable as a first move in attempting to regain your glory.
You install your Capital at
the center of the galaxy.
As a precaution you send patrol ships to explore
your surroundings. On their return, they bring bad news.
In a nearby galaxy, there is another
kingdom. You decide not to let another catastrophe happen to you.
This time, you are determined to destroy the enemy.
Feeding your computer with all the available information about
this part of the universe produces the following result:

Key concepts
.IP Tellers 10
Teller is the official money used in the universe. One teller equals
150 Uni-Kilos of gold. You currently have 100 Tellers. (The coin
is named after Hieronimus X. Teller, the man who discovered the
existence of Natural Plastic.)
.IP Ships 10
When you escaped, you had with you 15
A-type  HAWKs (High Acceleration War
Kruisers). An A-type HAWK is equipped
with 65 Mega Hertz Laser Blasters , 4 H-bomb Launchers and a 100
Erg Shield. Laser Blasters are used in ship to ship battle,
H-bombs can hit stars. The shield protects you from offensive weapons
used by the enemy. If knowledge is acquired, better ships can be built.
.IP Missiles 10
Missiles are stationary devices that have the capability to intercept
the landing (or the passage) of an enemy ship, and destroy it.
Their activation depends only on the detection of the approaching ship(s).
When detection is made, the missile steers itself
towards the ship and explodes it.
.IP ALMs 10
Anti-Landing-Mines (ALMs) are useful devices to be left on deserted planets.
After their installation they radiate in such a manner that destroys
human body. Anyone (even you) trying to land on such planet
without deactivating the ALMs will have the landing ships destroyed.
The ALMs are detectable and can be remotely deactivated.
If this is done, the planet is completely safe.
.IP Fighters 10
In each A-type HAWK there are 64 fighters, so you have 960
fighters in combat position.
You can recruit additional fighters from among your citizens.
.IP Citizens 10
There are 100 citizens with you. They will work the fields and labor in
the factories, supplying all the life necessities to the entire population.
The number of citizens
increases annually by 10%. Each citizen pays
1 Teller per GSY (Galactical Standard Year), as tax.
.NH
Other objects in the game.
.NH 2
Planets' Properties.
.PP
All the planets in the galaxy are rich
in natural resources. You can establish one or more colonies
on any of the planets.
These colonies can contribute to the war effort in several ways:
.IP 1: 3
Providing nourishment and other life necessities.(Agricultural planet).
.IP 2: 3
Providing mining metals needed to build additional war-ships.(Mining planet).
.IP 3: 3
Building new ships.(Industrial planet).
.IP 4: 3
Developing faster, stronger and more efficient weapons.(Scientific planet).
.PP
Naturally, each activity carried out in a colony requires manpower.
You will have to assign citizens or fighters for that purpose.
.NH 2
Technological Development.
.PP
Assigning people to work as scientists and investing money in
basic research will lead to the development of better weapons.
Better weapons mean ships that need half the manpower to operate,
carry twice the amount of blasting power and
their shield is twice heavier.
When you posses enough knowledge to build B-type ships, you can
build both A-type and B-type ships.  More development will allow you to
build C-type ships, etc.
Of course, in order to develop a more advanced technology, you
need to invest more man-time and money (for each successive level) .
.NH 2
Constructing ships.
.PP
When you have the knowledge, the material, the money, and the
manpower needed to build another HAWK and you wish to do so,
you can build any type of ship you wish.
.NH 2
Espionage.
.PP
Information is a "survive or perish" factor. Knowing the enemy's
bases, war-potential, mines etc. is more than helpful to decide
what to do next. Not knowing it... well.
You can send spies to any star in the galaxy. Be sure to supply
them with enough money to bribe or spend in any way necessary to solicit
the required information .
Not surprisingly, the enemy knows the importance of knowledge too.
You can defend yourself in two ways:
.IP 1:  3
Passively, by tightening up security on the planet ("Black out").
This will make it harder for the enemy's spies to reveal
the truth about the planet. They will have to spend more money,
(and time) to get the information. Nevertheless, no planet can
be totally secured against information leaks.
.IP 2:  3
Actively, by investing money in counter-espionage.
This will NOT prevent the enemy's spies from getting the
information, but as soon as he knows something, you will be
notified exactly what information fell into the enemy's
hands. Unfortunately, this counter-espionage is not spy-proof.
The enemy can discover that you know already about
his hard-acquired information by investing in
counter-counter-espionage. This can go on and on, but
it seems that after a certain point, knowing
that the enemy KNOWS something is of little importance, for
the facts are (possibly) much different by that time.
.NH 2
Time
.PP
The GSY (Galactical
Standard Year) is the time reference for you and your enemy. Each
GSY has 100 GSDs (Galactical Standard Day). The current
time is updated at the end of each command.
Some commands are carried out immediately, while other take time
to be completed. The following events are time consuming,
and their effect is only evident at the end of the year:
.PP
Tax payment, ALM activation, mining metals, buiding new ships,
gathering more knowledge, updating the population size and espionage
reports.
.PP
A GSY equals  about 3 minutes of Earth time.
However, to enable the players to speed up things if
they so wish, a NEW YEAR will arrive also in case that BOTH
players have given the "ny" command (see the "ny" command section).
.NH 2
The Battle
.PP
Any attempt to land upon
an enemy-occupied planet will result in immediate battle.
The balance between the
fighting forces determines the outcome of the battle. Usually
any X-type HAWK equals another X-type HAWK, so that when engaged in fighting
the two ships will destroy each other. If the fighting is between unequal
levels, the (X+1)-type is twice stronger then X-type. For example,
if a B-type ship fights
against an A-type ship, the A-type will be destroyed and the B-type will
remain intact. But if 2 A-type ships fight 1 B-type ship \-
the two forces will destroy each other.
If a ship is hit in a battle, it is totally destroyed,
and whatever it carries is lost.
The above rules hold in cases that the base of the attacking
ships is exactly 1 planet apart from their target. If they had to travel
a longer distance, their combat efficiency decreases. There is a possibility
that a defending ship will destroy an attacking one, of the SAME level,
without getting hurt. These chances increase significantly at distances
longer then 4. If you succeed in conquering a planet,
all its residents become your slaves. If there were any slaves there,
they are freed, for they are your citizens once captured. Any metal
digged now belongs to you. However, if it is a scientific planet, the
knowledge there will be A-level only. The scientists had enough time to destroy
all the evidence for higher knowledge.
.NH 2
Capturing a planet without violence.
.PP
To capture a planet you have to control ALL the planets
that have DIRECT access to that planet. That is, there is no route between
the enemy's capital and the to-be-captured planet
that doesn't go through one of your planets.
If you succeed, all the goods that
are on that planet (even knowledge) are now yours.
The planet's inhabitants, including soldiers, will become your
slaves \- to labor as miners. (You cannot use
the enemy's ships. Their body is different, and all the survival
means are totally alien to you).
.NH 1
Let's get started.
.NH 2
The screen.
.PP
The screen is divided into two areas. The upper area
presents the map shown above. You can see two galaxies. One is
yours and the other is the enemy's. Each galaxy consists of three nested
circles of planets and the Capital in their center.
Between them there are some stars
which (at the beginning of the game) don't belong to either of you.
This area is called the intergalactical area.
The lower part of the screen is used for
communication between you and your faithful Head of Administration.
All the commands are given to him. He is the channel through which
all the information to you is reported, and all your commands properly
delivered to your subjects scattered throughout the galaxy.
The information that is constantly kept updated beneath the map
is the name of the planet under cursor, the amount of money left
and the current year.
Another line is dedicated to messages sent to you by the enemy
and other information that is reported to you. Usually this information
is independent of the last issued command. The messages are
displayed one after the other. It takes about three commands
for the next message to show up, but if the '-' key is pressed, the
next message (if existent) will be displayed immediately.
You are prompted with '-More-' whenever  there is another message
waiting. Also note that the terminal's bell rings when a new
message has arrived.
.NH 2
Moving the cursor.
.PP
If the cursor is within one of the circles in a galaxy,
you can either move along the circle's radius, or along its perimeter.
As a rule, the numerical keypad is used as a direction indicator. For example
the '8' points north, the '6' east and the '1' south-west. The '.' will
move you clockwise, while the ',' counter-clockwise. The '5' key, which is
in the middle, will flip over the page (if the terminal has this capability)
so that the
information on the other side can be reexamined.
To visualize things better, here is the representation of the keypad, as
used by the program. If the terminal lacks keypad \- use imagination.
.PP

.DE
.PP

If the cursor is on one of the
stars between the two galaxies, you can move to all directions but usually
not diagonally.
(The allowed routes in this area are marked on the map below).
If a key other then numeric is pressed, this is interpreted as a
character belonging to a command. Thereupon the cursor will move
down to the line marked 'Command: '. If at any time you wish to return
to the Map section, press the 'esc' key. To return back you can either
press the 'esc' key again, or simply continue the command. (The latter
case holds only if the character typed is NOT numeric.)
.NH 2
The commands
.PP
Many commands require the specification of a planet on which
the intended activity is to take place.
By default, the planet that the cursor is currently on - is the
subject of the command. At any time you can have it's name
printed on the command line by pressing cntr/p .
If you want to specify another planet you can either move
the cursor to it or give its coordinates in Space:
.br
The left galaxy is abbreviated L, the right R and the in-between
region C. In a galaxy the circles are numbered 0-3, with the center
at 0. The planets are numbered 0-7 in circles 1-2 and 0-9 and a-f in
circle 3. The planet at the hour-12 position is the 0 number, and
the rest have consecutive numbers CLOCKWISE. In the center part,
there are 7 rows of planets, numbered 0-6 top to bottom. In each
row there are 3 or 5 planets, numbered 0-4 LEFT to RIGHT in the
first and the last row, and 1-3 in the rest. To clarify
the matter, here is the map with some planets' names written
next to them. The allowed routes in the intergalaxy region are
marked too.

Help \- Get online help during the game.
.PP
With so much information to process, no wonder that you will occasionly
feel lost. The "help" command enables you to receive most of this
manual on the screen during the game.
.PP
Format and examples:
.IP help 20
Get a description of the available "help" options.
.IP "help os" 20
Get the manual entry for the "os" command.
.IP "help -espionage" 20
Get the manual explanation of the espionage factor in this game.
.NH 2
Os \- Report an Overall Statistics.
.PP
At any time, you can ask for an overall evaluation of your
situation. You will receive the statistics concerning your financial,
military and population position. You can add 1 or more characters
to the command (see examples below). As a result, the planets with
the attribute specified in your command will
change their map representation so that they are easily distinguished
from the rest. If the situation has changed
since the last command with the same parameters, the planet
representation defaults to the original one (shown on the map above).
.br
Note that the characters can be
combined. Especially useful is the combination that starts with 'n'.
This restores the whole map to the original representation, so that
any changes are easily noted.
.PP
Format and examples:
.IP os 20
Report a numeric overview of the situation.
.IP "os a" 20
Show on the map the planets that you have trapped with ALM's.
.IP "os b" 20
Show on the map which planet was "blacked out".
.IP "os c" 20
Show on the map where construction of new ships is in progress.
.IP "os d" 20
Show on the map where detect-movement devices were installed.
.IP "os e" 20
Show on the map enemy's planets to which spies have been sent.
.IP "os f" 20
Show on the map the planets with your ships on them.
.IP "os F" 20
Show on the map the planets with your fighters on them.
.IP "os i" 20
Show on the map which of your planets have counter-espionage.
.IP "os k" 20
Show on the map where you have knowledge better then A.
.IP "os m" 20
Show on the map where are your missiles.
.IP "os n" 20
Restore the map to it's original representation.
.IP "os o" 20
Show on the map which planets you own.
.IP "os p" 20
Show on the map where anti-detection paint was invested.
.IP "os s" 20
Show on the map which planet has special category.
.NH 2
Ps \- Report the Planet Situation.
.PP
Information about any
particular planet is also always available, and you can have
its full description reported
to you. The description will include details on the properties of the
planet, its military and economic situation and its inhabitants.
Of course, asking about a planet that doesn't belong to you might result
in very little information.
If espionage reports are needed, they should be explicitly requested.
.PP
Format and examples:
.IP ps 20
Report about the planet under cursor (called "current").
.IP "ps i" 20
Report espionage results in the current planet.
.IP "ps c50" 20
Report about planet c50.
.IP "ps c50 i" 20
Report espionage results in planet c50.
.NH 2
En \- Enquire about a planet.
.PP
Using this command you can invest money in espionage. You have to
specify the planet, the level of espionage, the specific issue of
interest and the amount of money dedicated to
that purpose. Note that some espionage assignments are easier to
carry out, and thus will require less money than others.
The topics that can be subjects of enquiry are:
.PP
The kind of planet (s), planet's population (p), planet's knowledge level (k),
amount of metal (t), number and type of ships there (f), number of
ALMs installed (a), number and type of missiles (m).
.PP
As for the level. Sending spies to get information as per
above is called "zero level" (it need not be specified). Setting
counter-espionage for that level is ALSO "zero level". When the enemy wishes
to establish a counter-counter-espionage it will be called
"first level". This level represents for the defender the
"counter-counter-counter-espionage" and so on.
.PP
Format and examples:
.IP "en f 20" 20
Set spies on current planet, level zero, check out the forces there, investing 20 tellers.
.IP "en c50 s 20" 20
Set spies on c50, level zero, report planet's status investing 20 tellers.
.IP "en c50 1 p 20" 20
Set spies on c50, first level, report the population status investing 20 tellers.
.NH 2
Bo \- Black out a planet.
.PP
This command enables you to make life harder for the enemy's
spies and detective devices. By blacking out a planet, the amount of
time and money needed to obtain information
is increased.
You can black out ANY planet, provided that you have landed on it. This includes
planets on which you plan to install ALMs when leaving.
Note again that this command can be
given only while your forces are ON the planet.
.PP
Format and examples:
.IP "bo 20" 20
Black out the current planet, investing 20 tellers.
.IP "bo c50 20" 20
Black out planet c50, investing 20 tellers.
.NH 2
As \- Assign people from occupation to occupation.
.PP
If you want to change the balance of manpower
among the various occupations on any of your planets,
you can give the As command.
You start with Citizens and Fighters, but you can add Scientists,
Miners and Builders as need arises.
If you have succeeded to take slaves-
they can be assigned to work ONLY in the mines. Remember, however, that
they cannot be trusted even with such simple work. In order for them
to produce anything there must be at least 1 miner from your population
to supervise them.
.PP
Format and examples:
.IP "as 20 c f" 20
Assign from current planet 20 citizens to fighters.
.IP "as c50 20 c s" 20
Assign from c50 20 citizens to scientists.
.IP "as c50 20 m b" 20
Assign from c50 20 miners to builders.
.NH 2
Bs \- Build ships.
.PP
With this command the builders will start working on the construction
of new ships. The command specifies the planet on which the construction
will take place, the level and no. of ships to be built and
the money assigned for that purpose. If any of prerequisites for
ship construction is absent, the work will not start. However,
it is not necessary that the material and/or the money needed
to accomplish ALL the work be available at the time that the
command is given.
.PP
Format and examples:
.IP "bs 2a 20" 20
Build on the current planet 2 A-type ships, investing 20 tellers.
.IP "bs c50 2a 20" 20
Build on c50 2 A-type ships, investing 20 tellers.
.IP "bs 2a" 20
Build 2  A-type ships on the current planet, using money already provided.
.IP "bs c50 t 20" 20
Add 20 tellers to cover building ships expenses on planet c50.
.NH 2
Sm \- Set missiles.
.PP
Missiles are defense weapons. Once installed on a planet,
they cannot be transferred elsewhere. They can intercept and
destroy any enemy ship that tries to land on that planet, as well as
passing by ships. An A-type missile destroys A-type
ship , B-type missile destroys B-type ship etc.
B-type missile destroys 2 A-type ships, etc. As with ship
construction, the knowledge for better missiles should be available
before any attempt at setting them. Also, there must be enough
soldiers to carry out the work.
.PP
Installing missiles does not ensure their operation.
Their activation
depends on detecting the enemy's movement. If not enough money was
invested in detecting devices, the enemy can even land on the
planet without interference from the missiles
( see the "dt" command for details).
.PP
Format and examples:
.IP "sm 2a" 20
Set on the current planet 3 A-type missiles.
.IP "sm c51 2a" 20
Set on c51 2 A-type missiles.
.IP "sm c51 2a 4b" 20
Set on c51 2 A-type and 4 B-type missiles.
.NH 2
Fd \- Feed the population.
.PP
With this very general command you can make your people happy, content
and highly motivated, or ill-tempered good-for-nothing slobs. Not only
food, but all the necessities are acquired with the money you put aside
with this command. If the available money does not suffice
to feed the entire
population, the priority is: Fighters(f), scientists(s), builders(b),
miners(m) and slaves(v). Citizens support themselves,
so there is no need to feed them.
.PP
Format and examples:
.IP "fd 20" 20
Invest 20 tellers to feed the population.
.NH 2
Tr \- Invest in trade.
.PP
Investing money in trade can be of great help. A good trading year
can bring a 5-25 percent profit. The drawback is, of course, that
the money will be available only the NEXT year. The profit percent
highly depends on the number of planets under your control.
If the number is higher than the original number, 0.5 percent
is added per conquered planet. If not, you will have the minimal
profit only.
.PP
Format and examples:
.IP "tr 20" 20
Invest 20 tellers in trade.
.NH 2
Rt \- Retrieve money given.
.PP
Sometimes (too often)  we  all  make  typing  mistakes.
This  command enables a player to recover from SOME of them.
If too much money  was  given  to  feed  the  population(f),
trade(t),   blackout(b)  or  buiding  ships(s),  it  may  be
retrieved, with some lose. Note  that  these  are  the  only
instances that recovery is possible.
.PP
Format and examples:
.IP "rt 1000 t"
Retrieve 1000 Tellers from trade investment.
.IP "rt 1000 f"
Retrieve 1000 Tellers from food given.
.IP "rt 1000 b c50"
Retrieve  1000  Tellers  from  blackout  investment  at
planet c50.
.IP "rt 1000 s"
Retrieve 1000 Tellers from ship building investment  on
current planet.
.NH 2
Tk \- Take people or equipment.
.PP
The Tk command enables
you to take  people or equipment from a specified planet
and move them to another planet. If you intend to move people,
you specify their occupation and number.
An A-type HAWK can carry 128 persons (in addition to the regular crew)
a B-type HAWK carries 256 etc.
In addition, A-type HAWK can carry mining products sufficient to
build another A-type HAWK.  To carry the material for a B-type
HAWK, you need either 2 A-type HAWKs or a B-type HAWK etc.
The amount of mining material is specified by A-type HAWKs quantities.
The only commodity that doesn't raise any
transportation problems is knowledge. Any type HAWK can carry
any type of knowledge.
When a MOVE command is given (see Mv), the maximum
amount of people and material is loaded onto the departing ships.
The priority when loading people is given by the order
specified in the Feed command. (see Fd) .
.PP
Format and examples:
.IP "tk 20 s" 20
Take from current planet 20 scientists.
.IP "tk c50 20 m" 20
Take from c50 20 miners.
.IP "tk c50 k" 20
Take from c50 it's knowledge.
.IP "tk c50 20 t" 20
Take from c50 mining products for 20 A-type HAWKs.
.NH 2
Mv \- Move forces from planet to planet.
.PP
This command enables you to move from planet to planet.
For this end, you specify the base planet,
the destination planet, the direction and the force to be moved.
You can travel
with a single command to any planet that is on a "straight" line.
For example, the following routes are possible:
.PP
From c64 to l38, from r31 to r39, from l27 to l36 etc. However, the
following are NOT possible (with a single command):
.PP
From l17 to l25, from c31 to c20, from r30 to c52 etc.
.PP
If it is possible to move from a given planet to another
via more than one permissible route, the exact direction of movement
may be specified. The direction specification is done with
the same character used to move
the current planet pointer on the screen (see section 3.2), preceded
by the '>' character. If direction is not given, a straight line
direction will be chosen, whenever possible.
.br
If any Tk commands were given to the base planet,
the people and/or the material specified will be moved with the force
mentioned in the Mv command.
Note that the Mv command is in fact a LAND command on the
destination planet.
.PP
Format and examples: (Assuming that the current planet is l00)
.IP "mv -c31 3A" 23
Move from current planet to c31 3 A-type HAWKs.
.IP "mv l3e - 3a" 23
Move from l3e to the current planet 3 A-type HAWKs.
.IP "mv l24 -l20 >8 6A 4B C" 23
Move from l24 to l20 6 A-type, 4 B-type and 1 C-type, going "north".
.NH 2
Lv \- Leave people and/or material at location.
.PP
The Lv command enables you to leave on a planet
anything that you have taken with the Tk command.
When leaving knowledge, it is possible that the knowledge will
still transportable by giving the `k' parameter. If the knowledge
is intended to be left on the planet without any intention to move
it furter, then `K' (upper case) should be specifyied.
.PP
Format and examples:
.IP "lv 20 s" 20
Leave on current planet 20 scientists.
.IP "lv c50 20 m" 20
Leave on c50 20 miners.
.IP "lv c50 k" 20
Leave on c50 the knowledge previously taken, enabling it's movement
to other planets.
.IP "lv c50 K" 20
Leave on c50 the knowledge previously taken.
.IP "lv c50 20 t" 20
Leave on c50 mining products for 20 A-type HAWKs.
.NH 2
Dt \- Install detect movement devices.
.PP
You cannot prevent the enemy from passing by one of your planets.
However,
you can be notified when it happens. Giving the Dt command will install
at a specified planet special Movement Detection devices. They cannot
accurately report WHAT had passed, but only that movement occurred.
As time passes, this devices have a tendency to deteriorate, and after
several years they will be completely ineffective,
if maintenance (money) is not provided.
.PP
Format and examples:
.IP "dt 20" 20
Invest at current planet 20 tellers to detect movement.
.IP "dt c50 20" 20
Invest at c50 20 tellers to detect movement.
.NH 2
Nd \- Paint ship with anti detection paint.
.PP
There is something you can do to prevent the enemy from detecting your
movement in hyper space. You can paint your ships with an
Anti-Magnetic-Glare paint. The effectiveness of this paint is
proportional to the no. of paint layers.
The only drawback (apart from the money involved),
is that the paint wears off when traveling in hyper space.
To repaint the ships you have to land first.
The detection probability is proportional to the AMG paint
condition compared with the strength of the detection devices.
.br
Note that with the money provided the paint is only purchased.
The actual painting will be done only after the "Mv" command was
given, so that the paint will have the maximum effect. There is
no paint left after the "Mv" command execution.
.PP
Format and examples:
.IP "nd 20" 20
Buy AMG paint at current planet with 20 tellers.
.IP "nd c50 20" 20
Buy AMG paint at c50 with 20 tellers .
.NH 2
Lm \- Lay out Anti-Landing-Mines (ALM).
.PP
Any planet can be transformed into a deadly trap.
Laying down the mines is a costly action, not lesser then their deactivation.
In order to lay the mine, (or mines), you have to LAND on the planet.
Only then can you install the mines. These devices become active
one year after their installation. So, you must leave
immediately. Any human form remaining longer then a year
will be totally disintegrated.
.PP
Format and examples:
.IP "lm 2" 20
Install on current planet 2 ALMs.
.IP "lm c50 3" 20
Install on c50 3 ALMs.
.NH 2
Dm \- Deactivate Anti-Landing-Mines (ALM).
.PP
If you are at a short distance from a mined planet,
(one traveling planet apart in ANY direction),
you can try and deactivate the ALMs. It is better to know in advance
HOW MANY of those devices were laid on that planet,
in order to deactivate them all.
Remember that even one ALM can destroy a whole armada, if it
tries to land. If the  mines were installed by yourself, you
know their exact number and location, so that the deactivating
process is less expensive.
.PP
Format and examples:
.IP "dm 2" 20
Deactivate at current planet 2 ALMs.
.IP "dm c50 3" 20
Deactivate at c50 3 ALMs.
.NH 2
Wr \- Write a message to the enemy.
.PP
You can ask/blame/tell your opponent anything you want by
writing him a message. The message should be one line long.
You can write as many as you wish.
If you intend to communicate with him, be patient until he answers back.
.PP
Format and examples:
.IP "wr Shall we take a break and save the game??"
.NH 2
Sv \- Save the game.
.PP
Since this is a game for two players, one session
may not be enough for finishing the game. If one partner wishes to save the game
 and gives the "Sv" command, his opponent will be notified.
If offer accepted, the game will be saved.
(You need two to Tango.) If a "year" had passed and no positive answer was
given, then the TWO players have to agree on saving the game.
If no parameter is given, the game will be saved under the name "galaxy.save".
If a file name was specified, the game will be saved under this name.
.PP
Format and examples:
.IP "sv ~john/games/john_vs_michel"
.NH 2
Rs \- Restore a saved game.
.PP
After lunch is over, and you wish to continue a saved game, give the
"restore" command, using the same file name that you used when saving it.
As with "save", both players must agree.
.PP
Format and examples:
.IP "rs ~john/games/john_vs_michel"
.NH 2
Menu \- See summary of all available commands.
.PP
In case you forget the commands, or their format,
you can have them displayed in a short form.
This is NOT a comprehensive help. To get such help,
type "help <command name>".
.PP
Format and examples:
.IP "menu"
.NH 2
Mp \- Redraw the map of the game.
.PP
If your terminal gets messages from other users, and the galaxies look a mess,
you can rectify things easily by the "map" command. The original map will
be displayed, clearing everything else.
.PP
Format and examples:
.IP "mp"
.NH 2
Nn \- Ask for a break in game.
.PP
The galaxy game tends to be rather long. If a break  is
needed,  then giving the "Nn" command (NO new year) the time
will freeze.  While break is  activated,  all  commands  are
executable  except for "Mv". To resume playing, use the "Ny"
command.
.PP
Format and examples:
.IP "nn"
.NH 2
Ny \- Ask for a new year.
.PP
It may happen that you don't find anything useful to perform
during a current GSY,
and all you do is wait for it to end. By giving the "Ny" command you
can shorten this interval. Of course, in order for the command to be effective,
BOTH players must agree by giving the same command. No report is send
to the enemy that you have given the command, so that each player decides on
his own.
In  addition, this commands resumes a stoped game (by "Nn").
.PP
Format and examples:
.IP "ny"
.NH 2
Qt \- Quit the game.
.PP
If you wish to discontinue the game without losing face, you can give this
command. However, your partner should feel the same and agree too by
giving the same command. Automatic canceling of this command takes place
at the beginning of a new year.
Giving the command AGAIN within the same year has the same effect.
.PP
Format and examples:
.IP "qt"
.NH 2
Gu \- Give up the game.
.PP
If you feel that all is lost, or you got tired of the game, you may surrender.
Naturally, this will be considered a loss, and your opponent will be credited
for that. There is no "back up" to that command, so make sure that this
is truly your intention.
.PP
Format and examples:
.IP "gu"
.NH 2
Cp \- Change player.
.PP
This command is only permissible during practice sessions. Practice sessions
are designed to let one player get familiar with the game by playing
the roles of BOTH sides and thus to get acquainted with all the relevant
aspects of the game from both sides.
See 'man galaxy' for specifications.
.PP
Format and examples:
.IP "cp" 20
Assume the role of the "other" side.
