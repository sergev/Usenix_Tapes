          You were a mighty king of a splendid  galaxy,
     reigning  your  kingdom in peace and abundance for
     hundreds of years.  It  all  ended  suddenly  (and
     sadly)  when  cruel  and powerful villains invaded
     your galaxy. You made a hasty retreat, managing to
     rescue  only a small party of your most loyal sub-
     jects.  Not much of  your  enormous  treasure  was
     saved,  and  you had only a few ships left at your
     command. After years of wandering in the unimagin-
     ably  large  universe,  you  stumble upon a galaxy
     which appears uninhabited, yet suitable as a first
     move  in  attempting  to  regain  your glory.  You
     install your Capital at the center of the  galaxy.
     As  a  precaution you send patrol ships to explore
     your surroundings. On their return, they bring bad
     news.   In a nearby galaxy, there is another king-
     dom. You decide not  to  let  another  catastrophe
     happen  to  you.  This time, you are determined to
     destroy the enemy.  Feeding your computer with all
     the  available  information about this part of the
     universe produces the following result:

Tellers   Teller is the official money used in the universe.
          One  teller  equals  150  Uni-Kilos  of  gold. You
          currently have 100 Tellers.  (The  coin  is  named
          after Hieronimus X. Teller, the man who discovered
          the existence of Natural Plastic.)

Ships     When you escaped,  you  had  with  you  15  A-type
          HAWKs  (High Acceleration War Kruisers). An A-type
          HAWK is equipped with 65 Mega Hertz Laser Blasters
          ,  4  H-bomb Launchers and a 100 Erg Shield. Laser
          Blasters are used in ship to ship battle,  H-bombs
          can hit stars. The shield protects you from offen-
          sive weapons used by the enemy.  If  knowledge  is
          acquired, better ships can be built.

Missiles  Missiles are  stationary  devices  that  have  the
          capability  to  intercept the landing (or the pas-
          sage) of an enemy ship,  and  destroy  it.   Their
          activation  depends  only  on the detection of the
          approaching ship(s).  When detection is made,  the
          missile   steers   itself  towards  the  ship  and
          explodes it.

ALMs      Anti-Landing-Mines (ALMs) are useful devices to be
          left  on  deserted planets.  After their installa-
          tion they radiate in such a manner  that  destroys
          human  body.  Anyone  (even you) trying to land on
          such planet without  deactivating  the  ALMs  will
          have  the  landing  ships destroyed.  The ALMs are

          detectable and can be  remotely  deactivated.   If
          this is done, the planet is completely safe.

Fighters  In each A-type HAWK there are 64 fighters, so  you
          have  960  fighters  in  combat position.  You can
          recruit  additional  fighters  from   among   your
          citizens.

Citizens  There are 100 citizens with you.  They  will  work
          the  fields  and labor in the factories, supplying
          all the life necessities to the entire population.
          The  number of citizens increases annually by 10%.
          Each citizen pays 1  Teller  per  GSY  (Galactical
          Standard Year), as tax.

     All the planets in  the  galaxy  are  rich  in  natural
resources.  You can establish one or more colonies on any of
the planets.  These  colonies  can  contribute  to  the  war
effort in several ways:

1: Providing      nourishment      and      other       life
   necessities.(Agricultural planet).

2: Providing mining metals needed to build  additional  war-
   ships.(Mining planet).

3: Building new ships.(Industrial planet).

4: Developing   faster,   stronger   and   more    efficient
   weapons.(Scientific planet).

     Naturally,  each  activity  carried  out  in  a  colony
requires  manpower.   You  will  have  to assign citizens or
fighters for that purpose.

     Assigning people to work as  scientists  and  investing
money  in  basic  research  will  lead to the development of
better weapons.  Better weapons mean ships  that  need  half
the  manpower to operate, carry twice the amount of blasting
power and their shield is twice heavier.   When  you  posses
enough  knowledge  to build B-type ships, you can build both
A-type and B-type ships.  More development will allow you to
build  C-type  ships, etc.  Of course, in order to develop a
more advanced technology, you need to invest  more  man-time
and money (for each successive level) .

     When you have the knowledge, the material,  the  money,
and  the  manpower needed to build another HAWK and you wish
to do so, you can build any type of ship you wish.

     Information is a "survive or  perish"  factor.  Knowing
the  enemy's  bases,  war-potential, mines etc. is more than
helpful to decide what to do next. Not knowing  it...  well.
You  can  send  spies  to any star in the galaxy. Be sure to
supply them with enough money to bribe or spend in  any  way
necessary   to  solicit  the  required  information  .   Not
surprisingly, the enemy knows the  importance  of  knowledge
too.  You can defend yourself in two ways:

1: Passively,  by  tightening  up  security  on  the  planet
   ("Black  out").  This will make it harder for the enemy's
   spies to reveal the truth about  the  planet.  They  will
   have  to spend more money, (and time) to get the informa-
   tion. Nevertheless, no  planet  can  be  totally  secured
   against information leaks.

2: Actively, by investing money in counter-espionage.   This
   will  NOT  prevent  the  enemy's  spies  from getting the
   information, but as soon as he knows something, you  will
   be  notified  exactly  what  information  fell  into  the
   enemy's hands. Unfortunately, this  counter-espionage  is
   not  spy-proof.   The  enemy  can  discover that you know
   already about his hard-acquired information by  investing
   in  counter-counter-espionage. This can go on and on, but
   it seems that after a certain  point,  knowing  that  the
   enemy  KNOWS  something  is of little importance, for the
   facts are (possibly) much different by that time.

_2._5.  _T_i_m_e

     The GSY (Galactical Standard Year) is the  time  refer-
ence for you and your enemy. Each GSY has 100 GSDs (Galacti-
cal Standard Day). The current time is updated at the end of
each  command.   Some  commands are carried out immediately,
while other take time to be completed. The following  events
are  time consuming, and their effect is only evident at the
end of the year:

     Tax payment, ALM activation, mining metals, buiding new
ships,  gathering  more  knowledge,  updating the population
size and espionage reports.

     A GSY equals  about 3 minutes of Earth time.   However,
to  enable the players to speed up things if they so wish, a
NEW YEAR will arrive also in case  that  BOTH  players  have
given the "ny" command (see the "ny" command section).

     Any attempt to land upon an enemy-occupied planet  will
result  in immediate battle.  The balance between the fight-
ing forces determines the outcome of the battle. Usually any
X-type HAWK equals another X-type HAWK, so that when engaged
in fighting the two ships will destroy each  other.  If  the
fighting  is between unequal levels, the (X+1)-type is twice
stronger then X-type. For example, if a B-type  ship  fights
against an A-type ship, the A-type will be destroyed and the
B-type will remain intact. But if 2 A-type ships fight 1  B-
type  ship  -  the two forces will destroy each other.  If a
ship is hit in a battle, it is totally destroyed, and  what-
ever it carries is lost.  The above rules hold in cases that
the base of the attacking ships is exactly  1  planet  apart
from  their target. If they had to travel a longer distance,
their combat efficiency decreases. There  is  a  possibility
that  a defending ship will destroy an attacking one, of the
SAME level, without getting  hurt.  These  chances  increase
significantly  at distances longer then 4. If you succeed in
conquering a planet, all its residents become  your  slaves.
If there were any slaves there, they are freed, for they are
your citizens once captured. Any metal digged now belongs to
you.  However,  if  it is a scientific planet, the knowledge
there will be A-level only. The scientists had  enough  time
to destroy all the evidence for higher knowledge.

     To capture a planet you have to control ALL the planets
that have DIRECT access to that planet. That is, there is no
route between the enemy's  capital  and  the  to-be-captured
planet  that doesn't go through one of your planets.  If you
succeed, all  the  goods  that  are  on  that  planet  (even
knowledge) are now yours.  The planet's inhabitants, includ-
ing soldiers, will become your slaves - to labor as  miners.
(You  cannot use the enemy's ships. Their body is different,
and all the survival means are totally alien to you).

     The screen is divided into two areas.  The  upper  area
presents  the map shown above. You can see two galaxies. One
is yours and the other is the enemy's. Each galaxy  consists
of  three nested circles of planets and the Capital in their
center.  Between them there are some  stars  which  (at  the
beginning  of the game) don't belong to either of you.  This
area is called the intergalactical area.  The lower part  of
the  screen  is  used for communication between you and your
faithful Head of Administration.  All the commands are given
to  him. He is the channel through which all the information
to you is reported, and all your commands properly delivered

to  your  subjects  scattered  throughout  the  galaxy.  The
information that is constantly kept updated beneath the  map
is  the name of the planet under cursor, the amount of money
left and the current year.  Another  line  is  dedicated  to
messages sent to you by the enemy and other information that
is reported to you. Usually this information is  independent
of  the  last issued command. The messages are displayed one
after the other. It takes about three commands for the  next
message  to show up, but if the '-' key is pressed, the next
message (if existent) will be  displayed  immediately.   You
are  prompted  with '-More-' whenever  there is another mes-
sage waiting. Also note that the terminal's bell rings  when
a new message has arrived.

     If the cursor is within one of the circles in a galaxy,
you  can either move along the circle's radius, or along its
perimeter.  As a rule, the numerical keypad  is  used  as  a
direction  indicator.  For example the '8' points north, the
'6' east and the '1'  south-west.  The  '.'  will  move  you
clockwise,  while  the  ','  counter-clockwise. The '5' key,
which is in the middle, will flip over the page (if the ter-
minal  has  this  capability) so that the information on the
other side can be reexamined.  To visualize  things  better,
here  is  the  representation  of the keypad, as used by the
program. If the terminal lacks keypad - use imagination.

     If the cursor is on one of the stars  between  the  two
galaxies,  you  can  move  to all directions but usually not
diagonally.  (The allowed routes in this area are marked  on
the  map  below).   If  a key other then numeric is pressed,
this is interpreted as a character belonging to  a  command.
Thereupon the cursor will move down to the line marked 'Com-
mand: '. If at any time you wish to return to the  Map  sec-
tion,  press  the  'esc'  key. To return back you can either
press the 'esc' key again, or simply continue  the  command.
(The  latter  case  holds only if the character typed is NOT
numeric.)

     Many commands require the specification of a planet  on
which  the  intended activity is to take place.  By default,
the planet that the cursor is currently on - is the  subject

of  the  command. At any time you can have it's name printed
on the command line by pressing cntr/p .   If  you  want  to
specify  another planet you can either move the cursor to it
or give its coordinates in Space:
The left galaxy is abbreviated L, the right R  and  the  in-
between  region C. In a galaxy the circles are numbered 0-3,
with the center at 0. The planets are numbered 0-7  in  cir-
cles  1-2  and  0-9  and  a-f in circle 3. The planet at the
hour-12 position is the 0 number, and the rest have consecu-
tive numbers CLOCKWISE. In the center part, there are 7 rows
of planets, numbered 0-6 top to bottom. In  each  row  there
are  3 or 5 planets, numbered 0-4 LEFT to RIGHT in the first
and the last row, and  1-3  in  the  rest.  To  clarify  the
matter,  here  is  the  map with some planets' names written
next to them. The allowed routes in the  intergalaxy  region
are marked too.

     With so much information to process, no wonder that you
will occasionly feel lost. The "help" command enables you to
receive most of this manual on the screen during the game.

     At any time, you can ask for an overall  evaluation  of
your  situation.  You will receive the statistics concerning
your financial, military and population  position.  You  can
add  1  or  more  characters  to  the  command (see examples
below). As a result, the planets with the  attribute  speci-
fied in your command will change their map representation so
that they are easily distinguished from  the  rest.  If  the
situation  has  changed since the last command with the same
parameters, the planet representation defaults to the origi-
nal one (shown on the map above).
Note that the characters can be combined. Especially  useful
is  the combination that starts with 'n'.  This restores the
whole map  to  the  original  representation,  so  that  any
changes are easily noted.

     Information about any particular planet is also  always
available, and you can have its full description reported to
you. The description will include details on the  properties
of  the  planet, its military and economic situation and its
inhabitants.  Of course, asking about a planet that  doesn't
belong  to  you might result in very little information.  If
espionage reports are  needed,  they  should  be  explicitly
requested.

     Format and examples:

ps                  Report about  the  planet  under  cursor
                    (called "current").

                    planet.

     Using this command you can invest money  in  espionage.
You  have to specify the planet, the level of espionage, the
specific issue of interest and the amount of money dedicated
to  that  purpose.  Note that some espionage assignments are
easier to carry out, and thus will require less  money  than
others.  The topics that can be subjects of enquiry are:

     The  kind  of  planet  (s),  planet's  population  (p),
planet's  knowledge  level  (k), amount of metal (t), number
and type of ships there (f), number of ALMs  installed  (a),
number and type of missiles (m).

     As for the level. Sending spies to get  information  as
per above is called "zero level" (it need not be specified).
Setting counter-espionage  for  that  level  is  ALSO  "zero
level".  When  the  enemy  wishes  to  establish  a counter-
counter-espionage it will  be  called  "first  level".  This
level  represents  for  the  defender  the "counter-counter-

counter-espionage" and so on.

     Format and examples:

     This command enables you to make life  harder  for  the
enemy's  spies  and  detective  devices.  By  blacking out a
planet, the amount of time and money needed to obtain infor-
mation is increased.  You can black out ANY planet, provided
that you have landed on it. This includes planets  on  which
you plan to install ALMs when leaving.  Note again that this
command can be given only  while  your  forces  are  ON  the
planet.

     Format and examples:

bo 20               Black out the current planet,  investing
                    20 tellers.

                    ers.

     If you want to change the balance of manpower among the
various occupations on any of your planets, you can give the
As command.  You start with Citizens and Fighters,  but  you
can  add Scientists, Miners and Builders as need arises.  If
you have succeeded to take slaves- they can be  assigned  to
work  ONLY in the mines. Remember, however, that they cannot
be trusted even with such simple work. In order for them  to
produce  anything  there  must be at least 1 miner from your
population to supervise them.

     Format and examples:

as 20 c f           Assign from current planet  20  citizens
                    to fighters.

_3._1_0.  _B_s - _B_u_i_l_d _s_h_i_p_s.

     With this command the builders will  start  working  on
the  construction  of  new  ships. The command specifies the
planet on which the construction will take place, the  level
and no. of ships to be built and the money assigned for that
purpose. If any of prerequisites for  ship  construction  is
absent,  the  work will not start. However, it is not neces-
sary that the material and/or the money needed to accomplish
ALL  the  work  be available at the time that the command is
given.

     Format and examples:

bs 2a 20            Build on the  current  planet  2  A-type
                    ships, investing 20 tellers.

bs c50 2a 20        Build on c50 2 A-type  ships,  investing
                    20 tellers.

bs 2a               Build 2  A-type  ships  on  the  current
                    planet, using money already provided.

bs c50 t 20         Add 20 tellers to cover  building  ships
                    expenses on planet c50.

     Missiles are  defense  weapons.  Once  installed  on  a
planet,  they  cannot  be  transferred  elsewhere.  They can
intercept and destroy any enemy ship that tries to  land  on
that  planet, as well as passing by ships. An A-type missile
destroys A-type ship , B-type missile destroys  B-type  ship
etc.   B-type  missile destroys 2 A-type ships, etc. As with
ship construction, the knowledge for better missiles  should
be available before any attempt at setting them. Also, there
must be enough soldiers to carry out the work.

     Installing missiles does not  ensure  their  operation.
Their  activation depends on detecting the enemy's movement.
If not enough money was invested in detecting  devices,  the
enemy  can even land on the planet without interference from
the missiles ( see the "dt" command for details).

     Format and examples:

sm 2a               Set on the current planet 3 A-type  mis-
                    siles.

     With this very general command you can make your people
happy,  content  and highly motivated, or ill-tempered good-
for-nothing slobs. Not only food, but  all  the  necessities
are acquired with the money you put aside with this command.
If the available money does not suffice to feed  the  entire
population,  the  priority  is:  Fighters(f), scientists(s),
builders(b), miners(m) and slaves(v). Citizens support them-
selves, so there is no need to feed them.

     Format and examples:

fd 20               Invest 20 tellers to  feed  the  popula-
                    tion.

     Investing money in trade can be of great help.  A  good
trading  year  can bring a 5-25 percent profit. The drawback
is, of course, that the money will  be  available  only  the
NEXT  year.  The profit percent highly depends on the number
of planets under your control.  If the number is higher than
the  original  number,  0.5  percent  is added per conquered
planet. If not, you will have the minimal profit only.

     Format and examples:

tr 20               Invest 20 tellers in trade.

     Sometimes (too often)  we  all  make  typing  mistakes.
This  command enables a player to recover from SOME of them.
If too much money  was  given  to  feed  the  population(f),
trade(t),   blackout(b)  or  buiding  ships(s),  it  may  be
retrieved, with some lose. Note  that  these  are  the  only
instances that recovery is possible.

     The Tk command enables you to take  people or equipment
from  a specified planet and move them to another planet. If
you intend to move people, you specify their occupation  and
number.   An  A-type HAWK can carry 128 persons (in addition
to the regular crew) a B-type  HAWK  carries  256  etc.   In
addition,  A-type  HAWK can carry mining products sufficient
to build another A-type HAWK.  To carry the material  for  a
B-type HAWK, you need either 2 A-type HAWKs or a B-type HAWK
etc.  The amount of mining material is specified  by  A-type
HAWKs quantities.  The only commodity that doesn't raise any
transportation problems is  knowledge.  Any  type  HAWK  can
carry  any  type of knowledge.  When a MOVE command is given
(see Mv), the maximum  amount  of  people  and  material  is
loaded  onto the departing ships.  The priority when loading
people is given by the order specified in the Feed  command.
(see Fd) .

     Format and examples:

tk 20 s             Take from current planet 20 scientists.

tk c50 20 m         Take from c50 20 miners.

     This command enables you to move from planet to planet.
For  this  end, you specify the base planet, the destination
planet, the direction and the force to be  moved.   You  can
travel  with  a  single  command  to any planet that is on a
"straight" line.  For example, the following routes are pos-
sible:

     From c64 to l38, from r31 to r39, from l27 to l36  etc.
However,  the following are NOT possible (with a single com-
mand):

     From l17 to l25, from c31 to c20, from r30 to c52 etc.

     If it is possible  to  move  from  a  given  planet  to
another  via  more  than  one  permissible  route, the exact
direction  of  movement  may  be  specified.  The  direction
specification  is  done with the same character used to move
the current planet pointer on the screen (see section  3.2),
preceded  by the '>' character. If direction is not given, a

straight line direction will be chosen, whenever possible.
If any Tk commands were given to the base planet, the people
and/or  the  material specified will be moved with the force
mentioned in the Mv command.  Note that the Mv command is in
fact a LAND command on the destination planet.

     Format and examples: (Assuming that the current  planet
is l00)

mv -c31 3A             Move from current planet to c31 3  A-
                       type HAWKs.

mv l3e - 3a            Move from l3e to the current planet 3
                       A-type HAWKs.

mv l24 -l20 >8 6A 4B C Move from l24 to l20 6 A-type,  4  B-
                       type and 1 C-type, going "north".

     The Lv command enables you to leave on  a  planet  any-
thing that you have taken with the Tk command.  When leaving
knowledge, it is possible  that  the  knowledge  will  still
transportable  by giving the `k' parameter. If the knowledge
is intended to be left on the planet without  any  intention
to   move  it  furter,  then  `K'  (upper  case)  should  be
specifyied.

     Format and examples:

lv 20 s             Leave on current planet 20 scientists.

lv c50 20 m         Leave on c50 20 miners.

lv c50 k            Leave on c50  the  knowledge  previously
                    taken,  enabling  it's movement to other
                    planets.

lv c50 K            Leave on c50  the  knowledge  previously
                    taken.

     You cannot prevent the enemy from  passing  by  one  of
your planets.  However, you can be notified when it happens.
Giving the Dt command will install  at  a  specified  planet
special  Movement  Detection devices. They cannot accurately
report WHAT had passed, but only that movement occurred.  As
time  passes,  this  devices have a tendency to deteriorate,
and after several years they will be completely ineffective,
if maintenance (money) is not provided.

     There is something you can do to prevent the enemy from
detecting  your  movement in hyper space. You can paint your
ships with an Anti-Magnetic-Glare paint.  The  effectiveness
of  this  paint  is proportional to the no. of paint layers.
The only drawback (apart from the money involved),  is  that
the  paint  wears  off  when  traveling  in hyper space.  To
repaint the ships you have to  land  first.   The  detection
probability  is proportional to the AMG paint condition com-
pared with the strength of the detection devices.
Note that with the money provided the  paint  is  only  pur-
chased.   The  actual  painting  will be done only after the
"Mv" command was given, so that the paint will have the max-
imum  effect.  There is no paint left after the "Mv" command
execution.

     Any planet can be transformed into a deadly trap.  Lay-
ing down the mines is a costly action, not lesser then their
deactivation.  In order to lay the  mine,  (or  mines),  you
have  to  LAND on the planet.  Only then can you install the
mines. These devices become  active  one  year  after  their
installation. So, you must leave immediately. Any human form
remaining longer then a year will be totally disintegrated.

     Format and examples:

lm 2                Install on current planet 2 ALMs.

     If you are at a short distance  from  a  mined  planet,
(one  traveling  planet apart in ANY direction), you can try
and deactivate the ALMs. It is better to know in advance HOW
MANY  of those devices were laid on that planet, in order to

deactivate them all.  Remember that even one ALM can destroy
a  whole  armada,  if  it  tries to land. If the  mines were
installed by yourself, you know their exact number and loca-
tion, so that the deactivating process is less expensive.

     Format and examples:

     You can ask/blame/tell your opponent anything you  want
by  writing  him  a  message. The message should be one line
long.  You can write as many as you wish.  If you intend  to
communicate with him, be patient until he answers back.

     Since this is a game for two players, one  session  may
not  be enough for finishing the game. If one partner wishes
to save the game
 and gives the "Sv" command, his opponent will be  notified.
If offer accepted, the game will be saved.  (You need two to

     After lunch is over, and you wish to continue  a  saved
game,  give  the "restore" command, using the same file name
that you used when saving it.  As with "save", both  players
must agree.

comprehensive help. To get such help,  type  "help  <command
name>".

     If your terminal gets messages from  other  users,  and
the  galaxies  look a mess, you can rectify things easily by
the "map" command.  The  original  map  will  be  displayed,
clearing everything else.

     Format and examples:

mp

_3._2_7.  _N_n - _A_s_k _f_o_r _a _b_r_e_a_k _i_n _g_a_m_e.

     The galaxy game tends to be rather long. If a break  is
needed,  then giving the "Nn" command (NO new year) the time
will freeze.  While break is  activated,  all  commands  are
executable  except for "Mv". To resume playing, use the "Ny"
command.

     Format and examples:

nn

_3._2_8.  _N_y - _A_s_k _f_o_r _a _n_e_w _y_e_a_r.

     It may happen that you don't find  anything  useful  to
perform  during a current GSY, and all you do is wait for it
to end. By giving the "Ny"  command  you  can  shorten  this
interval.  Of  course, in order for the command to be effec-
tive, BOTH players must agree by giving the same command. No
report is send to the enemy that you have given the command,
so that each player decides on his own.  In  addition,  this
commands resumes a stoped game (by "Nn").

     Format and examples:

ny

_3._2_9.  _Q_t - _Q_u_i_t _t_h_e _g_a_m_e.

     If you wish to  discontinue  the  game  without  losing
face,  you  can  give  this  command.  However, your partner
should feel the same and agree too by giving the  same  com-
mand. Automatic canceling of this command takes place at the
beginning of a new year.  Giving the  command  AGAIN  within
the same year has the same effect.

     If you feel that all is lost, or you got tired  of  the
game, you may surrender.  Naturally, this will be considered
a loss, and your opponent will be credited for  that.  There
is  no  "back up" to that command, so make sure that this is
truly your intention.

     This command is only permissible during  practice  ses-
sions.  Practice sessions are designed to let one player get
familiar with the game by playing the roles  of  BOTH  sides
and  thus to get acquainted with all the relevant aspects of
the game from both sides.  See 'man galaxy'  for  specifica-
tions.
