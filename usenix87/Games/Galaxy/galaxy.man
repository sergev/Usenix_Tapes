NAME
     galaxy, okgalaxy - A two player duel in space

SYNOPSIS
     /usr/games/galaxy [ -t -a -m user ]
     /usr/games/okgalaxy

DESCRIPTION
     _G_a_l_a_x_y is a game of strategy and cunning for two players.
     It is played on two different CRT terminals, which must be
     from among those supported by vi(1). The game displays a map
     of a remote part of the universe, with two identical galax-
     ies on each terminal.  Each player owns one galaxy. The aim
     of the game is to conquer the opponent's Capital, which is
     the center of his galaxy.  _B_o_t_h _p_l_a_y_e_r_s give commands simul-
     taneously, without knowing the enemy's position and inten-
     tions.
     There are quite a few commands, that enable each player to
     perform various tasks. Refer to the _G_a_l_a_x_y'_s document for
     specification. The "help" command enables online review of
     major parts from that document.

     To play the _g_a_l_a_x_y game, run /usr/games/galaxy.  You will be
     asked who do you want to play with.  You should specify a
     logged in user name.  That user will receive a message ask-
     ing him to accept the challenge.  If he accepts, he should
     run /usr/games/okgalaxy within some reasonable time. Only
     then the game starts.

     If you wish to practice _g_a_l_a_x_y you can enter "-null" instead
     of a real user name. You then have the ability to see and/or
     command the "other" side by giving the "cp" (change player)
     command. You can switch back easily by the same command.

     To see the scores obtained so far, run /usr/games/galaxy
     with the following options:
     -t     - show the top 10 players and related statistics.
     -a     - show all games played so far.
     -m     - show all the games played by you.
     user    - show all games played by 'user'.
     Further documentation may be found in _G_a_l_a_x_y'_s document.

BUGS
     Infinity is a good approximtion.  The document is lengthy
     and lacks humor.
