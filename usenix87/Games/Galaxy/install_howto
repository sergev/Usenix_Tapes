***************************************************************
*          PLEASE NOTICE THE FOLLOWING CONDITIONS             *
***************************************************************

As the authors of the game, we would like to make some
requests and remarks concerning the game installation.

1. The sources contained hereby are distributed free, for the
   much hoped enjoyment of all game lovers.

2. Being in public domain, anyone is entitled to change/add/delete
   anything he wishes.

3. We make a distinction between two kinds of changes:
   "Bug fix" - a change that brings the game to act closer to
                the way it should. (As defined in the document).
   "Enhancement" - a change that alters the way a player THINKS
                during the play.
   As a test to distinguish between the two, one should answer
   the question:
   "Will I play differently BECAUSE of that change?"

4. We would appreciate hearing about changes of the first kind.
   If possible, please mail them to us.

5. If a change of the second kind is introduced, we expect the
   person to compile it under a DIFFERENT name.
   (However similar to the origin). In addition, we would like
   to hear about it, and the reasoning behind it.

7. The game may be redistributed on the condition that no file
   from the original distribution will be left out.

8. The reason for the requests above is:
      Galaxy is different from many computer games, by involving
   TWO players at the same time. It is our wish that two
   people from different SITES will be able to compete one
   against the other. This can be achieved ONLY if the rules and
   conditions specified in the document remain intact.

9. On the other hand, we are eagerly waiting for reactions
   of any kind. If there will be some public opinion concerning
   the way the game SHOULD be, we will correct it on future
   versions.

***************************************************************
*          END OF CONDITIONS. NOW THE FUN.                    *

  Installing galaxy - Three ways to treat a lady.

1. Run the install.sh in this directory. It must be run with
   Super User privileges, so at least read it before typing
   the command.
2. Refer to the end of this document, which outlines a step by
   step procedure.
3. Read further, and possibly gain more insight to the structure
   of this game.

Contents of the distribution directory.

The distribution directory contains several subdirectories:
"Src" holds the source for the main program and "src1" has the
source for miscellaneous programs.
"Man" holds the manual page, for general reference.
"Doc" contains the complete documentation for the novice and
experienced player.
"Online" is the same document in small pieces, that can be viewed
during the game.

After compiling the source two programs are obtained:
"galaxy" and "okgalaxy".
"galaxy" is the game itself. Whenever a user wishes to challenge
somebody to this play, he should run "galaxy". If the offer is
accepted, the other user runs "okgalaxy".

Protection

In order to enjoy the game to it's full potential, ALL relevant
files should have their access bits set so that NO forgery
is possible. When a game is saved, the saved file belongs to
"galaxy", and it's mode set to 600. Encryption is used as a further
protection tool. The encryption source file is the ONLY code that should
not be left open to public.

The two runable modules belong to galaxy.
Their mode should be 4111.
The directory "/usr/games/lib/galaxy" is to be owned by galaxy too,
and have it's mode bits set to 700.

Manuals

"Nroff" the document and the manual page. Place them in their
appropriate place.

(The "Galaxy.doc" at "/usr/doc" and "Galaxy.nrf" in "/usr/doc/nroffed").

The "online" holds the entries for the online "help" facility of
the game. It should be copied entirely to "/usr/games/lib/galaxy/online"
directory.


Terminals

The screen is a vital instrument here. The game looks for the type
of terminal used, as defined by TERM in the environment. It then
extracts some entries from the "termcap" data base. If the
terminal lacks some basic capabilities, the session will be aborted.
        ***** High baud rates are recommended. *****
One feature of the game is it's ability to make good use of
2 screens terminals. There is NO entry for "FLip to the next page" and
"Flip Back to the previous page" in termcap(5). In many new terminals
such capability exists. If such is the case at your place, add those
two entries. We have defined them as "fl" and "fb" respectively.
This feature is NOT essential to the game.
Another assumption, however, IS. We assume existence of a numeric keypad.
There might be a way do avoid such prerequisite,
with the cost of much less comfort to the players.

Installation - step by step

The procedure outlined here is a detailed version of the
command file install.sh in this directory.


It is assumed that a uid named "galaxy" is created, within the
"games" group. To avoid use of super user privileges, all files
belong to galaxy.

The variables outlined here can be freely changed.

SDIR     =  /users/guest/galaxy           ; the "home" dir.

; subdirectories within "home" directory.

SOURCES  =  $SDIR/src
SOURCES1 =  $SDIR/src1
MAN      =  $SDIR/man
DOC      =  $SDIR/doc
ONLINE   =  $SDIR/online

; where most of the game will reside

LIBDIR   =  /usr/games/lib/galaxy

; create LIBDIR with galaxy ownership

        mkdir $LIBDIR
        chown galaxy $LIBDIR

; compile the programs and...
; transfer them to their place and...
; take care of mode bits.

cd $SOURCES; make galaxy
make install
cd $SOURCES1; make all
make install


; create the score file

echo > galaxy.scor                              # score file.
chown galaxy galaxy.scor

;   make a file in /usr/games/lib/galaxy by the name "wizards".
;   This file should contain login names of people who would
;   like to experiment and debug (???) things in that game.
;   They have great power as wizards.

echo mrdch > wizards                            # wizard file
chown galaxy wizards
chmod 600 wizards

; Take care of documentation...

cp $MAN/galaxy.6 /usr/man/man6/galaxy.6         # manual
cp $DOC/galaxy.doc /usr/doc/galaxy              # document

; and the online documentation.

mkdir $LIBDIR/online ; chown galaxy $LIBDIR/online
cp $ONLINE/* $LIBDIR/online ; chown galaxy $LIBDIR/online/*

; The following suggestions are not essential, but recommended.

    Copy the sources to /usr/src/games/galaxy

    Read the "Terminals" paragraph above, and see if you can do
    something about it.

    We cannot over-emphasize our request for comments criticism and,
    yes, even encouragements.
