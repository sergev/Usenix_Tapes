                     As - Assign people from occupation to occupation.

     If you want to change the balance of manpower among the various  occupa-
tions  on  any  of your planets, you can give the As command.  You start with
Citizens and Fighters, but you can add Scientists,  Miners  and  Builders  as
need  arises.  If  you have succeeded to take slaves- they can be assigned to
work ONLY in the mines. Remember, however, that they cannot be  trusted  even
with such simple work. In order for them to produce anything there must be at
least 1 miner from your population to supervise them.

     Format and examples:

as 20 c f           Assign from current planet 20 citizens to fighters.

as c50 20 c s       Assign from c50 20 citizens to scientists.

as c50 20 m b       Assign from c50 20 miners to builders.
