                             The Battle

     Any attempt to land upon an enemy-occupied planet will result in immedi-
ate  battle.   The balance between the fighting forces determines the outcome
of the battle. Usually any X-type HAWK equals another X-type  HAWK,  so  that
when engaged in fighting the two ships will destroy each other. If the fight-
ing is between unequal levels, the (X+1)-type is twice stronger then  X-type.
For  example, if a B-type ship fights against an A-type ship, the A-type will
be destroyed and the B-type will remain intact. But if 2 A-type ships fight 1
B-type  ship - the two forces will destroy each other.  If a ship is hit in a
battle, it is totally destroyed, and whatever it carries is lost.  The  above
rules  hold in cases that the base of the attacking ships is exactly 1 planet
apart from their target. If they had to travel a longer distance, their  com-
bat  efficiency  decreases. There is a possibility that a defending ship will
destroy an attacking one, of the SAME  level,  without  getting  hurt.  These
chances  increase significantly at distances longer then 4. If you succeed in
conquering a planet, all its residents become your slaves. If there were  any
slaves  there,  they are freed, for they are your citizens once captured. Any
metal digged now belongs to you. However, if it is a scientific  planet,  the
knowledge  there will be A-level only. The scientists had enough time to des-
troy all the evidence for higher knowledge.
