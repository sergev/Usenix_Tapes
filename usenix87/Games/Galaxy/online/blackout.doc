                     Bo - Black out a planet.

     This command enables you to make life harder for the enemy's  spies  and
detective  devices.  By  blacking  out a planet, the amount of time and money
needed to obtain information is increased. You can black out ANY planet, pro-
vided  that you have landed on it. This includes planets on which you plan to
install ALMs when leaving.  Note again that this command can  be  given  only
while your forces are ON the planet.

     Format and examples:

bo 20               Black out the current planet, investing 20 tellers.

bo c50 20           Black out planet c50, investing 20 tellers.
