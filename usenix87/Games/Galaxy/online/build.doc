                     Bs - Build ships.

     With this command the builders will start working on the construction of
new  ships.  The  command specifies the planet on which the construction will
take place, the level and no. of ships to be built and the money assigned for
that  purpose.  If  any of prerequisites for ship construction is absent, the
work will not start. However, it is not necessary that  the  material  and/or
the money needed to accomplish ALL the work be available at the time that the
command is given.
