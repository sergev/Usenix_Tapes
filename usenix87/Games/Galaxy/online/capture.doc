               Capturing a planet without violence.

     To capture a planet you have to control ALL the planets that have DIRECT
access to that planet. That is, there is no route between the enemy's capital
and the to-be-captured planet that doesn't go through one  of  your  planets.
If  you  succeed,  all the goods that are on that planet (even knowledge) are
now yours.  The planet's inhabitants, including soldiers,  will  become  your
slaves - to labor as miners. (You cannot use the enemy's ships. Their body is
different, and all the survival means are totally alien to you).
