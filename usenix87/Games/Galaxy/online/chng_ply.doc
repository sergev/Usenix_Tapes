                     Cp - Change player.

     This command is only permissible during practice sessions. Practice ses-
sions  are  designed  to let one player get familiar with the game by playing
the roles of BOTH sides and thus to get  acquainted  with  all  the  relevant
aspects of the game from both sides.  See 'man galaxy' for specifications.

     Format and examples:

cp                  Assume the role of the "other" side.
