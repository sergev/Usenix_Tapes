                              Key concepts  - part 1

Tellers   Teller is the official money  used  in  the  universe.  One  teller
          equals  150 Uni-Kilos of gold. You currently have 100 Tellers. (The
          coin is named after Hieronimus X. Teller, the  man  who  discovered
          the existence of Natural Plastic.)

Ships     When you escaped, you had with you 15 A-type  HAWKs (High Accelera-
          tion  War  Kruisers). An A-type HAWK is equipped with 65 Mega Hertz
          Laser Blasters , 4 H-bomb Launchers and a  100  Erg  Shield.  Laser
          Blasters  are  used  in ship to ship battle, H-bombs can hit stars.
          The shield protects you from offensive weapons used by  the  enemy.
          If knowledge is acquired, better ships can be built.

Missiles  Missiles are stationary devices that have the capability to  inter-
          cept the landing (or the passage) of an enemy ship, and destroy it.
          Their activation depends only on the detection of  the  approaching
          ship(s).  When detection is made, the missile steers itself towards
          the ship and explodes it.
