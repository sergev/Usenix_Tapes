                              Key concepts  - part 2

ALMs      Anti-Landing-Mines (ALMs) are useful devices to be left on deserted
          planets.   After  their  installation they radiate in such a manner
          that destroys human body. Anyone (even you) trying to land on  such
          planet  without  deactivating  the ALMs will have the landing ships
          destroyed.  The ALMs are  detectable  and  can  be  remotely  deac-
          tivated.  If this is done, the planet is completely safe.

Fighters  In each A-type HAWK there are 64 fighters, so you have 960 fighters
          in combat position.  You can recruit additional fighters from among
          your citizens.

Citizens  There are 100 citizens with you. They  will  work  the  fields  and
          labor  in  the factories, supplying all the life necessities to the
          entire population.  The number of citizens  increases  annually  by
          10%. Each citizen pays 1 Teller per GSY (Galactical Standard Year),
          as tax.
