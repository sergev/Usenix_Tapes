      Planets' Properties.

     All the planets in the galaxy are rich in  natural  resources.  You  can
establish  one  or  more  colonies on any of the planets.  These colonies can
contribute to the war effort in several ways:

1: Providing nourishment and other life necessities.(Agricultural planet).

2: Providing mining  metals  needed  to  build  additional  war-ships.(Mining
   planet).

3: Building new ships.(Industrial planet).

4: Developing  faster,  stronger  and  more   efficient   weapons.(Scientific
   planet).

     Naturally, each activity carried out in a colony requires manpower.  You
will have to assign citizens or fighters for that purpose.
