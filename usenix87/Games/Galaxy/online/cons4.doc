                              Key concepts  - part 4

      Technological Development.

     Assigning people to work as scientists  and  investing  money  in  basic
research will lead to the development of better weapons.  Better weapons mean
ships that need half the manpower to  operate,  carry  twice  the  amount  of
blasting  power  and  their  shield is twice heavier.  When you posses enough
knowledge to build B-type ships, you can build both A-type and B-type  ships.
More  development  will  allow you to build C-type ships, etc.  Of course, in
order to develop a more advanced technology, you need to invest more man-time
and money (for each successive level) .

      Constructing ships.

     When you have the knowledge, the material, the money, and  the  manpower
needed to build another HAWK and you wish to do so, you can build any type of
ship you wish.
