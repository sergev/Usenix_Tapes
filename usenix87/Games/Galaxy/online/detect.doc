                     Dt - Install detect movement devices.

     You cannot prevent the enemy from passing by one of your planets.   How-
ever, you can be notified when it happens. Giving the Dt command will install
at a specified planet special Movement Detection devices. They  cannot  accu-
rately  report  WHAT  had  passed,  but only that movement occurred.  As time
passes, this devices have a tendency to deteriorate, and after several  years
they will be completely ineffective, if maintenance (money) is not provided.

     Format and examples:

dt 20               Invest at current planet 20 tellers to detect movement.

dt c50 20           Invest at c50 20 tellers to detect movement.
