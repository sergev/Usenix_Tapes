                                Espionage.
     Information is a "survive or perish" factor. Knowing the enemy's  bases,
war-potential, mines etc. is more than helpful to decide what to do next. Not
knowing it... well.  You can send spies to any star in the galaxy. Be sure to
supply them with enough money to bribe or spend in any way necessary to soli-
cit the required information .  Not surprisingly, the enemy knows the  impor-
tance of knowledge too.  You can defend yourself in two ways:

1: Passively, by tightening up security on the planet  ("Black  out").   This
   will  make  it  harder for the enemy's spies to reveal the truth about the
   planet. They will have to spend more money, (and time) to get the informa-
   tion.  Nevertheless,  no planet can be totally secured against information
   leaks.
   
2: Actively, by investing money in counter-espionage.  This will NOT  prevent
   the  enemy's  spies  from getting the information, but as soon as he knows
   something, you will be notified exactly what  information  fell  into  the
   enemy's  hands.  Unfortunately,  this  counter-espionage is not spy-proof.
   The enemy can discover that  you  know  already  about  his  hard-acquired
   information  by investing in counter-counter-espionage. This can go on and
   on, but it seems that after a certain point, knowing that the enemy  KNOWS
   something  is of little importance, for the facts are (possibly) much dif-
   ferent by that time.
