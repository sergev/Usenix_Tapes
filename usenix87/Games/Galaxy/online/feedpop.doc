                     Fd - Feed the population.

     With this very general command you can make your people  happy,  content
and  highly motivated, or ill-tempered good-for-nothing slobs. Not only food,
but all the necessities are acquired with the money you put aside  with  this
command.  If  the available money does not suffice to feed the entire popula-
tion, the priority is: Fighters(f), scientists(s), builders(b), miners(m) and
slaves(v). Citizens support themselves, so there is no need to feed them.

     Format and examples:

fd 20               Invest 20 tellers to feed the population.
