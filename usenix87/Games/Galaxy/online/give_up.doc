                     Gu - Give up the game.

     If you feel that all is lost, or you got tired  of  the  game,  you  may
surrender.  Naturally, this will be considered a loss, and your opponent will
be credited for that. There is no "back up" to that  command,  so  make  sure
that this is truly your intention.
