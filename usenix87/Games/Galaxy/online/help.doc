                       GALAXY on_line HELP facilities

   If you are a complete novice, the wisest thing to do is to give
the "qt" command, wait for your opponent to agree, and read the game's 
documentation. It is found in /usr/doc under the name "galaxy"
   As it often happens, you know the command, but the weird syntax
escaped you. The "menu" command provides you with a brief description
of the available commands and their syntax.
   The part of the manual that describes fully a given command is 
obtained by typing "help <command name>". The command name is the FIRST
field in the "menu" output. (The word "man" can be used instead of "help").
   General information about various aspects of the game are obtained
by typing "help -<option>". The available options are:

   "intro"   -  Gives the fairy tale introduction to the game.
   "screen"  -  Explains the screen that you have first seen.
   "plnames" -  Gives the method by which names were assigned to planets.
   "map"     -  Shows an example to it.
   "moving"  -  Tells you how to move the cursor to any planet.
   "cons1","cons2","cons3" and "cons4"  -  Explain basic concepts of the game.
   "espionage","time","battle" and "capture" - Explain these issues.
   "prices"  -  What it takes to achieve something.
                 GALAXY wishes you a pleasent journey in the void.
