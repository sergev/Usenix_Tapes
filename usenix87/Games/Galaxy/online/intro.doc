               Galactical War - a new fascinating game for two
                                  players.

                              Mrdch and Amnnon

           You were a mighty king of a splendid galaxy,  reigning  your
      kingdom  in  peace  and  abundance for hundreds of years.  It all
      ended suddenly (and  sadly)  when  cruel  and  powerful  villains
      invaded your galaxy. You made a hasty retreat, managing to rescue
      only a small party of your most loyal subjects.  Not much of your
      enormous treasure was saved, and you had only a few ships left at
      your command. After years of wandering in the unimaginably  large
      universe,  you  stumble  upon a galaxy which appears uninhabited,
      yet suitable as a first move in attempting to regain your  glory.
      You  install your Capital at the center of the galaxy.  As a pre-
      caution you send patrol ships to explore  your  surroundings.  On
      their  return, they bring bad news.  In a nearby galaxy, there is
      another kingdom. You decide not to let another catastrophe happen
      to  you.   This  time,  you  are determined to destroy the enemy.
      Feeding your computer with all the  available  information  about
      this part of  the universe produces the result that you have just
      seen.
