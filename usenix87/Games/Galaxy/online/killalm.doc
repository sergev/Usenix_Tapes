                     Dm - Deactivate Anti-Landing-Mines (ALM).

     If you are at a short distance  from  a  mined  planet,  (one  traveling
planet  apart  in  ANY direction), you can try and deactivate the ALMs. It is
better to know in advance HOW MANY of those devices were laid on that planet,
in  order  to  deactivate them all.  Remember that even one ALM can destroy a
whole armada, if it tries to land. If the  mines were installed by  yourself,
you know their exact number and location, so that the deactivating process is
less expensive.

     Format and examples:

dm 2                Deactivate at current planet 2 ALMs.

dm c50 3            Deactivate at c50 3 ALMs.
