                     Mv - Move forces from planet to planet.
     This command enables you to move from planet to planet.  For  this  end,
you  specify  the  base planet, the destination planet, the direction and the
force to be moved.  You can travel with a single command to any  planet  that
is on a "straight" line.  For example, the following routes are possible:

     From c64 to l38, from r31 to r39, from l27 to l36 etc. 

     If it is possible to move from a given planet to another via  more  than
one  permissible route, the exact direction of movement may be specified. The
direction specification is done with the same  character  used  to  move  the
current  planet  pointer on the screen, preceded by the '>' character.
If direction is not given,  a  straight  line  direction  will  be chosen,
whenever possible.
If any Tk commands were given to the  base  planet,  the  people  and/or  the
material  specified will be moved with the force mentioned in the Mv command.
Note that the Mv command is in fact a LAND command on the destination planet.

     Format and examples: (Assuming that the current planet is l00)
mv -c31 3A             Move from current planet to c31 3 A-type HAWKs.
mv l3e - 3a            Move from l3e to the current planet 3 A-type HAWKs.
mv l24 -l20 >8 6A 4B C Move from l24 to l20 6 A-type, 4 B-type and 1  C-type,
                       going "north".
