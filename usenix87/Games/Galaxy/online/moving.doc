                          Moving the cursor.

     If the cursor is within one of the circles in a galaxy, you  can  either
move  along  the  circle's  radius,  or  along its perimeter.  As a rule, the
numerical keypad is used as a direction indicator. For example the '8' points
north,  the '6' east and the '1' south-west. The '.' will move you clockwise,
while the ',' counter-clockwise. The '5' key, which is in  the  middle,  will
flip over the page (if the terminal has this capability) so that the informa-
tion on the other side can be reexamined.  To visualize things  better,  here
is  the representation of the keypad, as used by the program. If the terminal
lacks keypad - use imagination.
                            7       8       9
                            4       5       6
                            1       2       3
     If the cursor is on one of the stars between the two galaxies,  you  can
move  to  all  directions but usually not diagonally.  (The allowed routes in
this area are marked on the map below).  If  a  key  other  then  numeric  is
pressed, this is interpreted as a character belonging to a command. Thereupon
the cursor will move down to the line marked 'Command: '. If at any time  you
wish  to  return  to the Map section, press the 'esc' key. To return back you
can either press the 'esc' key again, or simply continue  the  command.  (The
latter case holds only if the character typed is NOT numeric.)
