                      Nn - Ask for a break in game.

     The galaxy game tends to be rather long. If a break is needed, then giv-
ing  the  "Nn"  command  (NO  new year) the time will freeze.  While break is
activated, all commands are executable except for "Mv".  To  resume  playing,
use the "Ny" command.

     Format and examples:
nn
                       Ny - Ask for a new year.

     It may happen that you don't find anything useful to  perform  during  a
current GSY, and all you do is wait for it to end. By giving the "Ny" command
you can shorten this interval. Of course, in order  for  the  command  to  be
effective,  BOTH  players must agree by giving the same command. No report is
send to the enemy that you have  given  the  command,  so  that  each  player
decides  on  his  own.  In addition, this commands resumes a stopped game (by
"Nn").

     Format and examples:
ny
