                     Os - Report an Overall Statistics.
     At any time, you can ask for an overall evaluation  of  your  situation.
You will receive the statistics concerning your financial, military and popu-
lation position. You can add 1 or more characters to the command  (see  exam-
ples  below).  As  a result, the planets with the attribute specified in your
command will change their map representation so that  they  are  easily  dis-
tinguished from the rest. If the situation has changed since the last command
with the same parameters, the planet representation defaults to the  original
one.
Note that the characters can be combined. Especially useful is  the  combina-
tion  that  starts  with  'n'.   This  restores the whole map to the original
representation, so that any changes are easily noted.
