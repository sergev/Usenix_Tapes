                     Nd - Paint ship with anti detection paint.

     There is something you can do to prevent the enemy from  detecting  your
movement in hyper space. You can paint your ships with an Anti-Magnetic-Glare
paint. The effectiveness of this paint is proportional to the  no.  of  paint
layers.  The only drawback (apart from the money involved), is that the paint
wears off when traveling in hyper space.  To repaint the ships  you  have  to
land  first.  The detection probability is proportional to the AMG paint con-
dition compared with the strength of the detection devices.
Note that with the money provided the paint is only  purchased.   The  actual
painting  will  be  done  only  after the "Mv" command was given, so that the
paint will have the maximum effect. There is no paint  left  after  the  "Mv"
command execution.
