                     En - Enquire about a planet.
     Using this command you can  invest  money  in  espionage.  You  have  to
specify  the  planet,  the level of espionage, the specific issue of interest
and the amount of money dedicated to that purpose. Note that  some  espionage
assignments  are  easier  to carry out, and thus will require less money than
others.  The topics that can be subjects of enquiry are:
     The kind of planet (s),  planet's  population  (p),  planet's  knowledge
level (k), amount of metal (t), number and type of ships there (f), number of
ALMs installed (a), number and type of missiles (m).
     As for the level. Sending spies to  get  information  as  per  above  is
called "zero level" (it need not be specified). Setting counter-espionage for
that level is ALSO "zero  level".  When  the  enemy  wishes  to  establish  a
counter-counter-espionage  it  will  be  called  "first  level".  This  level
represents for the defender the  "counter-counter-counter-espionage"  and  so
on.
