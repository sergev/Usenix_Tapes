                     Ps - Report the Planet Situation.

     Information about any particular planet is also  always  available,  and
you  can  have  its  full  description  reported to you. The description will
include details on the properties of the planet, its  military  and  economic
situation and its inhabitants.  Of course, asking about a planet that doesn't
belong to you might result in very little information.  If espionage  reports
are needed, they should be explicitly requested.

     Format and examples:

ps                  Report about the planet under cursor (called "current").

ps i                Report espionage results in the current planet.

ps c50              Report about planet c50.

ps c50 i            Report espionage results in planet c50.
