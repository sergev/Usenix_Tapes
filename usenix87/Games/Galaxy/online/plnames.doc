                        How the planets are named

     Many commands require  the  specification  of  a  planet  on  which  the
intended  activity  is to take place.  By default, the planet that the cursor
is currently on - is the subject of the command. At any  time  you  can  have
it's  name  printed  on the command line by pressing cntr/p .  If you want to
specify another planet you can either move the cursor to it or give its coor-
dinates in Space:
The left galaxy is abbreviated L, the right R and the in-between region C. In
a  galaxy the circles are numbered 0-3, with the center at 0. The planets are
numbered 0-7 in circles 1-2 and 0-9 and a-f in circle 3. The  planet  at  the
hour-12  position  is  the  0  number,  and the rest have consecutive numbers
CLOCKWISE. In the center part, there are 7 rows of planets, numbered 0-6  top
to  bottom.  In each row there are 3 or 5 planets, numbered 0-4 LEFT to RIGHT
in the first and the last row, and 1-3 in the rest. 
To see an example of the  map with some  planets' names written  next to them
give the  "help -map"  command. The allowed  routes in the intergalaxy region
are marked there too.
