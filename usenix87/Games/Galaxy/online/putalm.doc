                     Lm - Lay out Anti-Landing-Mines (ALM).

     Any planet can be transformed into a deadly trap.  Laying down the mines
is  a costly action, not lesser then their deactivation.  In order to lay the
mine, (or mines), you have to LAND on the planet.  Only then can you  install
the mines. These devices become active one year after their installation. So,
you must leave immediately. Any human form remaining longer then a year  will
be totally disintegrated.

     Format and examples:

lm 2                Install on current planet 2 ALMs.

lm c50 3            Install on c50 3 ALMs.
