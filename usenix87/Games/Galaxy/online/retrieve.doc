                       Rt - Retrieve money given.

     Sometimes (too often) we all make typing mistakes.  This command enables
a  player  to recover from SOME of them.  If too much money was given to feed
the population(f), trade(t), blackout(b)  or  buiding  ships(s),  it  may  be
retrieved,  with  some  lose.  Note  that  these  are the only instances that
recovery is possible.
