                     Sv - Save the game.

     Since this is a game for two players, one session may not be enough  for
finishing the game. If one partner wishes to save the game
 and gives the "Sv"  command,  his  opponent  will  be  notified.   If  offer
accepted,  the  game will be saved.  (You need two to Tango.) If a "year" had
passed and no positive answer was given, then the TWO players have  to  agree
on  saving  the game.  If no parameter is given, the game will be saved under
the name "galaxy.save".  If a file name was specified, the game will be saved
under this name.

     Format and examples:
