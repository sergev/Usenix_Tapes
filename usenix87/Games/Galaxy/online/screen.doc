                              The screen.

     The screen is divided into two areas. The upper area  presents  the  map
shown  before. You  can  see  two galaxies. One is yours and the other is the
enemy's. Each galaxy consists of three nested circles of planets and the Cap-
ital in their center.  Between them there are some stars which (at the begin-
ning of the game) don't belong to either of you.  This  area  is  called  the
intergalactical area.  The lower part of the screen is used for communication
between you and your faithful Head of Administration.  All the  commands  are
given  to  him. He is the channel through which all the information to you is
reported, and all your commands properly delivered to your subjects scattered
throughout  the  galaxy.   The  information  that  is constantly kept updated
beneath the map is the name of the planet under cursor, the amount  of  money
left and the current year.  Another line is dedicated to messages sent to you
by the enemy and other information that is  reported  to  you.  Usually  this
information  is  independent  of  the  last  issued command. The messages are
displayed one after the other. It takes about three  commands  for  the  next
message  to  show  up,  but  if  the '-' key is pressed, the next message (if
existent) will be displayed immediately.   You  are  prompted  with  '-More-'
whenever   there  is  another  message waiting. Also note that the terminal's
bell rings when a new message has arrived.
