                     Sm - Set missiles.

     Missiles are defense weapons. Once installed on a planet, they cannot be
transferred  elsewhere.  They  can  intercept and destroy any enemy ship that
tries to land on that planet, as well as passing by ships. An A-type  missile
destroys  A-type ship , B-type missile destroys B-type ship etc.  B-type mis-
sile destroys 2 A-type ships, etc. As with ship construction,  the  knowledge
for  better  missiles should be available before any attempt at setting them.
Also, there must be enough soldiers to carry out the work.

     Installing missiles does not ensure their operation.   Their  activation
depends  on  detecting the enemy's movement. If not enough money was invested
in detecting devices, the enemy can even land on the planet without interfer-
ence from the missiles ( see the "dt" command for details).

     Format and examples:

sm 2a               Set on the current planet 3 A-type missiles.
sm c51 2a           Set on c51 2 A-type missiles.
sm c51 2a 4b        Set on c51 2 A-type and 4 B-type missiles.
