                     Tk - Take people or equipment.
     The Tk command enables you to take  people or equipment from a specified
planet  and  move  them  to another planet. If you intend to move people, you
specify their occupation and number.  An A-type HAWK can  carry  128  persons
(in  addition  to  the regular crew) a B-type HAWK carries 256 etc.  In addi-
tion, A-type HAWK can carry mining products sufficient to  build  another  A-
type HAWK.  To carry the material for a B-type HAWK, you need either 2 A-type
HAWKs or a B-type HAWK etc.  The amount of mining material  is  specified  by
A-type HAWKs quantities.  The only commodity that doesn't raise any transpor-
tation problems is knowledge. Any type HAWK can carry any type of  knowledge.
When  a  MOVE  command  is  given  (see Mv), the maximum amount of people and
material is loaded onto the departing ships.  The priority when loading  peo-
ple is given by the order specified in the Feed command. (see Fd) .
