                                 Time

     The GSY (Galactical Standard Year) is the time  reference  for  you  and
your enemy. Each GSY has 100 GSDs (Galactical Standard Day). The current time
is updated at the end of each command.  Some commands are carried out immedi-
ately,  while  other take time to be completed. The following events are time
consuming, and their effect is only evident at the end of the year:

     Tax payment, ALM activation, mining metals, buiding new ships, gathering
more knowledge, updating the population size and espionage reports.

     A GSY equals  about 3 minutes of Earth time.   However,  to  enable  the
players  to  speed  up things if they so wish, a NEW YEAR will arrive also in
case that BOTH players have given the "Ny" command (see the "Ny" command sec-
tion).
