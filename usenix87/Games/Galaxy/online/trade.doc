                     Tr - Invest in trade.

     Investing money in trade can be of great help. A good trading  year  can
bring  a 5-25 percent profit. The drawback is, of course, that the money will
be available only the NEXT year. The profit percent  highly  depends  on  the
number  of planets under your control.  If the number is higher than the ori-
ginal number, 0.5 percent is added per conquered planet.  If  not,  you  will
have the minimal profit only.
