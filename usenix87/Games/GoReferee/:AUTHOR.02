For those of you that missed the initial posting of these sources,
congratulations!  The first posting had several bugs; in particular,
a test program was included that simulated the actions of many GO programs
all too faithfully; i.e. it commits suicide.

I'm reposting the entire thing, so if you grabbed the first posting, you can
simply overwrite it with this version and not worry about what has to change
and what doesn't.  The documentation has also been brought up to date.
