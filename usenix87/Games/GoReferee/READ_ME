GO Referee distribution		4/86

These are the components of the GO referee used for the Usenix GO Tournaments.
Since these are sources they should work on almost any system.
The one system-specific module is "SUBS/utime.c"; it's set up for BSD systems.
If you have a non-BSD system you'll have to hack it (good luck).

There are two subdirectories;
	SUBS contains source files to build the archive "gosub.a"
	GREF contains source files for the referee itself

After unbundling the files, cd into SUBS and say "make".  This will create
the "gosub.a" archive used by the referee (and also potentially useful for
your own programs).

Then cd into GREF and say "make".  This will make "gref", the referee,
"gotst", a random GO player for testing the referee, and will ry to print
the gref document (check the Makefile to be sure it's saying the right
things for your system; note that it uses PIC).

Note also that gref must be able to read /dev/kmem to do program timings;
if it can't it will go ahead, but show no timings.

Good luck.  Let me know of any bugs, as always.
