	The files in this directory make up the daemon for mazewar.

	The purpose of the daemon is very simple - it facilitates the
	forwarding of packets between mazewar players.  The daemon is
	designed to do as little processing as possible, and therefore
	to be able to have the best response possible.  All processing
	of whether or not a shot has hit or a move is legal is done
	at the user level.

	I used a datagram implementation for this program, and the
	benefits of this are questionable.  On the one hand, the code
	implementation is cleaner than a virtual circuit implementation,
	but packet loss becomes a reality on severly loaded networks.
	During initial play testing, little or not packet loss occurred
	between VAXen on a three megabyte Ethernet, but there did seem
	to be noticable loss over our SUN network.

	The advantage of datagrams is that they are faster than connected
	sockets.  Our rational for going with the datagram implementation
	is that after the initial array of user structs, each packet
	is relatively insignificant, and each packet contains enough
	state information to make up for any lost packets.  Speed, therefore,
	was chosen over reliability.

	This wonderful code was written by Nick Lai at UC Berkeley, 1984.
