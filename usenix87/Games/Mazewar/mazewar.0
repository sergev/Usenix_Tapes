    This is a source distribution of the multi-player, multi-cpu game
"Mazewar", written by Chris Guthrie, Nick Lai, and John Coker, all of the
University of California, Berkeley.  It can be run on machines of
the VAX family under 4.2 BSD UNIX, and on SUN workstations running
4.2 BSD UNIX.  Mazewar supports both a regular ASCII mode for normal
terminals, and a SUN graphics mode.

    Permission is granted to modify the src for your own use, but it
may not be redistributed without permission of the authors.  Any changes
to the source must be accompanied by the authors' names.

    We would appreciate letters about any bugs or changes you may make.

    This is a four-part distribution.  You will get separate letters
for each part.  Each letter is a shar; extract with 'sh <filename>'.
When you make the game, extract the directories (each letter will create
and fill a directory) in any order, but make the daemon first as the usr
program uses two files from the daemon directory.

    Good Luck!
