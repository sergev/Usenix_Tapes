		MAZEWAR USER PROGRAM INSTALATION

    The graphics for this game were written under the SUN
4.2 os and graphics 1.1 release.  The game runs outside of
the suntools window manager program.  Since the game makes
of the pixrect graphics, ic CAN'T run under suntools without
major hacking.

    The ascii (non-graphics) version is the default (and only
possible way) on non-SUNs.  Use 'make sun' for the SUN version
and 'make' or 'make vax' for the VAX 4.2 version.

    The program basically talks to the daemon and gets info
on each player as the move or change direction.  Each player
decides if he dies, and, if so, transmits this info to the
player who killed him.

    The daemon and user program have a 'Version Number' ascociated
with them.  If the daemon's version number is higher than the usr
program's, the usr program will die with an appropriate error message.
The daemon's version is established by the program newvers, run in
the daemon directory.

   Bugs should be directed to Chris Guthrie.
