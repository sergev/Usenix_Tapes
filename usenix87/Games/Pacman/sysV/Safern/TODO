- Make the fruit appear and go away
- Fix the bug that sometimes causes wierd characters floating around
  (something to do with the tunnel, the monster gets its mo_name mixed up)
  (Note: haven't seen this one in quite a while, it might be fixed.)
- Possibly combine pm_roll and pm_user into one file
- Test on BSD4.3.
