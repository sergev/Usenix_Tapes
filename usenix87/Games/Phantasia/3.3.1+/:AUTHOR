Well folks, here as promised is the source to my twiddled version of
Ted Estes' Phantasia.  I got over 60 requests for source, so am posting.

In my first announcement I forgot to include my postal address for those who'd
like the manual page, monster list, and map (send $2 and a self-addressed
mailing label or an address I can tape on an envelope, or $1 and a 9"x12"
stamped self-addressed envelope);  here it is:

		Ms. Christine Robertson,
		225 Berkeley St.,
		Toronto, Onatario
		CANADA   M5A 2X3

The changes to this version are summarized in the README file and at
the beginning of main.c.  I have supplied a Makefile derived from Ted's
Makefile.noxstr (xstr steadfastly refuses to function on my machine);
there are substantial differences in organization from the original
Makefiles.  I believe this Makefile should work with essentially all
versions of make, since it does nothing fancy.

To install the new Phantasia, unshar the files, edit the Makefile to
configure things for your own system, and run "make install".
(For those running 4.2BSD, you will need to edit func1.c and un-comment
out the calls to SIGTSTP etc.-- see the Makefile.)

NOTE that the characs files are NOT COMPATIBLE between the last version
(3.3.1) and this one (3.3.1+);  included in the distribution is a
conversion program which "make install" runs, saving your old characs
file as "characs.orig".

Another program, "map.c", is included for those running "plot" with
any decent sort of output device.  It draws a nice circular map of the
inner 5 circles, with the regions named.  We have a little HP plotter here
which does a lovely job.

Good luck, and enjoy!  (Please pass any flames through me first, as I
don't want Ted bugged for things he didn't do.)
