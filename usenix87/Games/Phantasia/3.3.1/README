This is the latest version of Phantasia.  It incorporates all the reported
bug fixes to date.  The only problem that may arise is the test for
RAND in 'setup.c'.  If you have problems with it complaining, even
though the correct RAND is specified, simply delete it.

Please send me any bugs you may find, but PLEASE be specific.  I cannot
correct a bug which is described as:

    "When I choose a character type, it blows up."
    (What blows up?  What exactly was printed at the terminal?
    Which character type was chosen?  Etc. . . ?)

Also, please tell me which version of UN*X you are running, and upon
which type of hardware.

I will also do my best to help anyone with problems just trying to
get the game running.  Again, I need to know which flavor of UN*X
and what type of CPU.  Also, a copy of the output from 'make'
would be extremely useful.

Any and all ideas/suggestions/additions are more than welcome.  If
you feel strongly enough about it, write the change and send it to me,
and I will do my best to incorporate it in the next version of Phantasia.
Otherwise, I will give serious thought to adding it myself.

Follow the directions in the Makefile carefully to set up the game.
Read the comments at the beginning of 'main.c', if you haven't already.

Enjoy.
