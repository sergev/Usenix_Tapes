# Makefile for Phantasia 3.3
#
# Use this makefile if you don't have 'xstr'.  Use the other makefile if you do.
# To create game:
#
# 1)  Set up a directory where the game and its support files will live.
#        (It is suggested that the source be kept somewhere else.)
# 2)  Set up the variables in Makefile to reflect your particular situation.
# 3)  Check out ok_to_play() at the end of main.c if you want to include
#        code to restrict access at certain times.
# 4)  'make install' and watch it fly.  It is important to run 'setup' before
#	 trying to run 'phantasia'.  The install procedure does this for you.

CFLAGS =	-O

# DEST is where the program and its support files reside
DEST =		/usr/games/lib/phantasia

# The following are program constants which are implementation dependent.
#
# PATH is the same as $DEST.
# WIZARD is the login of the one who will clean up things.
# UID is the uid of game wizard.
# RAND is one more than the largest number generated by rand().
#	Possible values for this are:
#		32768.0		(for 15 bit rand())
#		65536.0		(for 16 bit rand())
#		2147483648.0	(for 31 bit rand())
# ACCESS is fopen() access to open a file for writing, but no
#	clearing the file,  e.g. "a", or "r+".  (Use "r+" if you have it.)
# define OK_TO_PLAY to restrict playing access.  Also see function ok_to_play()
#	in main.c, and tailor to your own needs.
# define ENEMY to include code for checking of a 'hit list' of resricted 
#	accounts.  The list of logins goes in the file 'enemy'.
# define BSD41 for 4.1bsd
# define BSD42 for 4.2bsd
# define SYS3 for System III, or similar
# define SYS5 for System V
# define SMALL to save a little space (omits wormholes)
# If you don't have 'strchr()', put '-Dstrchr=index' below.
