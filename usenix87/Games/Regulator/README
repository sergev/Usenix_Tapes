	Most people have already probally done this by hand or wrote
the shell script to do this-- But just in case I can save you a
little time... here it is.

	The two shell scripts included are for use with the
Game Regulator recenly posted to mod.sources.  The script called
makelinks.sh should be executed from within the games directory to
make the links for that directory.  THIS MUST BE EDITED and you
must specify the location of the Game Regulator.

Usage:
makelinks.sh [files ...]

	The other shell script called "install.sh" is to install
new versions of the Game Regulator.  It copys the new GR to its spot
and redoes all the links.

Usage:
install.sh [directory links are in] [path of new GR] [path of old GR]
