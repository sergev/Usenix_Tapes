    In this subdirectory is a sample dungeon creator. The basic
idea is that a dungeon is made up of Corridors, Doors, Rooms, and
Creatures that inhabit them.  A corridor can have creatures, doors,
and traps, whereas doors can have corridors or closets or rooms
behind them.  A room can have some exits, a trap, and possibly a 
monster or treasure.  Creatures have attributes, possessions and
weapons.  Creatures sometimes come up with weird combinations of
weapons, such as a floating eye using a long sword, if this occurs,
consider it part of the treasure instead.  

    Note that I have adopted a convention that table files start 
with a capital letter, and subtable files are lower-case.  This helps
to remember which can be used as input files.  

The tables (input files):

    Corridor - The main table, this will create the next section of
		a dungeon corridor.

    Creature - If you need another monster, use this table.

    Door     - Use this to describe the doors in a room, to expand
		the dungeon that way.

    Room     - Use this to describe an extra room thrown in for good
   		 measure.

    Try it - You'll like it.  If you make any enhancements to this,
please let me know.  I hope you enjoy this and take it as an Aid -
not the end-all of dungeon creation.  Enjoy!
