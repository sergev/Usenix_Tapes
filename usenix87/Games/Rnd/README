Hi all you net-people!

[I know it's been a long time, but ... ]

    When I saw Marcus Ranum's Random stuff generator, I thought
it was a novel idea, but limiting.  I wanted a way to nest tables
and subtables in the subtables themselves.  So I have done that.
It was fairly simple to do, (a tribute to Marcus for easily
modified code) just change the 'dohack()' call in 'dosubtable' to
a 'doparse()' call instead (after stripping off the number).

    This greatly extends the possibilities of the system, but
makes it much more likely to blow your stack due to recursion.
But if you are careful, it should work.

    I also added a few 'features' - there is a default of 10
iterations if you hit C/R, each roll of the dice uses the 'best
of three tries, and the stat command has been modified as follows:

    If you put an '*' as the first character of the stat string,
the printout will be in an alternate format, i.e.
	stat Gold 3 100           would produce=>  Gold: 230
	stat *Gold_pieces 3 100   would produce=>  160 Gold_pieces

    Also included is a subdirectory Dungeon, which uses these new
features to create random sections of dungeon corridors.  It is
based loosely on a Dungeon Generator article in a magazine I saw
many moons ago (I don't remember which).  Look it over and see
what you can do with it.

    I've lost the E-Mail address of Marcus, so I hope he sees
this and approves of the changes I've made.  I also hope everyone
else can use this to further your Dungeon endeavors.
