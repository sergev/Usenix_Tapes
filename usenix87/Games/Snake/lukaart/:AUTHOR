Happy New Year to Everyone! I was taking a leisure time break when I suddenly
realized a small enhancement could be made to "worm".  Snake has a cute little
serpentine head that points in the direction you're going, after the snake
wakes up and starts stalking his food.  Apart from flushing buffers at the end
so you won't lose your score, this is the only real change.  The whole source
is here in case you didn't already have it.  Don't forget to remove the
.signature at the end. 

So long, and thanks for all the fish.
