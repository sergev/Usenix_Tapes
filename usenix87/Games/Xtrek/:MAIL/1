Xtrek, an X based multiplayer space game, was released with the
X10.4 distribution.  Since that point we've spent some time adding
features, fixing bugs, and making the game more robust.

The game is available via anonymous ftp from scam.berkeley.edu
(128.32.132.43) in src/xtrek.tar.  This version compiles directly
under Ultrix and SUN 3.2.  It requires one sysV shared memory.
The 4.2bsd system calls are rare and not essential for the game
to run, so with minor mods, it should compile on other machines.

The following options/features have been added.
	command line flags allow you to watch and play with other players.
	The defending robots are now very tough.
	Players can invoke practice robots which are easier to kill.
	A help window with commands listed is available.
	A complicated set of war settings are available so you can team up.
	Combat has been modified at bit to make skill more important.
	The document has been updated to cover new features.
	The game no longer gets an X error at random times.
	The daemon has been optimised to reduce loading.

Have fun.
