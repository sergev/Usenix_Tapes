	FORTRAN ZORK

	The UNIX directory contains C support routines for running this ZORK
under the UNIX OS.  The TOPS20 directory contains the MACRO20 support
routines for running ZORK under TOPS20.  NOTE: Getting ZORK to run under
UNIX never got any further than creating the support routines.

	Originally there was a file called dtext.txt which was nearly identical
to zork.txt.  The exact differences are in the file 'diffs' which is the
output of a 'diff -c zork.txt dtext.txt'.
