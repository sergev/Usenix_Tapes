4,Useful commands:
4,
4,   The 'BRIEF' command suppresses printing of long room descriptions
4,for rooms which have been visited.  The 'SUPERBRIEF' command suppresses
4,printing of long room descriptions for all rooms.  The 'VERBOSE'
4,command restores long descriptions.
4,   The 'INFO' command prints information which might give some idea
4,of what the game is about.
4,   The 'QUIT' command prints your score and asks whether you wish
4,to continue playing.
4,   The 'SAVE' command saves the state of the game for later continuation.
4,   The 'RESTORE' command restores a saved game.
4,   The 'INVENTORY' command lists the objects in your possession.
4,   The 'LOOK' command prints a description of your surroundings.
4,   The 'SCORE' command prints your current score and ranking.
4,   The 'TIME' command tells you how long you have been playing.
4,   The 'RNAME' command prints the name of the room you are currenly in
4,   The 'DIAGNOSE' command reports on your injuries, if any.
4,
4,Containment:
4,
4,   Some objects can contain other objects.  Many such containers can
4,be opened and closed.  The rest are always open.   They may or may
4,not be transparent.  For you to access (e.g., take) an object
4,which is in a container, the container must be open.  For you
4,to see such an object, the container must be either open or
4,transparent.  Containers have a capacity, and objects have sizes;
4,the number of objects which will fit therefore depends on their
4,sizes.  You may PUT any object you have access to (it need not be
4,in your hands) into any other object.  At some point, the program
4,will attempt to pick it up if you don't already have it, which
4,process may fail if you're carrying too much.  Although containers
4,can contain other containers, the program doesn't access more than
4,one level down.
4,
4,Fighting:
4,
4,   Occupants of the dungeon will, as a rule, fight back when
4,attacked.  In some cases, they may attack even if unprovoked.
4,Useful verbs here are 'ATTACK <villain> WITH <weapon>', 'KILL',
4,etc.  Knife-throwing may or may not be useful.  You have a
4,fighting strength which varies with time.  Being in a fight,
4,getting killed, and being injured all lower this strength.
4,Your carrying capacity may also be reduced after a fight.  
4,Strength is regained with time.  Thus, it is not a good idea to
4,fight someone immediately after being killed.  Other details
4,should become apparent after a few melees or deaths.
4,
4,Command parser:
4
4,   A command is one line of text terminated by a carriage return.
4,For reasons of simplicity, all words are distinguished by their
4,first six letters.  All others are ignored.  For example, typing
4,'DISASSEMBLE THE ENCYCLOPEDIA' is not only meaningless, it also
4,creates excess effort for your fingers.  Note that this trunca-
4,tion may produce ambiguities in the intepretation of longer words.
4,
4,   You are dealing with a fairly stupid parser, which understands
4,the following types of things--
4,
4,   Actions:
4,	Among the more obvious of these, such as TAKE, PUT, DROP, etc.
4,	Fairly general forms of these may be used, such as PICK UP,
4,	PUT DOWN, etc.
4,
4,   Directions:
4,	NORTH, SOUTH, UP, DOWN, etc. and their various abbreviations.
4,	Other more obscure directions (LAND, CROSS) are appropriate in
4,	only certain situations.
4,
4,   Objects:
4,	Most objects have names and can be referenced by them.
4,
4,   Adjectives:
4,	Some adjectives are understood and required when there are
4,	two objects which can be referenced with the same 'name' (e.g.,
4,	DOORs, BUTTONs).
4,
4,   Prepositions:
4,	It may be necessary in some cases to include prepositions, but
4,	the parser attempts to handle cases which aren't ambiguous
4,	without.  Thus 'GIVE CAR TO DEMON' will work, as will 'GIVE DEMON
4,	CAR'.  'GIVE CAR DEMON' probably won't do anything interesting.
4,	When a preposition is used, it should be appropriate;  'GIVE CAR
4,	WITH DEMON' won't parse.
4,
4,   Sentences:
4,	The parser understands a reasonable number of syntactic construc-
4,	tions.  In particular, multiple commands (separated by commas)
4,	can be placed on the same line.
4,
4,   Ambiguity:
4,	The parser tries to be clever about what do do in the case of
4,	actions which require objects that are not explicitly specified.
4,	If there is only one possible object, the parser will assume
4,	that is should be used.  Otherwise, the parser will ask.
4,	Most questions asked by the parser can be answered.
5,Welcome to Dungeon!
5,
5,   You are near a large dungeon, which is reputed to contain vast
5,quantities of treasure.   Naturally, you wish to acquire some of it.
5,In order to do so, you must of course remove it from the dungeon.  To
5,receive full credit for it, you must deposit it safely in the trophy
5,case in the living room of the house.
5,
5,   In addition to valuables, the dungeon contains various objects
5,which may or may not be useful in your attempt to get rich.  You may
5,need sources of light, since dungeons are often dark, and weapons,
5,since dungeons often have unfriendly things wandering about.  Reading
5,material is scattered around the dungeon as well;  some of it
5,is rumored to be useful.
5,
5,   To determine how successful you have been, a score is kept.
5,When you find a valuable object and pick it up, you receive a
5,certain number of points, which depends on the difficulty of finding
5,the object.  You receive extra points for transporting the treasure
5,safely to the living room and placing it in the trophy case.  In
5,addition, some particularly interesting rooms have a value associated
5,with visiting them.  The only penalty is for getting yourself killed,
5,which you may do only twice.
5,
5,   Of special note is a thief (always carrying a large bag) who
5,likes to wander around in the dungeon (he has never been seen by the
5,light of day).  He likes to take things.  Since he steals for pleasure
5,rather than profit and is somewhat sadistic, he only takes things which
5,you have seen.  Although he prefers valuables, sometimes in his haste
5,he may take something which is worthless.  From time to time, he examines
5,his take and discards objects which he doesn't like.  He may occas-
5,ionally stop in a room you are visiting, but more often he just wanders
5,through and rips you off (he is a skilled pickpocket).
6,Please answer the question.
7,You clearly are a suicidal maniac.  We don't allow psychotics in the
7,dungeon, since they may harm other adventurers.  Your remains will be
7,installed in the land of the living dead, where your fellow adventurers
7,may gloat over them.
8,What?  You don't trust me?  Why, only last week I patched a running
8,RSX system and it survived for over thirty seconds.  Oh, well.
9,Now let me see...
9,Well, we weren't quite able to restore your state.  You can't have
9,everything.
10,Do you wish me to try to patch you?
11,You are behind the white house.  In one corner of the house
11,there is a window which is #.
12,open
13,slightly ajar
14,You are in the kitchen of the white house.  A table seems to have
14,been used recently for the preparation of food.  A passage leads to
14,the west and a dark staircase can be seen leading upward.  To the
14,east is a small window which is #.
15,You are in the living room.  There is a door to the east.  To the west
15,is a wooden door with strange gothic lettering, which appears to be
15,nailed shut.
16,You are in the living room.  There is a door to the east.  To the west
16,is a cyclops-shaped hole in an old wooden door, above which is some
16,strange gothic lettering.
17,In the center of the room is a large oriental rug.
18,In the center of the room is a closed trap door.
19,In the center of the room is an open trap door.
20,There is a rug lying next to an open trap door.
21,You are in a dark and damp cellar with a narrow passageway leading
21,east, and a crawlway to the south.  To the west is the bottom of a
21,steep metal ramp which is unclimbable.
22,The door crashes shut, and you hear someone barring it.
23,You are in a small room near the maze.  There are twisty
23,passages in the immediate vicinity.
24,Above you is a grating locked with a skull-and-crossbones lock.
25,Above you is an open grating with sunlight pouring in.
26,Above you is a grating.
27,You are in a clearing, with a forest surrounding you on the west
27,and south.
28,There is a grating securely fastened into the ground.
29,There is an open grating descending into darkness.
30,A grating appears on the ground.
31,You are in a long room on the south shore of a large reservoir.
32,You are in a long room, to the north of which was formerly a
32,reservoir.  However, with the water level lowered, there is merely
32,a wide stream running through the center of the room.
33,There is a western exit, a passageway south, and a steep pathway
33,climbing up along the edge of a cliff.
34,You are on the reservoir.  Beaches can be seen north and south.
34,Upstream a small stream enters the reservoir through a narrow
34,cleft in the rocks.  The dam can be seen downstream.
35,You are on what used to be a large reservoir, but which is now a
35,large mud pile.  There are 'shores' to the north and south.
36,You are in a large cavernous room, north of a large reservoir.
37,You are in a large cavernous room, to the south of which was formerly
37,a reservoir.  However, with the water level lowered, there is merely
37,a wide stream running through the center of the room.
38,There is a tunnel leaving the room to the north.
39,You are in a large room with giant icicles hanging from the walls
39,and ceiling.  There are passages to the north and east.
40,Part of the glacier has been melted.
41,There is a large passageway leading westward.
42,You are in a large square room with tall ceilings.  There are exits
42,on the north, east, and west sides of the room.  On the south wall is
42,an enormous mirror which fills the entire wall.
43,Unfortunately, you have managed to destroy it by your reckless
43,actions.
44,		BOOOOOOOOOM
45,You are in large room which seems to be air conditioned.  In one
45,corner there is a machine (?) which is shaped somewhat like a clothes
45,dryer.  On the 'panel' there is a switch which is labelled in an
45,obscure dialect of Swahili.  Fortunately, I know this dialect, and the
45,label translates to 'START'.  The switch does not appear to be manip-
45,ulable by any human hand (unless the fingers are about 1/16 by 1/4
45,inch).  On the front of the machine is a large lid, which is #.
46,closed
47,The cave is very windy at the moment, and your candles have blown out.
48,You are in a small room that has only one door, to the east.
49,In the corner of the room on the ceiling is a large vampire bat who
49,is obviously deranged and holding his nose.
50,A deranged vampire bat (a reject from WUMPUS) swoops down
50,from the ceiling and lifts you away...
51,You are at the periphery of a large dome, which forms the ceiling
51,of another room below.  Protecting you from a precipitous drop is a
51,wooden railing which circles the dome.
52,Hanging down from the railing is a rope which ends about ten feet
52,from the floor below.
53,I'm afraid that the leap you attempted has done you in.
54,You are in a large room with a prominent doorway leading to a down
54,staircase.  To the west is a narrow twisting tunnel.  Above you is a
54,large dome painted with scenes depicting elvish hacking rites.  Up
54,around the edge of the dome (20 feet up) is a wooden railing.  In the
54,center of the room there is a white marble pedestal.
55,A large piece of rope descends from the railing above, ending some
55,five feet above your head.
56,You are in a circular room with passages off in eight directions.
57,Your compass needle spins wildly, and you cannot get your bearings.
58,According to Prof. TAA of MIT Tech, the rapidly changing magnetic
58,fields in the room are so intense as to cause you to be electrocuted.
58,I really don't know, but in any event, something has killed you.
59,You are outside a large gateway, on which is inscribed:
59,
59,	"Abandon every hope, all ye who enter here."
59,
59,The gate is open.  Through it you can see a desolation, with a pile of
59,mangled corpses in one corner.  Thousands of voices, lamenting some
59,hideous fate, can be heard.
60,The way through the gate is barred by evil spirits, who jeer at your
60,attempts to pass.
61,There is a clap of thunder, and a voice echoes through the
61,cavern:  "Begone, chomper!"  Apparently, the voice thinks you
61,are an evil spirit and dismisses you from the land of the living.
62,You are not equipped for an exorcism.
63,There is a clap of thunder, and a voice echoes through the
63,cavern:  "Begone, fiends!"  The spirits, sensing the presense
63,of a greater power, flee through the walls.
64,You have entered the land of the living dead, a large desolate
64,room.  Although it is apparently uninhabited, you can hear the
64,sounds of thousands of lost souls weaping and moaning.  In
64,the east corner are stacked the remains of dozens of previous
64,adventurers who were less fortunate than yourself.  To the east
64,is an ornate passage, apparently recently constructed.
65,amid the desolation, you spot what appears to be your head,
65,tastefully impaled on the end of a long pole.
66,You are standing on the top of flood control dam #3, which was
66,quite a tourist attraction in times far distant.  There are paths
66,to the north, south, east, and down.
67,The sluice gates on the dam are closed.  Behind the dam, there can
67,be seen a wide lake.  A small stream is formed by the runoff from
67,the lake.
68,It appears that the dam has been opened, since the water level behind
68,the dam is low and the sluice gate is open.  Water is rushing down-
68,stream through the gates.
69,There is a control panel here.  There is a large metal bolt on the
69,panel.  Above the bolt is a small green plastic bubble.
70,The green bubble is glowing.
71,The water level is now up to your ankles.
72,The water level is now up to your shins.
73,The water level is now up to your knees.
74,The water level is now up to your hips.
75,The water level is now up to your waist.
76,The water level is now up to your chest.
77,The water level is now up to your neck.
78,The water level is now over your head.
79,The water level is now high in your lungs.
80,The room is full of water and cannot be entered.
81,I'm afraid you have done drowned yourself.
82,You hear a scream of anguish as you violate the robber's hideaway.
82,Using passages unknown to you, he rushes to its defense.
83,The thief gestures mysteriously, and the treasures in the room
83,suddenly vanish.
84,Something seems funny about the feel of the buoy.
85,Oh dear, you seem to have gone over Aragain Falls.  Not a very
85,smart thing to do, apparently.
86,You seem to be digging a hole here.
87,The hole is getting deeper, but that's about it.
88,You are surrounded by a wall of sand on all sides.
89,You can see a small statue in the sand.
90,The wall collapses, smothering you.
91,There is nothing to dig into here.
92,You are digging into a pile of bat guano.
93,You seem to be getting knee deep in guano.
94,You are covered with bat turds, cretin.
95,This is getting you nowhere.
96,You are at the top of Aragain Falls, an enormous waterfall with a
96,drop of about 450 feet.  The only path here is on the north end.
96,There is a man-sized barrel here which you could fit into.
97,A beautiful rainbow can be seen over the falls and to the east.
98,A solid rainbow spans the falls.
99,According to Prof. TAA of MIT Tech, the rapidly changing magnetic
99,fields in the room are so intense as to fry all the delicate innards
99,of the robot.  I really don't know, but in any event, smoke is coming
99,out of its ears, and it has stopped moving.
100,You are on a wide ledge high into the volcano.  The rim of the
100,volcano is about 200 feet above and there is a precipitous drop
100,below to the floor.
101,The way to the south is blocked by rubble.
102,There is a small door to the south.
103,The way to the south is blocked by rubble.
104,You are in a dusty old room which is virtually featureless, except
104,for an exit on the north size.
105,Imbedded in the far wall is a rusty old box.  It appears that
105,the box is somewhat damaged, since an oblong hole has been
105,chipped out of the front of it.
106,On the far wall is a rusty box, whose door has been blown off.
107,You are in a room with a low ceiling which is circular in shape.
107,There are exits to the east and southeast.
108,As you enter, your compass starts spinning wildly.
109,The ledge has collapsed and cannot be landed on.
110,The ledge collapses, giving you a narrow escape.
111,The force of the explosion has caused the ledge to collapse belatedly.
112,The ledge collapses, leaving you with no place to land.
113,The ledge collapses, probably as a result of the explosion.  A large
113,chunk of it, which is attached to the hook, drags you down to the
113,ground.  Fatally.
114,The way is blocked by debris from an explosion.
115,You may recall your recent explosion.  Well, probably as a result of
115,that, you hear an ominous rumbling, as if one of the rooms in the
115,dungeon has collapsed.
116,The room trembles and 50,000 pounds of rock fall on you,
116,turning you into a pancake.
117,The house shakes, and the ceiling of the room you're in collapses,
117,turning you into a pancake.
118,A volcano gnome seems to walk straight out of the wall and says,
118,"I have a very busy appointment schedule and little time to waste on
118,trespassers, but for a very small fee, I'll show you the way out."
118,You notice that the gnome is nervously glancing at his watch.
119,Suddenly a sinister, wraithlike figure, cloaked and hooded, appears
119,seeming to float in the air before you.  In a low, almost inaudible
119,voice he says, "I welcome you to the ranks of the chosen of Zork.  You
119,have persisted through many trials and tests and have overcome them
119,all.  One such as yourself is fit to join even the implementers!"
119,He then raises his oaken staff and, chuckling, drifts away like a
119,wisp of smoke, his laughter fading in the distance.
120,
121,Unfortunately, it is impossible to tell directions in here.
122,The slag turns out to be rather insubstantial and crumbles into dust
122,at your touch.  It must not have been very valuable.
123,The lid opens.
124,The lid closes.
125,Look around.
126,You think it isn't?
127,I think you've already done that.
128,The trophy case is securely fastened to the wall (perhaps to foil any
128,attempt by robbers to remove it).
129,The bottle hits the far wall and is decimated.
130,The basket is at the other end of the chain.
131,A brilliant maneuver destroys the bottle.
132,The water splashes on the walls and evaporates immediately.
133,The water spills to the floor and evaporates immediately.
134,It is not tied to anything.
135,There is nothing it can be tied to.
136,The rope is already attached.
137,The rope drops over the side and comes within ten feet of the floor.
138,It is not tied to anything.
139,Although you tied it incorrectly, the rope becomes free.
140,The rope drops gently to the floor below.
141,The rope is tied to the railing.
142,The lamp has smashed into the floor, and the light has gone out.
143,The rug is too heavy to lift, but in trying to raise it you
143,notice an irregularity beneath it.
144,The rug is extremely heavy and cannot be carried.
145,With a great effort, the rug is moved to one side of the room.
145,With the rug moved, the dusty cover of a closed trap door appears.
146,Having moved the carpet previously, you find it impossible
146,to move it again.
147,You are stopped by a cloud of poisonous gas.
148,Time passes... and you die from some obscure poisoning.
149,The gnome glances at his watch.  "Oops!  I'm late for an
149,an appointment."  He disappears, leaving you alone on the shelf.
150,Now you've done it.  It seems that the brick has other properties
150,than weight, namely the ability to blow you to smithereens.
151,There is an explosion nearby.
152,The wire rapidly burns into nothing.
153,The match has gone out.
154,The lamp appears to be getting dimmer.
155,The lamp is dying.
156,The candles grow short.
157,The candles are very short.
158,The leaves burn and the neighbors start to complain.
159,The sight of someone carrying a pile of burning leaves so offends
159,the neighbors that they come over and put you out.
160,As you pick up the rusty knife, your sword gives a single pulse
160,of blinding blue light.
161,As the knife approaches its victim, your mind is submerged by an
161,overmastering will.  Slowly, your hand turns, until the rusty blade
161,is an inch from your neck.  The knife seems almost to sing as it
161,savagely cuts your throat.
162,A ghost appears in the room and is appalled by your desecration
162,of the remains of a fellow adventurer.  He casts a curse on
162,all of your valuables and orders them banished to the land of
162,the living dead.  The ghost leaves, muttering obscenities.
163,There is a rumble from deep within the earth, and the room shakes.
164,There is an ugly person staring at you.
165,The mirror is broken into many pieces.
166,Nobody but a greedy surgeon would allow you to attempt that trick.
167,You have broken the mirror.  I hope you have a seven years supply of
167,good luck available.
168,Haven't you done enough already?
169,The torch hits the glacier and explodes into a great ball of flame,
169,devouring the glacier.  The water from the melting glacier rushes
169,downstream, carrying the torch with it.  In place of the glacier,
169,there is a passageway leading west.
170,The melting glacier seems to have carried the torch away, leaving
170,you in the dark.
171,The glacier is unmoved by your ridiculous attempt.
172,Part of the glacier melts, drowning you under a torrent of water.
173,burned out ivory torch
174,There is a burned out ivory torch here.
175,The basket is raised to the top of the shaft.
176,The basket is lowered to the bottom of the shaft.
177,The cage is securely fastened to the iron chain.
178,You seem unable to affect these spirits.
179,How can you attack a spirit with material objects?
180,The book is open to page 569.
181,As hard as you try, the book cannot be closed.
182,A booming voice says, "Wrong, cretin!", and you notice that you
182,have turned into a pile of dust.
183,I'm afraid that you have run out of matches.
184,One of the matches starts to burn.
185,The match is out.
186,The tube refuses to accept anything.
187,The cyclops yawns and stares at the thing that woke him.
188,The cyclops, tired of all your games and trickery, eats you.
188,The cyclops says, "Mmm mmm!  Just like mom used to make 'em."
189,The cyclops says, "Mmm mmm!  I love hot peppers!  But oh, could I use
189,a drink.  Perhaps I could drink the blood of that thing."  From the
189,gleam in his eye, it could be surmised that you are 'that thing'.
190,The cyclops looks tired and quickly falls fast asleep (what did you
190,put in that drink, anyway?).
191,The cyclops is apparently not thirsty at the moment and refuses
191,your generous gesture.
192,The cyclops may be hungry, but there is a limit.
193,The cyclops is not so stupid as to eat that!
194,The cyclops seems somewhat agitated.
195,The cyclops appears to be getting more agitated.
196,The cyclops is moving about the room, looking for something.
197,The cyclops was looking for salt and pepper.  I think he is gathering
197,condiments for his upcoming snack.
198,The cyclops is moving toward you in an unfriendly manner.
199,You have two choices:  1. Leave  2. Become dinner.
200,Your actions don't appear to be doing much harm to the cyclops, but
200,they do not exactly lower your insurance premiums, either.
201,The cyclops ignores all injuries to his body with a shrug.
202,The cyclops is rather heavy and doesn't take kindly to being grabbed.
203,You cannot tie the cyclops, although he is fit to be tied.
204,Realizing just in time that you'd be stabbed in the back if you
204,tried to take the chalice, you return to the fray.
205,Congratulations!  Unlike the other vandals, who merely stole the
205,artist's masterpieces, you have destroyed one.
206,worthless piece of canvas
207,There is a worthless piece of canvas here.
208,With great effort, you open the window far enough to allow passage.
209,The window closes (more easily than it opened).
210,The bolt won't turn with your best effort.
211,The sluice gates open, and water pours through the dam.
212,The sluice gates close, and water starts to collect behind the dam.
213,You can't do that!
214,The grating is locked.
215,The grating opens to reveal trees above you.
216,The grating opens.
217,The grating is unlocked.
218,The door reluctantly opens to reveal a rickety staircase descending
218,into darkness.
219,The door swings shut and closes.
220,The door is locked from above.
221,The door cannot be opened.
222,You cannot burn this door.
223,The door is invulnerable.
224,You cannot damage this door.
225,The door is still under warranty.
226,The machine comes to life (figuratively) with a dazzling display
226,of colored lights and bizarre noises.  After a few moments, the
226,excitement fades.
227,The machine doesn't seem to want to do anything.
228,A force keeps you from taking the bodies.
229,The voice of the guardian of the dungeon booms out from the darkness,
229,"Your disrespect has cost you your life!" and places your head on a pole.
230,The lights within the room shut off.
231,The lights within the room come on.
232,Click.
233,There is a rumbling sound and a stream of water appears to burst
233,from the east wall of the room (apparently, a leak has occurred
233,in a pipe).
234,The blue button appears to be jammed.
235,The boat must be on the ground to be inflated.
236,The boat inflates and appears seaworthy.
237,You don't have enough lung power to inflate it.
238,This boat will not inflate since some cretin put a hole in it.
239,Well done.  The boat is repaired.
240,There is a hissing sound and the boat deflates.
241,The boat deflates.
242,You can't deflate the boat while you're in it.
243,The boat must be on the ground to be deflated.
244,Very good.
245,The rainbow seems to have become somewhat run of the mill.
246,Suddenly, the rainbow appears to become solid and, I venture,
246,walkable (I think the giveaway was the stairs and bannister).
247,The structural integrity of the rainbow seems to have declined
247,precipitously, leaving you about 450 feet in the air, supported
247,by water vapor.
248,The ballon is fastened to the hook.
249,The balloon is not tied to anything.
250,The wire falls off the hook.
251,The box is imbedded in the wall.
252,What do you expect, BOOM?
253,The box has no door!
254,The box is rusted and will not open.
255,The box is not open, chomper!
256,The wire starts to burn.
257,"Thank you very much," he says.  "I don't believe I've seen a
257,# as beautiful.  Follow me."  A door appears on the west end
257,of the ledge.  Through the door, you can see a narrow chimney
257,sloping downward.  The gnome moves quickly, and he disappears
257,from sight.
258,"That wasn't quite what I had in mind", he says, crunching
258,the # in his rock hard hands.
259,The gnome appears increasingly nervous.
260,Although the implementers are gone, they foresaw that some cretin
260,would tamper with their remains.  Therefore, they took steps to
260,prevent this.
261,Unfortunately, we've run out of poles.  Therefore, in punishment for
261,your transgression, we shall deprive you of all your valuables, and
261,of your life.
262,Congratulations!  You've managed to break all the bottles.  Fortunately
262,for your feet, they were made of magic glass and disppear immediately.
263,As you reach for the sphere, an iron cage falls from the ceiling
263,to entrap you.  To make matters worse, poisonous gas starts coming
263,into the room.
264,As the robot reaches for sphere, an iron cage falls from the
264,ceiling.  The robot attempts to fend it off but is trapped below it.
264,Alas, the robot short circuits in his vain attempt to escape and
264,crushes the sphere beneath him as he falls to the floor.
265,There is a giant spark, and you are fried to a crisp.
266,Nothing seems to happen.
267,The whirring increases in intensity slightly.
268,The whirring decreases in intensity slightly.
269,A dull thump is heard in the distance.
270,The flask breaks into pieces.
271,Here noxious vapors prevent your entry.
272,Just before you pass out, you notice that the vapors from the
272,flask's contents are fatal.
273,Suddenly, the room appears to have become very large.
274,The only writing visible is a capital E.  The rest is too small to
274,be clearly visible.
275,You can't see through that!
276,The letters appear larger but are still too small to read.
277,The icing, now visible, says "EXPLODE".
278,The icing, now visible, says "EVAPORATE".
279,The icing, now visible, says "ENLARGE".
280,The pool of water evaporates, revealing a tin of rare spices.
281,The door to the room seems to be blocked by sticky orange rubble
281,from an explosion.  Probably some careless adventurer was playing
281,with blasting cakes.
282,You have been blasted to smithereens (whatever they are).
283,The room around you seems to be getting smaller.
284,The room seems to have become too small to hold you.  It seems
284,that the walls are not as compressable as your body, which is
284,more or less demolished.
285,The robot is injured (being of shoddy construction) and falls to the
285,floor in a pile of garbage, which disintegrates before your eyes.
286,How romantic!
287,If you must... Poof, you're dead!
288,The grue is a sinister, lurking presence in the dark places of the
288,earth.  His favorite diet is adventurers, but its insatiable
288,appetite is tempered by its fear of light.  No grue has ever been
288,seen by the light of day, and few have survived its fearsome jaws
288,to tell the tale.
289,There is no grue here, but I'm sure there is at least one lurking in
289,the darkness nearby.  I wouldn't let my light go out if I were you!
290,The bucket rises and comes to a stop.
291,The bucket descends and comes to a stop.
292,You notice that the # has burned out, and that
292,the cloth bag is starting to deflate.
293,I hope you have more light than from a #.
294,I didn't realize that adventurers are stupid enough to light a
294,# in a room which reeks of coal gas.  Fortunately,
294,there is still justice in the world.
295,Oh, dear.  It appears that the smell coming from this room was coal
295,gas.  I would have thought twice about carrying a # in here.
296,There is now a puddle in the middle of the #.
297,The water leaks out of the # and evaporates immediately.
298,You won't melt it with a #.
299,The bolt can't be turned with your #.
300,It seems that a # won't do.
301,With a #?
302,The robot gladly takes the # and nods his headlike
302,appendage in thanks.
303,A #?  Surely you jest.
304,He who puts his hand to the plow and looks back is not fit for the
304,kingdom of winners.  In any case, 'BACK' doesn't work.
305,You'll have to speak up if you expect me to hear you.
306,I don't know how to do that.  I win in all cases.
307,At your service!
308,The FROBOZZ Company, Ltd., created, owns, and operates this dungeon.
309,Well, FOO, BAR, and BLETCH to you too!
310,It could very well be too late.
311,The dungeon is ALWAYS open (always room for one more).
312,Naturally!
313,AAAARRRRRRGGGGGGGGHHHHHHHHHH!
314,Very good.  Now you can go to the second grade.
315,Have you tried hopping around the dungeon, too?
316,Are you enjoying yourself?
317,Wheeeeee!
318,Do you expect me to applaud?
319,Such language in a high-class establishment like this!
320,You ought to be ashamed of yourself.
321,It's not so bad.  You could have been killed already.
322,Tough shit, asshole.
323,Oh, dear.  Such language from a supposedly winning adventurer!
324,That word is henceforth replaced with DUNGEON.
325,I think you are taking this thing for granite.
326,Brief descriptions.
327,Maximum verbosity.
328,No long descriptions.
329,You can see:  A #.
330,Swimming is not allowed in this dungeon.
331,I don't really see how.
332,I think that swimming is best performed in water.
333,Perhaps it is your head that is swimming.
334,Wasn't he an Indian?
335,I didn't think you would really try to go over the falls in a
335,barrel.  It seems that some 450 feet below, you were met by a number
335,of unfriendly rocks and boulders, causing your immediate demise.
336,Wasn't he a sailor?
337,The cyclops, hearing the name of his deadly nemesis, flees the room
337,by knocking down the wall on the north size of the room.
338,There is a clap of thunder and the east door opens.
339,Well what?
340,If you pray enough, your prayers may be answered.
341,Nothing happens.
342,I don't really know how to do that.
343,Do you wish to leave the game?
344,Underneath the pile of leaves is a grating.
345,Underneath the rug is a closed trap door.
346,Hello.
347,Good day.
348,Nice weather we've been having lately.
349,Goodbye.
350,Here, nothing happens.
351,Nothing happens here.
352,I think that phrase is getting a bit worn out.
353,You seem to be repeating yourself.
354,The # bows his head to you in greeting.
355,I think that only schizophrenics say hello to a #.
356,It is impossible to read in the dark.
357,How does one look through a #?
358,How can I read a #?
359,How, exactly, do I ring that?
360,Ding, dong.
361,I'm not sure that a # can be melted.
362,If you wish, but I can't understand why.
363,Dental hygiene is highly recommended, but I'm not sure what
363,you want to brush them with.
364,A nice idea, but with a #?
365,Well, you seem to have been brushing your teeth with some sort of
365,glue.  As a result, your mouth gets glued together with your nose,
365,and you die of respiratory failure.
366,Unfortunately, the troll can't hear you.
367,Inflating it further would probably burst it.
368,How can you inflate that?
369,Come on, now!
370,The # isn't sleeping.
371,This has no effect.
372,does not seem to do anything useful
373,is not notably useful
374,isn't very interesting
375,doesn't appear worthwhile
376,has no effect
377,doesn't do anything
378,Kicking a # #.
379,Waving a # #.
380,Playing in this way with a # #.
381,Fiddling with a # #.
382,Pushing the # #.
383,I don't think so.
384,This cannot be tied, so it cannot be untied!
385,How can you tie that to anything?
386,You can't tie the # to that.
387,You could certainly never tie the # with that!
388,The # struggles and you cannot tie him up.
389,Why would you tie up a #?
390,You can't turn that.
391,You certainly can't turn it with a #.
392,Digging with the # is slow and tedious.
393,Digging with a # is silly.
394,I don't think that anybody is home.
395,Why knock on a #?
396,It sounds like there is something inside the #.
397,All of the objects in the # spill out.
398,I can't get to that to move it.
399,You can't move the #.
400,You can't turn that on.
401,It is already on.
402,You can't turn that off.
403,It is already off.
404,The # is now on.
405,The # is now off.
406,It is now pitch black.
407,You must tell me how to do that to a #.
408,The # cannot be opened.
409,Opened.
410,Opening the # reveals:
411,The # cannot be closed.
412,It is already open.
413,It is already closed.
414,Closed.
415,There is a # here.
416,You are carrying a #.
417,It is in the #, which is in the room.
418,It is in the #, which you are carrying.
419,Time passes...
420,The # must be on the ground to be boarded.
421,I suppose you have a theory on boarding a #.
422,You are already in the #, cretin!
423,You are now in the #.
424,You aren't in that!
425,You realize, just in time, that disembarking here would probably
425,be fatal.
426,You are on your own feet again.
427,You can't go there without a vehicle.
428,You can't go there in a #.
429,I see nothing special about the #.
430,It is pitch dark.  You are likely to be eaten by a grue.
431,You are in the #.
432,The # has died.
433,The troll, disarmed, cowers in terror, pleading for his life in
433,the guttural tounge of the trolls.
434,The troll, now worried about this encounter, recovers his
434,bloody axe.
435,An unconscious troll is sprawled on the floor.  All passages out
435,of the room are open.
436,A nasty-looking troll, brandishing a bloody axe, blocks all passages
436,out of the room.
437,The troll stirs, quickly resuming a fighting stance.
438,The troll spits in your face, saying "Better luck next time".
439,The troll laughs at your puny gesture.
440,The troll, who is remarkably coordinated, catches the #
441,The troll, who is not overly proud, graciously accepts the gift
442,and not having the most discriminating tastes, gleefully eats it.
443,and being for the moment sated, throws it back.  Fortunately, the
443,troll has poor control, and the knife falls on the floor.  He does
443,not look pleased.
444,Sadly, # can't be put in a #.
445,You can't take the #.
446,Aren't you forgetting something?
447,That would be a good trick.
448,The # is too big to jump over.
449,You should have looked before you leaped.
450,I'm afraid that leap was a bit much for your weak frame.
451,In the movies, your life would be passing in front of your eyes.
452,Geronimo...
453,I don't think that the # would agree with you.
454,I think you should get that first.
455,Thank you very much.  It really hit the spot.
456,How can I drink that?
457,I'd like to, but I can't get to that.
458,Thank you very much.  I was rather thirsty, probably from all
458,this talking.
459,The # catches fire.
460,Unfortunately, you were holding it at the time.
461,You don't have that.
462,The # catches fire and is consumed.
463,I don't think you can burn a #.
464,It doesn't seem to work.
465,Can you unlock a grating with a #?
466,Munging a # #.
467,Trying to kill a # #.
468,Trying to attack a # #.
469,There is nothing here to attack.
470,I've known strange people, but attacking a #?
471,with your bare hands is suicidal
472,with that is very self-destructive
473,You are in perfect health.
474,You have a light wound.
475,You have a serious wound.
476,You have several wounds.
477,You have serious wounds.
478,You are at death's door.
479,You can be killed by one more light wound.
480,You can be killed by a serious wound.
481,You can survive one serious wound.
482,You are strong enough to take several wounds.
483,You have been killed once.
484,You have been killed twice.
485,This gives you the rank of cheater.
486,This gives you the rank of wizard.
487,This gives you the rank of master.
488,This gives you the rank of winner.
489,This gives you the rank of hacker.
490,This gives you the rank of adventurer.
491,This gives you the rank of junior adventurer.
492,This gives you the rank of novice adventurer.
493,This gives you the rank of amateur adventurer.
494,This gives you the rank of beginner.
495,Your sword is no longer glowing.
496,Your sword is glowing with a faint blue glow.
497,You sword has begun to glow very brightly.
498,Annoyed to be left unarmed in such an obviously dangerous
498,neighborhood, the thief slips off into the shadows.
499,The robber, somewhat surprised by this turn of events, nimbly
499,recovers his stilletto.
500,His booty remains.
501,As the thief dies, the power of his magic decreases, and his
501,treasures reappear:  A #.
502,  A #.
503,There is a suspicious-looking individual, holding a bag, leaning
503,against one wall.  He is armed with a vicious-looking stilletto.
504,There is a suspicious-looking individual lying unconscious on the
504,ground.  His bag and stilletto seem to have vanished.
505,The robber revives, briefly feigning continued unconsciousness, and
505,when he sees his moment, scrambles away from you.
506,Once you got him, what would you do with him?
507,You missed.  The thief makes no attempt to take the knife, although
507,it would be a fine addition to the collection in his bag.  He does
507,seem angered by your attempt.
508,You evidently frightened the robber, although you missed him.  He flees.
509,You evidently frightened the robber, although you missed him.  He flees,
509,but the contents of his bag fall on the floor.
510,Your proposed victim suddenly recovers consciousness.
511,The thief seems rather offended by your offer.  Do you think he's as
511,stupid as you are?
512,The thief places the # in his bag and thanks you politely.
513,The candles are not lit.
514,The flame is extinguished.
515,Alas, there's not much left of the candles.  Certainly not enough to
515,burn.
516,With what?
517,The candles are lit.
518,The candles are already lit.
519,You have to light them with something that's burning, you know.
520,You realize just in time that the candles are already lit.
521,The heat from the torch is so intense that the candles are vaporized.
522,Oh, no!  You walked into the slavering fangs of a lurking grue.
523,Oh, no!  A fearsome grue slithered into the room and devoured you.
524,You can't go that way.
525,The # is closed.
526,I can't reach that.
527,You aren't carrying that.
528,Dropped.
529,Thrown.
530,You watch as the balloon slowly lands.
531,The balloon has landed.
532,You have landed, but the balloon did not survive.
533,You watch as the balloon slowly descends.
534,The balloon descends.
535,You hear a boom and notice that the balloon is falling to the ground.
536,Your balloon has hit the rim of the volcano, ripping the cloth and
536,causing you to drop 500 feet.  Did you get your flight insurance?
537,You watch as the balloon slowly ascends.
538,The balloon ascends.
539,You watch as the balloon slowly floats away.  It seems to be ascending,
539,due to its light load.
540,The balloon leaves the ledge.
541,You watch as the balloon slowly lifts off.
542,The balloon slowly rises from the ground.
543,The cloth bag is draped over the side.
544,The balloon is inflated, and there is a # burning
544,in the receptacle.
545,The balloon is tied to the hook.
546,I'm afraid you can't control the balloon in that way.
547,You are tied to the ledge.
548,You don't really want to hold a burning #.
549,The receptacle is already occupied.
550,The # burns inside the receptacle.
551,The balloon inflates as it fills with hot air.
552,Not likely.
553,An interesting idea, but...
554,A valiant attempt.
555,You can't be serious.
556,Not a prayer.
557,You already have it.
558,Your load is too heavy.  You will have to leave something behind.
559,Taken.
560,Nice try.
561,I can't do that.
562,I can't reach inside.
563,How can you do that?
564,The # is already in the #.
565,It won't fit.
566,I can't reach the #.
567,The cage shakes and is hurled across the room.
568,"I am sorry but that action is difficult in the absense of a mouth."
569,"My vision is not that good without eyes."
570,"I am only a stupid robot and cannot perform that command."
571,ECHO
571,The acoustics of the room change subtly.
572,Almost as soon as the # breathes his last, a cloud of
572,sinister black smoke envelops him, and when the fog lifts, the
572,carcass has disappeared.
573,The # contains:
574,Your collection of treasures consists of:
575,You are carrying:
576,The # is carrying:
577,By some miracle of elven technology, you have managed to
577,stop the leak in the dam.
578,You are empty handed.
579,It is too dark in here to see.
580,#:
581,I could't find anything.
582,I couldn't find any valuables.
583,Someone carrying a large bag is casually leaning against one of the
583,walls here.  He does not speak, but it is clear from his aspect that
583,the bag will be taken only over his dead body.
584,Your opponent, determining discretion to be the better part of
584,valor, decides to terminate this little contretemps.  With a rueful
584,nod of his head, he steps backward into the gloom and disappears.
585,The holder of the large bag just left, looking disgusted.
585,Fortunately, he took nothing.
586,A 'lean and hungry' gentleman just wandered through.  Finding
586,nothing of value, he left disgruntled.
587,A seedy-looking individual with a large bag just wandered through
587,the room.  On the way, he quietly abstracted all valuables from the
587,room and from your possession, mumbling something about, "Do unto
587,others before...".
588,The other occupant (he of the large bag), finding nothing of value,
588,left disgusted.
589,The other occupant just left carrying his large bag.  You may not
589,have noticed that he robbed you blind first.
590,Off in the distance you hear someone saying, "My, I wonder what this
590,fine # is doing here?"
591,You are still recovering from the last blow, so your attack is
591,ineffective.
592,Attacking a dead # is pointless.
593,Well, you really did it that time.  Is suicide painless?
594,The # slowly regains his feet.
595,The unconscious # cannot defend himself:  he dies.
596,It appears that the last blow was too much for you.  I'm afraid
596,that you are dead.
597,Saved.
598,I can't access the save file.
599,Restored.
600,Your save file is obsolete and cannot be restored.
601,I don't understand that.
602,You cannot talk to that!
603,You cannot talk through another person.
604,Please input the entire command again.
605,Fortunately, you still have a #.
606,You are in a room with an exit on the west side, and a staircase
606,leading up.
607,A cyclops, who looks prepared to eat horses (much less mere
607,adventurers), blocks the staircase.  From his state of health
607,and the bloodstains on the wall, you gather that he is not very
607,friendly, though he likes people.
608,The cyclops is standing in the corner, eyeing you closely.  I don't
608,think he likes you very much.  He looks extremely hungry, even for
608,a cyclops.
609,The cyclops, having eaten the hot peppers, appears to be gasping.
609,His enflamed tongue protrudes from his man-sized mouth.
610,The cyclops, perhaps affected by a drug in your drink, is sleeping
610,blissfully at the foot of the stairs.
611,On the north of the room is a wall which used to be solid, but which
611,now has a cyclops-shaped hole in it.
612,The bottle is closed.
613,The bottle is already full.
614,The bottle is now full of water.
615,The water slips through your fingers.
616,Too many prepositions.
617,Too many objects.
618,I can't see one here.
619,Which one do you mean?
620,I can't reach that from inside the #.
621,What should I do with the #?
622,Huh?
623,You must supply a direct object.
624,You must supply an indirect object.
625,Normally, I would offer to patch you up, but I'm ashamed to say my
625,abilities are not equal to dealing with your present condition.
625,Please let me express my profoundest regrets.
626,The thief, being temporarily incapacitated, is unable to acknowledge
626,your greeting with his usual graciousness.
627,The thief is taken aback by your unexpected generosity but accepts
627,the # and stops to admire its beauty.
628,The # is open, but I can't tell what's beyond it.
629,The # is empty.
630,I don't know how to look inside a #.
631,There is nothing interesting there.
632,I don't really see how.
633,The implementers are dead;  therefore, they do not respond.
634,You can't wind a #.
635,You hear in the distance the chirping of a song bird.
636,A metallic voice says, "Hello, Intruder!  Your unauthorized presence
636,in the vault area of the Bank of Zork has set off all sorts of nasty
636,suprises, several of which seem to have been fatal.  This message
636,brought to you by the Frobozz Magic Alarm Company."
637,An epicece Gnome of Zurich, wearing a three-piece suit and carrying a
637,safety deposit box materializes in the room.  "You seem to have
637,forgotten to deposit your valuables," he says, tapping the lid of the
637,box impatiently.  "We don't usually allow customers to use the boxes
637,here, but we can make this ONE exception, I suppose..."  He looks
637,askance at you over his wire-rimmed bifocals.
638,The gnome looks impatient:  "I may have another customer waiting;
638,you'll just have to fend for yourself, I'm afraid."  He disappears,
638,leaving you alone in the bare room.
639,Talk about eating rich foods!
640,Nothing like having money to burn!
641,"I wouldn't put THAT in a safety deposit box," remarks the gnome with
641,disdain, tossing it over his shoulder, where it disappears with an
641,understated "pop".
642,The gnome carefully places the # in the
642,deposit box.  "Let me show you the way out," he says, making it clear
642,that he will be pleased to see the last of you.  Then, you are momentarily
642,disoriented, and when you recover, you are back at the Bank Entrance.
643,The gnome says, "Well, I never!" and disappears with a snap of his
643,fingers, leaving you alone.
644,The gnome appears increasingly impatient.
645,There is an unpleasant grinding noise from inside the canary.
646,The canary chirps blithely, if somewhat tinnily, for a short time.
647,The canary chirps, slightly off key, an aria from a forgotten opera.
647,From out of the greenery flies a lovely song bird.  It perches on a
647,limb just over your head and opens its beak to sing.  As it does so,
647,a beautiful brass bauble drops from its mouth, bounces off the top
647,of your head, and lands glimmering in the grass.  As the canary winds
647,down, the song bird flies away.
648,The cliff is too steep for climbing.
649,The egg is already open.
650,There is no obvious way to open the egg.
651,I doubt you could do that without damaging it.
652,The egg is now open, but the clumsiness of your attempt has
652,seriously diminished its esthetic appeal.
653,The concept of using a # is certainly original.
654,Not to say that using a # isn't original either...
655,You rather indelicate handling of the egg has caused it some damage.
655,The egg is now open.
656,Climbing the walls is of no avail.
657,Bizarre!
658,The egg falls to the ground and is seriously damaged.
659,The # falls to the ground.
660,You are about ten feet above the ground nestled among some large
660,branches.  The nearest branch above you is beyond your reach.
661,On the ground below you can see:
662,I can't see any wall here.
663,That cannot be turned.
664,You would be lost without me.
665,You don't have the #.
666,The song bird is not here, but it is probably nearby.
667,I can't see any song bird here.
668,You feel somewhat disoriented as you pass through...
669,You hit your head against the # as you attempt this feat.
670,You can't go more than part way through the curtain.
671,That would involve quite a contortion!
672,You are in it, turkey!
673,As you try, your hand seems to go through it.
674,The # goes through it.
675,The # passes through the wall and vanishes.
676,The curtain dims slightly as the # passes through.
677,I can't do that with everything at once.
678,There is a wall there.
679,There is no way up.
680,There is no way down.
681,You are in part of the long hallway.  The east and west walls are
681,dressed stone.  In the center of the hall is a shallow stone channel.
681,In the center of the room the channel widens into a large hole around
681,which is engraved a compass rose.
682,Somewhat to the south, identical stone statues face each other from
682,pedestals on opposite sides of the corridor.  The statues represent
682,Guardians of Zork, a military order of ancient lineage.  They are
682,portrayed as heavily armored warriors standing at ease, hands clasped
682,around formidable bludgeons.
683,Somewhat to the north, identical stone statues face each other from
683,pedestals on opposite sides of the corridor.  The statues represent
683,Guardians of Zork, a military order of ancient lineage.  They are
683,portrayed as heavily armored warriors standing at ease, hands clasped
683,around formidable bludgeons.
684,A passage enters from the south.
685,The Guardians awake and, in perfect unison, destroy you with
685,their stone bludgeons.  Satisfied, they resume their posts.
686,To the north and south are large hallways.
687,To the north is a large hallway.
688,You are inside a rectangular box of wood whose structure is rather
688,complicated.  Four sides and the roof are filled in, and the floor
688,is open.
688,   As you face the side opposite the entrance, two short sides of
688,carved and polished wood are to your left and right.  The left panel
688,is mahogany, the right pine.  The wall you face is red on its left
688,half and black on its right.  On the entrance side, the wall is white
688,opposite the red part of the wall it faces, and yellow opposite the
688,black section.  The painted walls are at least twice the length of
688,the unpainted ones.  The ceiling is painted blue.
688,   In the floor is a stone channel about six inches wide and a foot
688,deep.  The channel is oriented in a north-south direction.  In the
688,exact center of the room the channel widens into a circular
688,depression perhaps two feet wide.  Incised in the stone around this
688,area is a compass rose.
688,   Running from one short wall to the other at about waist height
688,is a wooden bar, carefully carved and drilled.  This bar is pierced
688,in two places.  The first hole is in the center of the bar (and thus
688,in the center of the room).  The second is at the left end of the room
688,(as you face opposite the entrance).  Through each hole runs a wooden
688,pole.
688,   The pole at the left end of the bar extends only about a foot
689,above the bar and ends in a hand grip.  The pole is resting on the
689,stone floor.
690,above the bar and ends in a hand grip.  The pole has been dropped
690,into a hole carved in the stone floor.
691,above the bar and ends in a hand grip.  The pole has been lifted out
691,of a hole carved in the stone floor.  There is evidently enough
691,friction to keep the pole from dropping back down.
692,above the bar and ends in a hand grip.  The pole has been dropped
692,into the stone channel incised in the floor.
693,above the bar and ends in a hand grip.  The pole is positioned above
693,the stone channel in the floor.
694,   The pole at the center of the bar extends from the ceiling
694,through the bar to the circular area in the stone channel.  The
694,bottom end of this pole has a T-bar a bit less than two feet long
694,attached to it.  On the T-bar is carved an arrow.  The arrow and
694,T-bar are pointing #.

703,You are in a small room, with narrow passages exiting to the north
703,and south.  A narrow red beam of light crosses the room at the north
703,end, inches above the floor.
704,You are in a small room, with narrow passages exiting to the north
704,and south.  A narrow red beam of light crosses the room at the north
704,end, inches above the floor.  The beam is stopped halfway across the
704,room by a # lying on the floor.
705,Though large and esthetically pleasing, the crypt is empty;  the
705,sarcophagi, bodies, and rich treasures to be expected in a tomb of
705,this magnificence are missing.  Inscribed on the wall is the motto of
705,the implementers, "Feel Free".  There is a door leading out of the
705,crypt to the south.  The door is #.
706,You are in an east-west corridor which turns north at its eastern
706,and western ends.  The walls of the corridor are marble.  An
706,additional passage leads south at the center of the corridor.
707,In the center of the north wall of the passage is a bronze door
707,which is #.
708,You are in a narrow north-south corridor.  At the south end is a door
708,and at the north end is an east-west corridor.  The door is #.
709,You are in a north-south hallway which ends in a large wooden door.
710,The wooden door has a barred panel in it at about head height.  The
710,panel is #, and the door is #.
711,You are in a large east-west corridor which opens out to a northern
711,parapet at its center.  You can see flames and smoke as you peer
711,towards the parapet.  The corridor turns south at its east and west
711,ends, and due south is a massive wooden door.  In the door is a small
711,window barred with iron.  The door is #.
712,You are standing behind a stone retaining wall which rims a large
712,parapet overlooking a fiery pit.  It is difficult to see through the
712,smoke and flame which fills the pit, but it seems to be more or less
712,bottomless.  It also extends upwards out of sight.  The pit itself
712,is of roughly dressed stone and is circular in shape.  It is about
712,two hundred feet in diameter.  The flames generate considerable heat,
712,so it is rather uncomfortable standing here.
712,   There is an object here which looks like a sundial.  On it are
712,an indicator arrow and (in the center) a large button.  On the face
712,of the dial are numbers "one" through "eight".  The indicator points
712,to the number "#".
713,one
714,two
715,three
716,four

718,six

721,You are in a featureless prison cell.  You can see only the flames
721,and smoke from the pit out of the small window in the closed door
721,in front of you.
722,You are in a featureless prison cell.  You can see the east-west
722,corridor outside the open wooden door in front of you.
723,Behind you is a bronze door which seems to be #.
724,You are in a featureless prison cell.  Its wooden door is securely
724,fastened, and you can see only the flames and smoke of the pit out
724,its small window.
725,You are in a featureless prison cell.  Its wooden door is securely
725,fastened, and you can see only the flames and smoke of the pit out
725,its small window.  On the other side of the cell is a bronze door
725,which seems to be #.
726,   As you gleefully examine your new-found riches, the Dungeon
726,Master himself materializes beside you and says, "Now that you have
726,solved all the mysteries of the Dungeon, it is time for you to assume
726,your rightfully-earned place in the scheme of things.  Long have I
726,waited for one capable of releasing me from my burden!"  He taps you
726,lightly on the head with his staff and mumbles a few well-chosen spells.
726,You feel yourself changing, growing older and more stooped.  For a
726,moment there are two identical mages staring at each other among the
726,treasures, then you watch as your counterpart dissolves into a mist
726,and disappears, a sardonic grin on his face.
727,Suddenly, as you wait in the dark, you begin to feel somewhat
727,disoriented.  The feeling passes, but something seems different.
727,As you regain your composure, the cloaked figure appears before you
727,and says, "You are now ready to face the ultimate challenge of
727,Zork.  Should you wish to do this somewhat more quickly in the
727,future, you will be given a magic phrase which will at any time
727,transport you by magic to this point.  To select the phrase, say
727,	INCANT, <word>
727,and you will be told your own magic phrase to use by saying
727,	INCANT, <phrase>
727,Good luck, and choose wisely!"
728,The button pops back to its original position.
729,The mirror quietly swings shut.
730,The pine wall closes quietly.
731,The structure shakes slightly but doesn't move.
732,The short pole prevents the structure from rotating.
733,The movement of the structure alerts the Guardians.
734,The arrow on the compass rose now indicates #.
735,The structure rocks back and forth slightly but doesn't move.
736,The pine wall swings open.
737,The pine door opens into the field of view of the Guardians.
738,The structure has reached the end of the stone channel and won't
738,budge.
739,The structure slides # and stops over another compass rose.
740,The structure wobbles # and stops over another compass rose.
741,The structure wobbles as it moves, alerting the Guardians.
742,The Guardian notices a wooden structure creeping by, and his
742,suspicions are aroused.
743,Suddenly, the Guardians realize that someone is trying to sneak by
743,them in the structure.  They awake and, in perfect unison, hammer
743,the box and its contents (including you) to a pulp.  Satisfied, they
743,resume their posts.
744,A Guardian notices the open side of the structure, and his suspicions
744,are aroused.
745,Attacking the Guardians is about as futile as attacking a stone wall.
745,Unfortunately for you, your futile blow attracts their attention, and
745,they manage to dispatch you effortlessly.
746,The statues are impassive.
747,The dungeon master is taken momentarily by surprise.  He dodges your
747,blow and then, with a disappointed expression on his face, he raises
747,his staff and traces a complicated pattern in the air.  As it
747,completes you crumble into dust.
748,"I'm willing to accompany you, but not to ride in your pocket!"
749,The pole is now slightly above the floor.
750,The pole cannot be raised further.
751,The pole cannot be lowered further.
752,The pole is lowered into the channel.
753,The pole is lowered into the stone hole.
754,The pole is already resting on the floor.
755,The pole now rests on the stone floor.
756,The button becomes depressed.
757,The button pops back out.
758,The button is already depressed.
759,No doubt you have a bottle of moonbeams as well.
760,The beam is now interrupted by a # lying on the floor.
761,You can't break the beam with a #.
762,The # already breaks the beam.
763,I see no bronze door here.
764,The bronze door opens.
765,The bronze door closes.
766,On the other size of the door is a narrow passage which opens out
766,into a larger area.
767,The door won't budge.
768,The knock reverberates along the hall.  For a time it seems there
768,will be no answer.  Then you hear someone unlatching the small wooden
768,panel.  Through the bars of the great door, the wrinkled face of an
768,old man appears.  He gazes down at you and intones as follows:
768,   "I am the Master of the Dungeon, whose task it is to insure
768,that none but the most scholarly and masterful adventurers are
768,admitted into the secret realms of the Dungeon.  To ascertain whether
768,you meet the stringent requirements laid down by the Great
768,Implementers, I will ask three questions which should be easy for
768,one of your reputed excellence to answer.  You have undoubtedly
768,discovered the answers during your travels through the Dungeon.
768,Should you answer each of these questions correctly within five
768,attempts, then I am obliged to acknowledge your skill and daring and
768,admit you to these regions.
768,   "All answers should be in the form 'ANSWER, <answer>'."
769,The booming voice asks:
770,"From which room can one enter the robber's hideaway without passing
770,through the cyclops room?"
771,"Beside the Temple, to which room is it possible to go from the Altar?"
772,"What is the absolute minimum specified value of the Zorkmid
772,treasures, in Zorkmids?"
773,"What object is of use in determining the function of the iced cakes?"
774,"What can be done to the Mirror that is useful?"
775,"The taking of which object offends the ghosts?"
776,"What object in the Dungeon is haunted?"
777,"In which room is the phrase 'Hello sailor' useful?"
778,The door is securely fastened.
779,The wooden door opens.
780,The wooden door closes.
781,The dungeon master says, "I will stay."
782,The dungeon master says, "I will follow."
783,There is no reply.
784,"I prefer to stay where I am, thank you."
785,"I am not permitted to enter the prison cell."
786,"I cannot perform that action for you."
787,This gives you the rank of Dungeon Master.
788,This gives you the rank of Super Cheater.
789,This gives you the rank of Master Cheater.
790,This gives you the rank of Advanced Cheater.
791,This gives you the rank of Cheater.
792,You are in the Tomb of the Unknown Implementer.  A hollow voice
792,says, "That's not a bug, it's a feature!"
792,In the north wall of the room is the Crypt of the Implementers.  It
792,is made of the finest marble and is apparently large enough for four
792,headless corpses.  The crypt is #.  Above the entrance is the
792,cryptic inscription:
792,
792,		"Feel Free".
793,The door of the crypt is extremely heavy, but it opens easily.
794,The crypt is already open.
795,The crypt is already closed.
796,The crypt is closed.
797,The dial spins and comes to a stop pointing at "#".
798,There is no answer.
799,No one seems to be listening.
800,The dungeon master says, "Excellent."
801,The dungeon master says, "You are wrong.  You have four more chances."
802,The dungeon master says, "You are wrong.  You have three more chances."
803,The dungeon master says, "You are wrong.  You have two more chances."
804,The dungeon master says, "You are wrong.  You have one more chance."
805,The mirror is closed.
806,You must specify what to set the dial to.
807,The dial face contains only numbers.
808,The dial now points to "#".
809,The button depresses with a slight click and pops back.
810,The cell door is now closed.
811,You notice that the dungeon master does not follow.
812,The dungeon master catches up with you.
813,The dungeon master follows you.
814,There is a wooden wall blocking your way.
815,There is a large mirror blocking your way.
816,There is a large broken mirror blocking your way.
817,The structure blocks your way.
818,As you leave, the door swings shut.
819,You are in a narrow room whose west wall is a large mirror.
820,You are in a narrow room whose east wall is a large mirror.
821,You are in a narrow room whose west wall is a large wooden panel
821,which once contained a mirror.
822,You are in a narrow room whose east wall is a large wooden panel
822,which once contained a mirror.
823,The mirror is mounted on a panel which has been opened outward.
824,The panel has been opened outward.
825,The opposite wall is solid rock.
826,The dungeon master says, "You are wrong."  The dungeon master,
826,obviously disappointed in your lack of knowledge, shakes his head
826,and mumbles, "I guess they'll let anyone in the Dungeon these days."
826,With that, he departs.
827,The dungeon master, obviously pleased, says, "You are indeed a
827,master of lore.  I am proud to be at your service."  The massive
827,wooden door swings open, and the master motions for you to enter.
828,Saves are not permitted during the endgame.
829,Restores are not permitted during the endgame.
830,The structure rotates clockwise.
831,The structure rotates counterclockwise.
832,I can't see a mirror here.
833,I don't see any way to open the mirror here.
834,The mirror breaks, revealing a panel behind it.
835,The mirror has already been broken.
836,The mirror is mounted on a wooden panel which moves slightly inward
836,as you push and back out as you let go.  The mirror feels rather
836,fragile.
837,The mirror is unyielding but seems rather fragile.
838,I can't see a panel here.
839,I don't see any way to open the panel here.
840,To break the panel you would have to break the mirror first.
841,The panel is not that easily destroyed.
842,The wooden panel moves slightly inward as you push and back out
842,when you let go.
843,The panel is unyielding.
844,A disheveled adventurer stares back at you.
845,The mirror is broken into little pieces.
846,Shards of a broken mirror are dangerous to play with.
847,The # side of the room is divided by a wooden wall into small
848,hallways to the #east and #west.
849,A large mirror fills the # side of the hallway.
850,A large panel fills the # side of the hallway.
851,The shattered pieces of a mirror cover the floor.
852,The corridor continues north.
853,The corridor continues south.
854,The corridor continues north and south.
855,Incantations are useless once you have gotten this far.
856,That incantation seems to have been a failure.
857,Sorry, only one incantation to a customer.
858,That spell has no obvious effect.
859,As the last syllable of your spell fades into silence, darkness
859,envelops you, and the earth shakes.  Then all is quiet.
860,The structure won't budge.

34,to the east, where a small clearing may be seen.
35,You are in a forest, with trees in all directions around you.
37,You are in a deep ravine at a crossing with an east-west crawlway.
37,Some stone steps are at the south of the ravine and a steep staircase
37,descends.
38,You are in a crawlway with a three foot high ceiling.  Your footing
38,is very unsure here due to the assortment of rocks undefoot.  Passages
38,can be seen in the east, west, and northwest corners of the crawlway.
42,You are standing on a path beside a gently flowing stream.  The path
42,travels to the north and the east.
43,You are on the gently flowing stream.  The upstream route is too narrow
43,to navigate, and the downstream route is invisible due to twisting
43,walls.  There is a narrow beach to land on.
44,You are in a room which looks like an Egyptian tomb.  There is an
44,ascending staircase in the room as well as doors east and south.
46,You are in a small chamber behind the remains of the great glacier.
46,To the south and west are small passageways.
47,You are in an ancient room, long buried by the reservoir.  There are
47,exits to the southeast and upward.
48,You are on the south edge of a deep canyon.  Passages lead off
48,to the east, south, and northwest.  You can hear the sound of
48,flowing water below.
49,You are in a large room with a ceiling which cannot be detected from
49,the ground.  There is a narrow passage from east to west and a stone
49,stairway leading upward.  The room is extremely noisy.  In fact, it
49,is difficult to hear yourself think.
52,You are in a small cave with an entrance to the north and a stairway
52,leading down.
53,You are in a tiny cave with entrances west and north, and a dark,
53,forbidding staircase leading down.
54,You are in a steep and narrow crawlway.  There are two exits nearby to
54,the south and southwest.
55,You are in a narrow crawlway.  The crawlway leads from north to south,
55,However, the south passage divides to the south and southwest.
56,You are in a cold and damp corridor where a long east-west passageway
56,intersects with a northward path.
57,You are in a winding passage.  It seems that there is only an exit
57,on the east end, although the whirring from the round room can be
57,heard faintly to the north.
58,You are in a small chamber, which appears to have been part of a
58,coal mine.  On the south wall of the chamber the letters "GRANITE
58,WALL" are etched in the rock.  To the east is a long passage, and
58,there is a steep metal slide twisting downward.  From the appearance
58,of the slide, an attempt to climb up it would be impossible.  To the
58,north is a small opening.
59,You are standing at the entrance of what might have been a coal
59,mine.  To the northeast and the northwest are entrances to the mine,
59,and there is another exit on the south end of the room.
60,You are in a small room.  Strange squeaky sounds may be hear coming
60,from the passage at the west end.  You may also escape to the south.
61,You are in a large room, in the middle of which is a small shaft
61,descending through the floor into darkness below.  To the west and
61,the north are exits from this room.  Constructed over the top of the
61,shaft is a metal framework to which a heavy iron chain is attached.
62,You are in a narrow tunnel with large wooden beams running across
62,the ceiling and around the walls.  A path from the south splits into
62,paths running west and northeast.
63,You are in a small non-descript room.  However, from the direction
63,of a small descending staircase a foul odor can be detected.  To the
63,east is a narrow path.
64,You are in a small room which smells strongly of coal gas.
65,You are in a very small room.  In the corner is a rickety wooden
65,ladder, leading downward.  It might be safe to descend.  There is
65,also a staircase leading upward.
66,You are in a non-descript part of a coal mine.
67,You are in a non-descript part of a coal mine.
68,You are in a non-descript part of a coal mine.

71,You are in a non-descript part of a coal mine.
72,You are in a non-descript part of a coal mine.
73,You are in a rather wide room.  On one side is the bottom of a
73,narrow wooden ladder.  To the northeast and the south are passages
73,leaving the room.
74,Dead end.
75,You are in a long and narrow passage, which is cluttered with broken
75,timbers.  A wide passage comes from the north and turns at the
75,southwest corner of the room into a very narrow passageway.
76,You are in a small square room which is at the bottom of a long
76,shaft.  To the east is a passageway and to the northeast a very narrow
76,passage.  In the shaft can be seen a heavy iron chain.
81,You are in a north-south crawlway;  a passage also goes to the east.
81,There is a hole above, but it provides no opportunities for climbing.
82,You are on the west edge of a chasm, the bottom of which cannot be
82,seen.  The east side is sheer rock, providing no exits.  A narrow
82,passage goes west.  The path you are on continues to the north and south.
84,You are in a high north-south passage, which forks to the northeast.
85,A chasm runs southwest to northeast.  You are on the south edge.  The
85,path exits to the south and to the east.
86,You are in a cave.  Passages exit to the south and to the east, but
86,the cave narrows to a crack to the west.  The earth is particularly
86,damp here.
87,A chasm, evidently produced by an ancient river, runs through the
87,cave here.  Passages lead off in all directions.
88,Dead end.
89,Dead end.
90,You have entered a cave with passages leading north and southeast.
91,This is a room which is bare on all sides.  There is an exit down.
91,To the east is a great door made of stone.  Above the door, the
91,following words are written:  "No man shall enter this room without
91,solving this riddle--
91,	What is tall as a house,
91,	Round as a cup,
91,	And all the king's horses can't draw it up?".
92,This is a former broom closet.  The exits are to the east and west.
95,You are standing in a small circular room with a pedestal.  A set of
95,stairs leads up, and passages leave the the east and west.
96,You are in the west end of a large temple.  On the south wall is an
96,ancient inscription, probably a prayer in a long-forgotten language.
96,The north wall is solid granite.  The entrance at the west end of the
96,room is through huge marble pillars.
97,You are in the east end of a large temple.  In front of you is what
97,appears to be an altar.
99,This room appears to have been the waiting room for groups touring
99,the dam.  There are exits here to the north and east marked
99,"PRIVATE", though the doors are open, and an exit to the south.
100,You are in what appears to have been the maintenance room for flood
100,control dam #3, judging by the assortment of tool chests around the
100,room.  Apparently, this room has been ransacked recently, for most of
100,the valuable equipment is gone.  On the wall in front of you is a
100,panel of buttons, which are labelled in EBCDIC.  However, they are of
100,different colors:  blue, yellow, brown, and red.  The doors to this
100,room are in the west and south ends.
102,You are in a long passage.  To the south is one entrance.  On the
102,east there is an old wooden door with a large hole in it (about
102,cyclops sized).
103,This is a large room, whose north wall is solid granite.  A number
103,of discarded bags, which crumble at your touch, are scattered about
103,on the floor.
104,You are in what appears to have been an artist's studio.  The walls
104,and floors are splattered with paints of 69 different colors.
104,Strangely enough, nothing of value is hanging here.  At the north and
104,northwest of the room are open doors (also covered with paint).  An
104,extremely dark and narrow chimney leads up from a fireplace.  Although
104,you might be able to get up the chimney, it seems unlikely that you
104,could get back down.
105,You are in an art gallery.  Most of the paintings which were here
105,have been stolen by vandals with exceptional taste.  The vandals
105,left through the north, south, or west exits.
106,You are at the base of flood control dam #3, which looms above you
106,and to the north.   The Frigid River is flowing by here.  Across the
106,river are the white cliffs, which seem to form a giant wall stretching
106,from north to south along the east shore of the river as it winds its
106,way downstream.
107,You are on the Frigid River in the vicinity of the dam.  The river
107,flows quietly here.  There is a landing on the west shore.
108,The river turns a corner here making it impossible to see the
108,dam.  The white cliffs loom on the east bank, and large rocks
108,prevent landing on the west.
109,The river descends here into a valley.  There is a narrow beach on
109,the east below the cliffs, and there is some shore on the west which
109,may be suitable.  In the distance a faint rumbling can be heard.
110,You are on a narrow strip of beach which runs along the base of the
110,white cliffs.  The only path here is a narrow one, heading south
110,along the cliffs.
111,You are on a rocky, narrow strip of beach beside the cliffs.  A
111,narrow path leads north along the shore.
112,The river is running faster here, and the sound ahead appears to be
112,that of rushing water.  On the west shore is a sandy beach.  A small
112,area of beach can also be seen below the cliffs.
113,The sound of rushing water is nearly unbearable here.  On the west
113,shore is a large landing area.
115,You are on the shore of the river.  The river here seems somewhat
115,treacherous.  A path travels from north to south here, the south end
115,quickly turning around a sharp corner.
116,You are on a large sandy beach at the shore of the river, which is
116,flowing quickly by.  A path runs beside the river to the south here.
117,You are on the west shore of the river.  An entrance to a cave is
117,to the northwest.  The shore is very rocky here.
118,You are in a small cave whose exits are on the south and northwest.
119,You are in a barrel.  Congratulations.  Etched into the side of the
119,barrel is the word "GERONIMO!".
121,You are on top of a rainbow (I bet you never thought you would walk
121,on a rainbow), with a magnificent view of the falls.  The rainbow
121,travels east-west here.
122,You are on a small beach on the continuation of the Frigid River
122,past the falls.  The beach is narrow due to the presence of the white
122,cliffs.  The river canyon opens here, and sunlight shines in from
122,above.  A rainbow crosses over the falls to the west, and a narrow path
122,continues to the southeast.
123,You are beneath the walls of the river canyon, which may be climbable
123,here.  There is a small stream here, which is the lesser part of the
123,runoff of Aragain Falls.  To the north is a narrow path.
124,You are on a ledge about halfway up the wall of the river canyon.
124,You can see from here that the main flow from Aragain Falls twists
124,along a passage which it is impossible to enter.  Below you is the
124,canyon bottom.  Above you is more cliff, which still appears
124,climbable.
125,You are at the top of the great canyon on its south wall. From here
125,there is a marvelous view of the canyon and parts of the Frigid River
125,upstream.  Across the canyon, the walls of the white cliffs still
125,appear to loom far above.  Following the canyon upstream (north and
125,northwest), Aragain Falls may be seen, complete with rainbow.
125,Fortunately, my vision is better than average, and I can discern the
125,top of flood control dam #3 far to the distant north.  To the
125,west and south can be seen an immense forest, stretching for miles
125,around.  It is possible to climb down into the canyon from here.
126,You are at the bottom of a large dormant volcano.  High above you
126,light may be seen entering from the cone of the volcano.  The only
126,exit here is to the north.
127,You are about one hundred feet above the bottom of the volcano.  The
127,top of the volcano is clearly visible here.
128,You are about two hundred feet above the volcano floor.  Looming
128,above is the rim of the volcano.  There is a small ledge on the
128,west side.
129,You are high above the floor of the volcano.  From here the rim of
129,the volcano looks very narrow, and you are quite near it.  To the
129,east is what appears to be a viewing ledge, too thin to land on.
130,You are near the rim of the volcano, which is only about fifteen feet
130,across.  To the west, there is a place to land with a wide ledge.
131,You are on a narrow ledge overlooking the inside of an old dormant
131,volcano.  This ledge appears to be about in the middle between the
131,floor below and the rim above.  There is an exit here to the south.
132,You are on a ledge in the middle of a large volcano.  Below you
132,the volcano bottom can be seen and above is the rim of the volcano.
132,A couple of ledges can be seen on the other side of the volcano;
132,it appears that this ledge is intermediate in elevation between
132,those on the other side.  The exit from this room is to the east.
134,You are in a room which must have been a large library, probably
134,for the royal family.  All of the shelves appear to have been gnawed
134,to pieces by unfriendly gnomes.  To the north is an exit.
136,You are in a small room, whose walls are formed by an old lava flow.
136,There are exits here to the west and the south.
139,You are in a large room full of assorted heavy machinery.  The room
139,smells of burned resistors.  The room is noisy from the whirring
139,sounds of the machines.  Along one wall of the room are three buttons
139,which are, respectivelly, round, triangular, and square.  Naturally,
139,above the buttons are instructions written in EBCDIC.  A large sign
139,above all the buttons says in English:
139,
139,		    DANGER:  HIGH VOLTAGE
139,
139,There are exits to the west and the south.
140,You are in a dingy closet adjacent to the machine room.  On one wall
140,is a small sticker which reads:
140,
140,		Protected by
140,		  FROBOZZ
140,	     Magic Alarm Company
140,	      (Hello, footpad!).
141,You are trapped inside an steel cage.
142,You are at the top of the well.  Well done.  There are etchings on
142,the side of the well.  There is a small crack across the floor at the
142,entrance to a room on the east, but it can be crossed easily.
143,You are in a damp circular room, whose walls are made of brick and
143,mortar.  The roof of this room is not visible, but there appear to be
143,some etchings on the walls.  There is a passageway to the west.
144,You are in a small square room, in the center of which is a large
144,oblong table, no doubt set for afternoon tea.  It is clear from the
144,objects on the table that the users were indeed mad.  In the eastern
144,corner of this room is a small hole no more than four inches high.
144,There are passageways leading away to the west and the northwest.
145,You are in an enormous room, in the center  of which are four wooden
145,posts delineating a rectangular area, above which is what appears to
145,be a wooden roof.  In fact, all objects in this room appear to be
145,abnormally large.  To the east is a passageway.  There is a large
145,chasm on the west and the northwest.
146,You are in a large room, one half of which is depressed.  There is a
146,large leak in the ceiling through which brown colored goop is
146,falling.  The only exit from this room is to the west.
148,You are in the large entrance hall of the Bank of Zork, the largest
148,banking institution of the Great Underground Empire.  A partial
148,account of its history is in "The Lives of the Twelve Flatheads" with
148,the chapter on J. Pierpont Flathead.  A more detailed history (albeit
148,less objective) may be found in Flathead's outrageous autobiography
148,"I'm Rich and You Aren't - So There!".
148,Most of the furniture has been ravaged by passing scavengers.  All
148,that remains are two signs at the northwest and northeast corners of
148,the room, which say
148,
148,	<-- WEST VIEWING ROOM		EAST VIEWING ROOM -->
149,You are in a small square room, which was used by a bank officer
149,whose job it was to retrieve safety desposit boxes for the customer.
149,On the north side of the room is a sign which reads "Viewing Room".
149,On the west side of the room, above an open door, is a sign reading
149,
149,		    BANK PERSONNEL ONLY
150,You are in a small square room, which was used by a bank officer
150,whose job it was to retrieve safety desposit boxes for the customer.
150,On the north side of the room is a sign which reads "Viewing Room".
150,On the east side of the room, above an open door, is a sign reading
150,
150,		    BANK PERSONNEL ONLY
151,You are in a room used by holders of safety deposit boxes to view
151,their contents.  On the north size of the room is a sign which says
151,
151,   REMAIN HERE WHILE THE BANK OFFICER RETRIEVES YOUR DEPOSIT BOX
151,    WHEN YOU ARE FINISHED, LEAVE THE BOX, AND EXIT TO THE SOUTH
151,     AN ADVANCED PROTECTIVE DEVICE PREVENTS ALL CUSTOMERS FROM
151,      REMOVING ANY SAFETY DEPOSIT BOX FROM THIS VIEWING AREA!
151,               Thank you for banking at the Zork!
152,You are in a room used by holders of safety deposit boxes to view
152,their contents.  On the north size of the room is a sign which says
152,
152,   REMAIN HERE WHILE THE BANK OFFICER RETRIEVES YOUR DEPOSIT BOX
152,    WHEN YOU ARE FINISHED, LEAVE THE BOX, AND EXIT TO THE SOUTH
152,     AN ADVANCED PROTECTIVE DEVICE PREVENTS ALL CUSTOMERS FROM
152,      REMOVING ANY SAFETY DEPOSIT BOX FROM THIS VIEWING AREA!
152,               Thank you for banking at the Zork!
153,You are in a small bare room with no distinguishing features.  There
153,are no exits from this room.
154,You are in the Vault of the Bank of Zork, in which there are no doors.
155,You are in a large rectangular room.  The east and west walls here
155,were used for storing safety deposit boxes.  As might be expected,
155,all have been carefully removed by evil persons.  To the east, west,
155,and south of the room are large doorways.  The northern "wall"
155,of the room is a shimmering curtain of light.  In the center of the
155,room is a large stone cube, about 10 feet on a side.  Engraved on
155,the side of the cube is some lettering.
156,This room was the office of the Chairman of the Bank of Zork.
156,Like the other rooms here, it has been extensively vandalized.
156,The lone exit is to the north.
158,You are standing at the top of a flight of stairs that lead down to
158,a passage below.  Dim light, as from torches, can be seen in the
158,passage.  Behind you the stairs lead into untouched rock.
159,You are standing near one end of a long dimly lit hall.  To the
159,south, stone stairs ascend.  To the north, the corridor is illum-
159,inated by torches set high in the wall, out of reach.  On one wall
159,is a red button.
180,You are in a corridor with polished marble walls.  The corridor
180,widens into larger areas as it turns east at its northern and
180,southern ends.
181,You are in a corridor with polished marble walls.  The corridor
181,widens into larger areas as it turns west at its northern and
181,southern ends.
187,You are in a room of large size, richly appointed and decorated
187,in a style that bespeaks exquisite taste.  To judge from its
187,contents, it is the ultimate storehouse of the treasures of Zork.
187,   There are chests here containing precious jewels, mountains of
187,Zorkmids, rare paintings, ancient statuary, and beguiling curios.
187,   In one corner of the room is a bookcase boasting such volumes
187,as "The History of the Great Underground Empire", "The Lives of
187,the Twelve Flatheads", "The Wisdom of the Implementers", and
187,other informative and inspiring works.
187,   On one wall is a completely annotated map of the Dungeon of
187,Zork, showing points of interest and various troves of treasure,
187,and indicating the locations of several superior scenic views.
187,   On the desk at the far end of the room may be found stock
187,certificates representing a controlling interest in FrobozzCo
187,International, the multinational conglomerate and parent company
187,of the Frobozz Magic Boat Co., etc.
187,
188,This is a lavish bedroom.  There is an expensive four posted brass
188,bed here.

14,On hooks above the mantlepiece hangs an elvish sword of great antiquity.
15,A battery-powered brass lantern is on the trophy case.
21,Beside the skeleton is a rusty knife.
22,The deceased adventurer's useless lantern is here.

121,There is a large pile of empty coke bottles here, evidently produced

149,A portrait of J. Pierpont Flathead hangs on the wall.
153,On the branch is a small birds nest.

154,apparently scavenged somewhere by a childless songbird.  The egg is
154,covered with fine gold inlay and ornamented in lapis lazuli and
154,mother-of-pearl.  Unlike most eggs, this one is hinged and has a
154,delicate looking clasp holding it closed.  The egg appears extremely
154,fragile.
157,There is a golden clockwork canary nestled in the egg.  It has ruby
157,eyes and a silver beak.  Through a crystal window below its left
157,winng you can see intricate machinery inside.  It appears to have

8,**** READING MATERIAL ****
41,The engravings were incised in the living rock of the cave wall by
41,an unknown hand.  They depict, in symbolic form, the beliefs of the
41,ancient peoples of Zork.  Skillfully interwoven with the bas reliefs
41,are excerpts illustrating the major tenets expounded by the sacred
41,texts of the religion of that time.  Unfortunately, a later age seems
41,to have considered them blasphemous and just as skillfully excised them.
44,The prayer is inscribed in an ancient script which is hardly
44,remembered these days, much less understood.  What little of it can
44,be made out seems to be a diatribe against small insects, absent-
44,mindedness, and the picking up and dropping of small objects.  The
44,final verse seems to consign trespassers to the land of the
44,dead.  All evidence indicates that the beliefs of the ancient
44,Zorkers were obscure indeed.
47,		Commandment #12592
47,Oh ye who go about saying unto each other:  "Hello sailor":
47,Dost thou know the magnitude of thy sin before the gods?
47,Yea, verily, thou shalt be ground between two stones.
47,Shall the angry gods cast thy body into the whirlpool?
47,Surely, thy eye shall be put out with a sharp stick!
47,Even unto the ends of the earth shalt thou wander and
47,unto the land of the dead shalt thou be sent at last.
47,Surely thou shalt repent of thy cunning.

49,		Flood Control Dam #3
49,
49,  Flood control dam #3 (FCD #3) was constructed in year 783 of the
49,Great Underground Empire to harness the destructive power of the
49,Frigid River.  This work was supported by a grant of 37 million
49,Zorkmids from the central bureaucracy and your own omnipotent local
49,tyrant Lord Dimwit Flathead the Excessive.  This impressive structure
49,is composed of 3.7 cubic feet of concrete, is 256 feet tall at the
49,center, and 193 feet wide at the top.  The reservoir created behind
49,the dam has a volume of 37 billion cubic feet, an area of 12 million
49,square feet, and a shore line of 37 thousand feet.
49,
49,  The construction of FCD #3 took 112 days from ground breaking to
49,the dedication.  It required a work force of 384 slaves, 34 slave
49,drivers, 12 engineers, 2 turtle doves, and a partridge in a pear
49,tree.  The work was managed by a command team composed of 234
49,bureaucrats, 2347 secretaries (at least two of whom could type),
49,12,256 paper shufflers, 52,469 rubber stampers, 245,193 red tape
49,processors, and nearly one million dead trees.
49,
49,  We will now point out some of the more interesting features of
49,FCD #3 as we conduct you on a guided tour of the facilities.

50,
50,The endgame is here!  (Somewhere)
50,Some parser cleanup has been done, as well as the new RNAME command
50,See the INFO command for more information.
50,
50,		--- BACKGROUND INFORMATION ---
50,
50,This version of Dungeon for New Mexico Tech has been completely
50,reimplemented in FORTRAN-IV from the original MDL sources created
50,at MIT.  The parser in this version is somewhat simpler than the
50,parser in the ARPAnet version;  within this limit, this version
50,is fully congruent with the current version on the ARPAnet.

51,Mr. TAA of Muddle, Mass. says:  "Before I took this course I used
51,to be a lowly bit twiddler.  Now with what I learned at MIT Tech
51,I feel really important and can obfuscate and confuse with the best."
51,
51,Mr. MARC had this to say:  "Ten short days ago all I could look
51,forward to was a dead-end job as a engineer.  Now I have a promising
51,future and make really big Zorkmids."
51,
51,MIT Tech can't promise these fantastic results to everyone, but when
51,you earn your MDL degree from MIT Tech your future will be brighter.

52,
52,   Dungeon is a game of adventure, danger, and low cunning.  In it
52,you will explore some of the most amazing territory ever seen by mortal
52,man.  Hardened adventurers have run screaming from the terrors contained
52,within.
52,
52,   In Dungeon, the intrepid explorer delves into the forgotten secrets
52,of a lost labyrinth deep in the bowels of the earth, searching for
52,vast treasures long hidden from prying eyes, treasures guarded by
52,fearsome monsters and diabolical traps!
52,
52,   No DECsystem should be without one!
52,
52,   Dungeon was created at the Programming Technology Division of the MIT
52,Laboratory for Computer Science by Tim Anderson, Marc Blank, Bruce
52,Daniels, and Dave Lebling.  It was inspired by the Adventure game of
52,Crowther and Woods, and the Dungeons and Dragons game of Gygax
52,and Arneson.  The original version was written in MDL (alias MUDDLE).
52,The current version was translated from MDL into FORTRAN IV by
52,a somewhat paranoid DEC engineer who prefers to remain anonymous.
52,
52,   On-line information may be obtained with the commands HELP and INFO.
67,The engravings translate to, "This space intentionally left blank".
