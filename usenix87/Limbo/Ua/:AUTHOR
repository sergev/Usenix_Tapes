The following "C" program is a "User Accounting" program designed
specifically for the 3B2 series of computers.  We (like others) found
that System V Release 2.2 for the 3B2 seems to have 'lost' several
parts of UNIX (:-) that were standard previously.

One of the worst losses as far as we were concerned was the system
accounting.  It is necessary for us as an educational institution to
keep track of who has been on the system and when.  The following
program, 'ua', takes care of this.

* CAVEATS *
Ua reads all of wtmp (basically) into memory as a binary sort tree.
As a result, it expects relatively short wtmp files (we clear ours
out each night).  If the tree overflows memory, the program will die
with a message, but not save and/or print any part of the tree.

Although the program has been tested, there are no guarantees that it
is entirely bugless.  Please send flames/questions/complaints to me at
the address below.  It works for the 3b2, anything else is anybodys
guess.  There are NO ifdef's for other system.

Hope this is somewhat useful!
