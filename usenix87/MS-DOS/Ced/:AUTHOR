[Here line-eater, nice line-eater.  Come and get your line!!!]

As asked for, here is CED version 1.0C.  It is in the normal shar file
stuff.  One of the files is the documentation and the other is a uuencoded
.COM file.  So, after getting CED.COM.U, run it through uudecode to get
CED.COM.  Then use whatever means you have to get it to your PC.

As usual, cut and save the stuff below the cut line.  Also remove the
.signature stuff at the end of this file, though I believe that shar
will ignore it.
