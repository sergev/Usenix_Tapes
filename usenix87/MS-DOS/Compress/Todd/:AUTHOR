The responses were overwhelming; everybody wanted this. Herewith: the
documentation and makefile in this posting, and C sources in a second,
to the port of compress(1) to MS-DOS under MSC 3.0. This version should
port to other micros more easily than the original, I would think.
Executables for this can be found in net.micro.pc. Read the C source for
the credits; I had nothing to do with the development of this excellent
piece of software, and credit for this work shouldn't be lost.
