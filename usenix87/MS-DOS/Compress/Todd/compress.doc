       NAME
            compress, uncompress, zcat - compress or expand data
       
       SYNOPSIS
            compress [-cdfivV] [-b bits] [name ...]
            uncompress [-cfivV] [name ...]
            zcat [-iV] [name ...]
       
       DESCRIPTION
            Compress reduces the size of the named files using
            adaptive Lempel-Ziv coding.  Whenever possible, each 
            file is replaced by one with the extension .Z or XZ, 
            while keeping the same modification times.  If no 
            files are specified, the standard input is 
            compressed to the standard output.  Compressed files 
            can be restored to their original form using 
            uncompress or zcat.
       
            The -c option makes compress/uncompress write to the
            standard output; no files are changed.  The 
            nondestructive behavior of zcat is identical to that
            of uncompress -c.
       
            The -d (decompress) option makes compress restore
            its input files to their normal form.  Uncompress is
            identical to compress with the -d option specified.
       
            The -f option will force compression of "name". This
            is useful for compressing an entire directory, even 
            if some of the files do not actually shrink.  If -f
            is not given, the user is prompted as to whether an 
            existing file should be overwritten. 
       
            The -i (image mode) option suppresses the
            transformation of text lines from MS-DOS (CR-LF 
            delimited) form to UNIX (LF delimited) form during 
            compression, and suppresses the reverse 
            transformation during decompression. 
       
            The -v (verbose) option causes a message to be
            printed, yielding the percentage of reduction for 
            each file compressed.

            The -V option causes the current version and compile
            options to be printed on stderr. 
       
            Compress uses the modified Lempel-Ziv algorithm
            popularized in "A Technique for High Performance 
            Data Compression", Terry A. Welch, IEEE Computer,
            vol. 17, no. 6 (June 1984), pp. 8-19.  Common 
            substrings in the file are first replaced by 9-bit 
            codes 257 and up.  When code 512 is reached, the 
            algorithm switches to 10-bit codes and continues to 
            use more bits until the limit specified by the -b
            flag is reached (default is the maximum for which 
            the program was built). 
       
            "Bits" must be between 9 and the lesser of 16, and 
            the limit imposed at compile-time.  The MS-DOS 
            version of compress comes in two sizes.  One has a
            12-bit limit, and will run in a machine with 128K 
            bytes of available user memory.  The other has a 
            16-bit limit, and requires about 450K bytes to run. 
       
            After the "bits" limit is attained, compress
            periodically checks the compression ratio.  If it is 
            increasing, compress continues to use the existing
            code dictionary.  However, if the compression ratio 
            decreases, compress discards the table of substrings
            and rebuilds it from scratch.  This allows the 
            algorithm to adapt to the next "block" of the file. 
       
            Note that the -b flag is omitted for uncompress,
            since the "bits" parameter specified during 
            compression is encoded within the output, along with 
            a magic number to ensure that neither decompression 
            of random data nor recompression of compressed data 
            is attempted. 
       
            The amount of compression obtained depends on the 
            size of the input, the number of "bits" per code, 
            and the distribution of common substrings.  
            Typically, text such as source code or English is 
            reduced by 50-60%.  Compression is generally much

            better than that achieved by Huffman coding (as used 
            in SQ), and takes less time to compute. 
       
            Exit status is normally 0; if the last file is 
            larger after (attempted) compression, the status is 
            2; if an error occurs, exit status is 1.

       DIAGNOSTICS
            Usage: compress [-cdfivV] [-b maxbits] [file ...] 
                Invalid options were specified on the command 
                line. 
            Missing maxbits
                Maxbits must follow -b. 
            file: not in compressed format
                The file specified to UNCOMPRESS has not been 
                compressed. 
            file: compressed with xx bits, can only handle yy bits 
                "File" was compressed by a program that could 
                deal with more "bits" than the compress code on 
                this machine.  Recompress the file with smaller 
                "bits". 
            file: already has xx suffix -- no change
                The file is assumed to be already compressed 
                because the last two characters of its extension 
                are ".Z" or "XZ".  Rename the file and try 
                again. 
            fn: part of filename extension will be replaced by XZ
                File name, fn, contains at least two characters 
                in the "extension" field.  The second and third 
                will be replaced by "XZ" in the compressed 
                file's name. 
            fn already exists; do you wish to overwrite fn?
                Respond "y" if you want the output file, fn, to 
                be replaced; "n" if not. 
            Compression: xx.xx%
                Percentage of the input saved by compression. 
                (Relevant only for -v.) 
            -- file unchanged
                No savings is achieved by compression.  The

       BUGS
            Although compressed files are compatible between 
            machines with large memory, -b12 should be used for 
            file transfer to architectures with a small process 
            data space (64KB or less, as exhibited by the DEC 
            PDP series, or the small MS-DOS version, for 
            example). 
       
            MS-DOS version 2 does not permit a program to 
            determine the name used to call it.  As a result, 
            the aliases, uncompress and zcat, cannot be used.
            They can be used under MS-DOS version 3, though the 
            actual file name for uncompress will be
            "uncompre.exe". 
       
            MS-DOS does not support UNIX-style file links.  As a 
            result, even though compress, uncompress and zcat
            are all the same program, it (they) will have to be 
            stored three times, once under each of the three 
            names, in order to use them under MS-DOS version 3.  
            As explained in the previous paragraph, this is not 
            an option under MS-DOS version 2.
