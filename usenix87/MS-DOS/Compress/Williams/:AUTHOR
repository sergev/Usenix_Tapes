Here is source that will compile with AZTEC C86.  Define AZTEC86 and compile it.
it is completely self-contained - no makefile. Just "cc -dAZTEC86 compress ;
ln compress.o -lc".

It also has defines for the Metaware compiler, but since that is not yet very
popular, I won't include the functions that Metaware lacks (stat and utime).
