This program is mostly the result of a hard weekend's work.  Some
people came to me with something that needed to be printed in time for
the 350th celebration of Harvard. This was on a friday and the printer's
deadline was tuesday. So this program is targeted to the requirements
of this specific text.

Note also that I am a manager and instructor ( those that can't do -
teach ) and not a programmer so this is weak C and has only been tested
under 4.3BSD but should be portable.

A DCA input document will be turned into useful troff but most page
setups will be lost.  All "required carrier returns", centering
forced page ends etc will be reflected in the troff output, but margins
and the like will not be. 

Underlineing is turned into italic, and font changes try to do the right
thing. Troff comment lines are insterted for many "interesting" DCA
commands.

The file "opts" is what I would do if I had the time.

You may want to do some local mods in the files do_spchar.c and 
do_accent.c, they are set up for our imagen fonts.

please send me any bugs/fixes/updates
