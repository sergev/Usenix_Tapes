        Here it is, DOSAMATIC ! For the uninitiated, DOSAMATIC is a
program that allows an IBM PC or compatible to have several programs in
memory simultaneously, although only one can be active at a time.  In
addition, it has a visual DOS shell and many other useful features.
        The following articles should contain DOSAMATC.COM (uuencoded,
and in two pieces), DOSAMATC.HLP (the help file, also uuencoded),
DOSAMATC.TXT (user's manual) and an archive containing a read.me file
and miscellaneous batch files. I've treated the batch files as binary
files so as to keep the graphic characters, so use binary or image mode
when transfering them to your PC. And of course, set the file type (for
Kermit or similar programs) to image or binary when transfering
DOSAMATC.COM and DOSAMATC.HLP.
        The uuencoded DOSAMATC.COM file was cut into two parts in hopes
of avoiding truncation by the mailer. You'll have to reassemble them,
perhaps with an editor, or by using "cat" after cutting away mailer
debris. I'm sorry for that inconvience, but I believe having the file
amputated would be much worse.
        Enjoy!
