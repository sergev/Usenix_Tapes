The problem uudecoding dosamatic (and arc, for that matter) is that postnews
adds some blank lines to the end of each article.  These lines have to be
deleted before joining the two halves of the shar file together.  I have
succesfully downloaded both dosamatic and arc500 from the postings on this
newsgroup.  My suggestion for future postings of this type are to split
the uuencoded file BEFORE sharing it, then sharing each piece as separate
files.  The two files could be combined using cat, then uudecoded.

I'm surprised uudecode didn't complain.  Maybe it doesn't do any type
of crc or error checking.
