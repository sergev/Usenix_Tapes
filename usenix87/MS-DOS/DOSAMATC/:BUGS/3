I too need help with DOSAMATIC, but not to get it working on the PC: that
was no problem. There are a few minor bugs that annoy me, namely

1. When the menu says 'show hidden files' it actually means do not show them.
2. When asking to execute a batch file it says 'Enter Command:" when it
   really wants the parameters only.
3. I cannot find a way to stop it always asking me if what I want to do
   is a graphics program (it never is).
4. I am not sure that it always indicates the correct number of subtasks.
5. etc. etc.

BUT
my main gripe is that my version is always hanging up the XT needing a
hard boot. I just did it again, running dosamatic under itself (stupid
twit that I am). Am I alone in having problems, or is it all a ploy to
get me to pay my money and receive the latest and greatest version?
Personally, I would happily pay (or negociate a site-wide license), but
only after ensuring that the goods are worth the price. Every need for
a time-consuming hard boot reduces the price which I think it is worth.
