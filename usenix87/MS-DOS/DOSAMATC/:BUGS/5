More DOSAMATIC problems:-

1. With LASTDRIVE=Z the left-hand side list of units gets all screwed
   up: when I use via MS-NET on virtual disk E it reads (from the top)
   B C D E E F G H ....
   with the second E blinking. Moving the cursor up gets it correct, but
   then moving it down towards Z screws it again.
2. I would like to set up various defaults, such as showing hidden files,
   sorting by date and time etc.
3. Copying a whole directory.

It ain't bad, though.
