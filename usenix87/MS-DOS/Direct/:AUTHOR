Several weeks ago, James Gillogly submitted this routine, directory(),
for manipulating MS/PC-DOS directories.  While it was quite useful,
I've found that there were some things that I really needed; the
result is the modified directory routine below.  It's been in use for
some time now, so I think all the bugs are out.  Specifically, the
changes I added are:

	- Provided a calling convention for the release of the
	  acquired memory. (If processing multiple wildcard entries
	  on the same command line, the old version ate memory)

	- Converted to run under both Aztec and Lattice 'C'

	- Modified returned namelist so that it's a null-terminated
	  list of pointers, a la 'argv'

	- Provided an externally defined flag that allows the savvy
	  user to specify inclusion or exclusion of different file
	  types; most useful for finding subdirectories.

	- Modified so that it returns the full path, and the drive
	  specifier if provided, rather than just the filename.  This
	  makes the returned filename strings directly usable by
	  routines such as 'open', 'creat', etc.

I hope you find these useful; I have.
