     Here is the disk test software that was advertised last week in
net.micro.pc.  This is only the executable and the document.  Those who
want the sources right away should send me a self-addressed, STAMPED
disk mailer and a blank disk. The sources may be posted to the net
in the future, but I'm not sure when.

     To extract both the document and the executable from this file, do
the following:
	1. Delete all the lines up to and including the line that says
	   "Cut Here".
	2. Type "sh file", where `file' is the name of the file you
	   just deleted the lines from.  This will create dtest.exe and
	   dtest.1 in the current directory.
To get the manual pages, type "nroff -man dtest.1".

     Feel free to give the software away to anyone you like.  Selling
it for profit is strictly frowned upon.
