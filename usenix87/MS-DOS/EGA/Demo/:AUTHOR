This is a little demo program that takes advantage of the 
640X350 by 16 color graphics capabilities of the IBM Enhanced Graphics
Adapter when used with the Enhanced Color Monitor.  As yet, TURBO
doesn't support this particular mode, so I've used interrupt 10H for
all the plotting.  The graphics primitives that are used are 
plot_point, and plot_line (draw a line).
