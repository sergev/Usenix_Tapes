Following is the shar file for switching an EGA board in EGA mode to CGA
mode (and back). It has been tried on IBM and QUAD EGA boards, and seems to
work correctly. It will allow running of programs which will not run when
the CGA mode is selected from switches (S1?).

Included is code to switch into 43 line mode. Now if someone finds this
useful and got all the parts of the 43 line version of emacs, they could
mail it to me as a thank you.

The first file is the (ha) documentation I got with these files.
