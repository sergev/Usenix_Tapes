I'd be curious to hear your report on how well (or not well) these two
programs run on some boards other than the "real" EGA.  They seem to run
flawlessly on it; as a matter of fact, some software which will NOT run
on the EGA with Switch 1 set to CGA, WILL run if you set the switch to EGA
mode and then reset the mode with this software.  I'm interested in
knowing if it works that well on other EGA-type boards.  Note that I
have also provided source code for both EGA.ASM and CGA.ASM.
