Not dangerous at all... I simply forgot to update CapCol in making the
modification! The mod was made simply because the writechars() function
is more direct than multiple calls to outchar(). I really appreciate the bug
fix since the bug was almost impossible for me to consistantly duplicate.
You can leave in the call to writechars(), adding the CapCol update:

#ifdef UNIX		/*cfh was here 8/31/85 */
		for (i = 0; i < num; i++) {
			outchar(new[i]);
			CapCol++;
		}
#else {			/*cfh was here 8/31/85 */
		writechars(new,new +num -1);
		CapCol += num;
	}
#endif	
	} else {
	     ins_mode();

The conread() routine has since been modified, along with changes in
funcs.c, to support all keys, including the arrow and function key
sequences. If Jove again becomes available, I will make these changes
available.


Thanks for the changes... after getting Jove running I simply have not had
much time to devote to it. I have fixed a few bugs and added some features,
and am working on "shell-in-a-window." Until "re.c" and "temp.c" are
rewritten, however, I will not be posting anything on the net.
