Below is  the  latest  version  of a VMS-like HELP for MS/PC-DOS.  This version
(1.1 [15]) adds the following functionality.

    .  Lookup tables to allow help topic entry names longer than 8 characters.
    .  Internal 'more' (requires installtion of ANSI.SYS) used by default.
    .  External 'cat','more' or 'type' command/program may be used in place of
       the internal 'more'
    .  Environment variables are used to specify the help directory root (HELP)
       and the external viewing program (PIPE) if used.
    .  An interrupt handler has been added to trap control-C.
    

Following is an  ARC  file  which  has  obviously  been uuencoded.  Both source
and executable are included.

Good luck,
