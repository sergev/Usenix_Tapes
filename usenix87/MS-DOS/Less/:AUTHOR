The following is a shar'd file containing less.uue which is a full
implementation of less (version 48) that will run on msdos computers.
It will run on systems with graphics or monochrome monitors with no
special action taken. (Looks for itself to see which is being used)
It has been reasonable well tested but if there is any problem let me
know. The source code is not included but can be readily made available
if you want it. All comments and flames to -
