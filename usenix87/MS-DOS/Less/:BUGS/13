This is the only place I can think of to post bug-related info about stuff from
mod.sources...

I compiled the last posting of less(1), and found that (on HP terminals at
least) when you scroll backwards and then quit or jump to a different
location in the file your screen gets messed up because the contents of the
screen BELOW the cursor weren't cleared.

The fix is trivial... in screen.c, make the following change:

223c223
< 	sc_eol_clear = (dumb) ? NULL : tgetstr("ce", &sp);
---
> 	sc_eol_clear = (dumb) ? NULL : tgetstr("cd", &sp);

This simply does a "Clear to end of screen" instead of "clear to end of line"
whenever the cursor is moved to the lower left corner of your screen.
This fixes the problem on HP terminals; I don't know about other terminal
types.
