I am not sure what less uses `sc_eol_clear' for; but if the intention
is to clear to end of line, use `ce'; if it is to clear to the end
of the screen, use `cd'---but fake it if it is not available.
There is a termcap flag that indicates whether reverse scrolling
leaves text below the visible screen bottom.  It is `db'.  There
is a corresponding flag named `da', display retained above, that
indicates whether reverse scrolling may redisplay old scrolled
text.
