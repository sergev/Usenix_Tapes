	I liked the pager "less" recently posted to net.sources, of course,
most importantly its ability to go backwards. However a number of "features"
I didn't like and have changed. Most try to make it more compatible with more(1)

	- less supports the -s option to squeeze multiple empty lines. This
		feature is used by man(1) which has been changed to look for
		alternative pagers in $PAGER and $MANPAGER.

	- less understands ^F, ^B, ^U, ^D as VI/more commands for f, b, u, d.

	- less understands "v" to jump into $EDITOR or VI.

	- less will quit or go to the next file after hitting the EOF of a file
		twice in a row. The distributed less can only be exited by "q".

	- less will act like cat(1)/more(1) if its standard output is not a
		terminal. Otherwise commands like:

			less file > junk

		will just sit there as will (depending on man),

			man topic | lpr

	If people are interested in these mods, I will post them...
	Perhaps someone with System 5 could tell me how pg(1) handles these and
similar issues...
