I use less now as my pager and I usually pipe things into. I am one
of those stop a job and startup another (usually about three stopped
at a time). What I noticed is sometimes I would stop a command
like "diff a b |less" and only the diff would be stopped, the less
would continue waiting thus I don't get me back control of
the terminal.  It happens off and on without any apparent pattern,
anybody else notice this?
