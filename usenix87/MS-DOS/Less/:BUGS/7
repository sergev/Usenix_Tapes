I experienced this problem when I used a version of man(1) I hacked to allow it
to use less.  The problem is in the routine psignals, in signal.c (less' signal
handler).  There is some code near the end of this routine to clean up the
terminal before sending itself the SIGTSTP signal.  The problem is that this
code was executing with SIGTTOU enabled, creating a race condition where
sometimes the shell would grab control of the terminal before less had a chance
to clean it up.  I also took out the flush() call, as this sometimes caused
the shell prompt not to be printed.

Old code:

		/*
		 * Clean up the terminal.
		 */
		lower_left();
		clear_eol();
		flush();
		raw_mode(0);
		SIGNAL(SIGTSTP, SIG_DFL);

Changed code:

		/*
		 * Clean up the terminal.  Ignore SIGTTOU while cleaning up
		 * so we don't get stopped half-way if the shell grabs control
		 * of the terminal.
		 */

		signal(SIGTTOU, SIG_IGN);
		lower_left();
		clear_eol();
		raw_mode(0);
	        signal(SIGTTOU, SIG_DFL);
		SIGNAL(SIGTSTP, SIG_DFL);
