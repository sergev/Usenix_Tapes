Here is an updated version of less for msdos. Fixes for:
	1. Use on any combination of pc monitor/card combination.
	2. Redirection and piping ok now.
This posting will be followed by a posting of the full source code
that will be in three parts. This uuencoded exe is for people who
don't have the compiler nor the inclination to compile the source
if they don't have to. Please send any comments or problem reports
to me at ...!seismo!rochester!kodak!keily (learned how to spell sizemoe)
This should answer any mail responses that I recently received. I
consider all mail answered by this posting. Send mail again and you
shall be answered. Enjoy.
