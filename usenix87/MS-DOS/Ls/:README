This version (v2.0) of "ls" for MS-DOS is functionally similar to the
Unix utility "ls" with a few modifications for use in the MS-DOS
environment.  It is an improved version of the program submitted to
net.sources two years ago, and includes the following changes:

     o Automatically adapts to path separators "/" or "\", whichever
       is in normal use;
     o Identifies directories by absolute pathnames, starting at root;
     o A new option (-i) suppresses directory names to permit output
       filenames to be used elesewhere (e.g. in executable .bat files);
     o Permits customizing long and short listing formats separately;
     o Has a few bugs fixed (e.g. accepts filenames in ALL CAPS);
     o Has been separated into individual source files, and has a Makefile;
     o Compiles under Microsoft C (v 3.x or later), CI-C86 and DeSmet C;
     o Includes a uuencoded executable file preconfigured with the best
       possible choices for display format (i.e. the way I like it).

Please submit any bug reports to me.  The present version has been in Beta
test for several months, and I am not aware of any bugs, but Murphy's law
has not been repealed ...
