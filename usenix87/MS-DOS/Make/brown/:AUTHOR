About a year ago, Landon Dyer posted a version of MAKE for the IBM PC.
This had some problems, most notably that it would not directly execute
programs.  Therefore, I hacked it up and added direct execution of programs
and some features that I needed in a make, most notably, extraction 
of files from archives.  This posting contains the MAKE sources and the
sources for an archiver called LAR, which is similar to LU except that
the date and time are preserved in the archive.  MAKE can examine LAR 
format files and conditionally extract files from the archive.

Both MAKE and LAR were written in Wizard C.  They depend on a number
of include files being present, and on a number of library functions. 
Most of the dependencies are localized to LWTOL.C, execute.c, parsedir.c,
and getdir.c.  Some functions such as _open, _close, _read, and _write
are binary versions of the standard unix open, close, etc.

No guarantees are made about the portability of these programs.
