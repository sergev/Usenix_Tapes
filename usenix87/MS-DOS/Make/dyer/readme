Last month I wrote a version of the Unix(tm) utility MAKE.  It runs under
VAX/VMS and MSDOS 2.0.  I am placing it in the public domain, and it is yours
for the asking.  You may copy it, or give it away.  You can make any changes
you like to it.  All I ask is that you DO NOT TRY TO SELL IT.

Anyway, there is now a MAKE for MSDOS.  It is free, and it works pretty well.
I'm giving it away because it might do the world some good.  Who knows?

Caveat: this version of MAKE is NOT compatible with the Unix(tm) version.
Some differences are explained in the documentation.  Most of the problem stems
from the fact that I've never had a chance to use the original version of MAKE,
and the documentation I've seen on it has been poor.  My idea of what a make
program should do is almost certainly different from what you Unix(tm) hackers
are used to.  Well, hell -- the software is worth what you paid for it.  Have
fun.

In order to get MAKE running on your system, you need to:

	1.  Read the documentation file MAKE.MAN.  (Yes, read the
	    directions.)

	2.  Edit the file MAKE.H to represent your system (VAX/VMS or
	    MSDOS 2.0.)

	3.  Recompile the source code by following the script file
	    CMAKE.COM (for VAX/VMS) or CMAKE.BAT (for MSDOS 2.0.)

	    VAX/VMS requires the DEC C compiler; MSDOS 2.0 requires
	    Lattice C (or another C compiler of comparable quality)
	    and the Macro Assembler.

	4.  Test out MAKE by running it on itself.  (Make a backup
	    first!)
