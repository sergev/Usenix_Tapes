Here is an update to PC-More which fixes its problems with color monitors.
This new version will run on either a monochrome system or a color system.
No patching is necessary.  What follows is the modifications to the source
code and the User's Guide.

                         PC-More Update to Version 1.21

In the source file for PC-More, make the following changes:

    1)  At the beginning of the file is an external declaration

            int x_mnl, x_srf, x_argc;

        Add (*cls)() to this declaration to declare an external pointer
        to a function.

    2)  In the function main(), there is an int declaration statement at the
        beginning of the function.  Add crt_mono() and crt_cls() to this
        declaration to define 2 functions which return integers.  Actually,
        they don't return anything, but they must be declared for the following
        step to work.

    3)  In the function main(), add the following lines of code after the
        first three executable lines of the function.  These first three
        lines follow the commented section describing the variables used
        in main() and copy argc and argv[] into external variables.  The
        new lines of code to add are:

    if ((peek(0x410,0) & 0x30) != 0x30) /* This finds if a CGA is used. */
        cls = cls_cga;  /* If using CGA, use appropriate cls function. */
    else                /* If not using a CGA, then using monochrome, */
        cls = cls_mono; /* so use monochrome cls function. */

        These new lines become the 4th - 7th executable lines in main().

    4)  Replace all occurences of 

            crt_cls();
            crt_mode(7);

        with

            (*cls)();

    5)  Define the following 2 functions in the source code file:

cls_mono()  /* Clears the screen on a monochrome monitor. */

{
    crt_cls();
    crt_mode(7);
}


crt_cga()   /* Clears the screen on a color graphics adapter. */

{
    crt_cls();
    crt_mode(2);
}

    6)  In the function wait(), find the "case 'v':" part to the switch.
        In the printf() function, change "PC-More v1.2" to "PC-More v1.21".

This completes the modification of the source code for PC-More.


Add the following paragraph to the PC-More User's Guide, Section 4, after
the discussion about key_getc(), crt_cls(), and crt_mode():

    peek()      This function returns the value of a word in memory.  The
                exact syntax is:

                    unsigned offset;    /* Offset relative to */
                    unsigned seg;       /*  a segment value. */
                    int peek(), i;

                    i = peek(offset,seg);

                The C86 manual is not clear on the matter of what a word is
                in this context.  I assume that they mean 2 bytes, which is
                consistant with the meaning used elsewhere in the manual.
                Since an int is 2 bytes long, this seems to be what they mean.

This completes the modification of the PC-More User's Guide.
