The following uuencoded source file is a short RAM-resident program for
the IBM-PC and MS-DOS compatibles.  NPAD is a notepad that allows you to
make notes on your screen, and not interrupt your current task.  It's not
quite as nice as Sidekick, but is still handy when there are a few notes 
that are for scratch, remember line numbers in a program, and various other
short notes.  

To execute NPAD.COM, just type NPAD.  To activate the notepad, use Ctrl-N.
To erase the notepad, the Delete key.   Ctrl-N is the toggle between DOS,
and the notepad.
 
If anyone is interested in the assembler source, I can probably dig it
up and send it via e-mail.  The original source was given to me by someone
who typed it in, but didn't write it themselves, and to the best of my
knowledge *is* public domain (no copywrite is stamped anywhere in the source,
or compiled file).

If you have questions, or anything, just write.
