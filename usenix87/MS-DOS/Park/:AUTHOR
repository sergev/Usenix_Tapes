[Oh No!  My head didn't park?!  Instead it landed!!!!!?]

Here is a little ditty that I got from the PC bulletin board world.
I haven't installed it yet, but will be doing so right after this gets
posted.

If you have the program TIMEPARK, make sure you replace it with this version,
1.1, as there were a couple of minor things in it.

As usual, this is a shar file.  You know the rules.  It contains a uuencoded
file TIMEPARK.UUENCODE, which, when uudecoded, becomes TIMEPARK.COM.

Be sure to remove the .signature from the end of this file.
