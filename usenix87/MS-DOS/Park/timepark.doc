                       VERSION 1.1   03/19/86

The ARCHED distribution contains the following files:

    1) TIMPARK1.ASM     The assembly source
    2) TIMEPARK.COM     The load module
    3) TIMEPARK.DOC     This miserable manual

This software is placed in the PUBLIC DOMAIN to be used for NON-COMMERCIAL
purposes only. Absolutely NOTHING may be charged for its use. Also, all
three files MUST be passed on.

The above software has been tested on an IBM-AT and a Compaq portable and
should perform as stated on all other near compatibles.

The software is supplied AS IS and absolutely NO guarantees are given or
implied about its suitability.

Well, so much for that, now here is what it will do for you:

One of the major concerns about using a hard disk is its continuous rotation
during its usage. I, like many other SYSOPs, have hard disks spinning
24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Even though there are many periods in the
day that the BBS is being used on a continuous basis, there are also periods
where it isn't used for some time. The heads are positioned on the recording
surface and may touch for one reason or another. Therefore, this program
is one answer to the problem. What this will do is park the heads of the
hard disk after so much time of non-use. The heads will be re-positioned
after the next disk access is requested. The event timer is automatically
reset after each and every hard disk access ( INT 13H ). Therefore, it
is quit possible that you may never see it park during normal operation.
The program will park drive C and, if present, drive D.

To use the program, simply type or put in your batch file:

                  TIMEPARK N

                           Where N is the number of minutes that you
                           will allow before the disk parking takes place.

 Please note that the range of N is 1-9; therefore you can select
 one minute to nine minutes before the heads park. I could have made
 the range longer; however, I felt that 9 minutes without usage was MORE
 than enough.

 An example of a five minute period is:

                   TIMEPARK 5

Please note that this software was first place on my BBS on the 13th
of March, 1986.

               7 days a week,  24 hours a day

Enjoy,

ERRATA:  Version 1.1

The software NOW takes over part of the BIOS 1C interrupt! Also, it
now performs a seek instead of a verify. The parking software is also
removed from the interrupt service routine and is a STAND ALONE memory
resident program which is executed prior to the return to the main
program.

In the original version, it was possible under certain applications to
loose time while the disks are parking, in this version, NO TIME SHOULD
BE LOST NOR SHOULD YOU NOTICE A KEYBOARD LOCKUP WHILE THE DISKS ARE
PARKING!

NOTE:

The author's phone number has been changed and is corrected above.
The BBS number is inactive, for a little while.  The computer is being
moved to a new location.   Mike Brown SYSOP NICBUL RBBS  (4/08/86)
