	Here is a source file for some useful Lattice C routines for
MS-DOS. These are for the Lattice C 'L' or large memory model. They
include 3 very useful functions. setjmp(), longjmp(), and _envget().
The setjmp() and longjmp() require a header file with a declaration
for the type 'jmpbuf' this should be a 10 integer array. You should
assemble it with MASM and make sure that the file LM8086 is present,
this is provided with the compiler. Note that _envget() can be used
to implement the getenv() call with a little bit of 'C'. I am now
using these routines in a Lisp interpreter where setjmp() and 
longjmp() get lots of exercise to say the least! Look for the Lisp
interpreter uuencoded executable Real Soon Now!

	Oh, these are for Lattice version 2.03 and I do not know 
if they will work with later/earlier versions but I would be
surprised if they did not.
