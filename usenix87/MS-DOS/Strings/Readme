People who write "Trojan Horse" programs seem to want to gloat about it,
and must include their "gloats" in some printable form in the executable
program itself.  The "str" program is modeled on the Unix utility "strings"
which searches an executable file for ASCII strings and sends any it can
identify to stdout.  It detects several different types of strings used in
the MD-DOS operating system and utilities.  

This is no final answer to software terrorism, of course, but I hope it can
save a few people from unexpected grief.

I have included the executable program in "uuencoded" form -- to recover the
original, use "uudecode" to get the file "str.exe" and then down-load it to
your PC using some form of binary transfer: "kermit -si" or xmodem.
