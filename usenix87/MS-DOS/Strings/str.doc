             str - find the ASCII strings in a binary file

Syntax:   str [-l## -t##] [filename ...]

Options:  -l##   Set the minimum length of an unterminated string to ##
                 [default is 6]
          -t##   Set the minimum length of a terminated string to ##
                 [default is 4]

Str searches through a binary file (e.g. a .exe or .com file) and sends any 
ASCII strings it finds to stdout.  It defines a string as an uninterrupted 
sequence of printable ASCII characters terminated by a NULL, newline or return 
code (terminated string), or ended by a non-printable ASCII code (unterminated 
string).  If the ending code is a printable ASCII character with the 8th bit 
set, the character is printed at the end of the string, else it is ignored.  
Each string is printed on a separate line and will wrap if the string is 
longer than 80 characters. If output is to the screen the display will pause 
every 22 lines; if output is redirected no pause occurs.
