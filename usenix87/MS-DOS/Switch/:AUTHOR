The following program lets you check or set the DOS "switch" character.
This restores the ability (lost in DOS 3.x) to use the SWITCHAR option
in CONFIG.SYS. The default "switch" character is "/"; if any other
character is used instead (e.g. "-" a la Un*x), then "/" may be used
as a path-separator (again, a la Un*x). This is not an officially-
supported feature of DOS; some system programs and many application
programs may not act as if the switch character is changed. But if
you get bent out of shape by having to do running "\"-for-"/"
substitutions when you are running DOS, then this baby is for you.
It runs under any version of PC or MS-DOS between 2.00 and 3.10. It
may not work on later versions. Caveat emptor.

This is, of course, a shell archive; follow the instructions and
feed it to /bin/sh or unshar.
