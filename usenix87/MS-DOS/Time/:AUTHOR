Here's a little function that emulates the time(2) Unix system call under
MS-DOS.  It requires six little assembly language routines to return the
various components of the date and time from DOS calls 2A (get date) and
2C (get time).  These routines are called dos_day, dos_hour, etc. and are
left as an exercise for the reader.
