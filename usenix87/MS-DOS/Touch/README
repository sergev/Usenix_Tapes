This distribution contains a hastily slapped together 'touch' and an even
  hastier 'chmod' function for the IBM-PC running DOS 2.X.  Both are designed
  to be compiled with the Microsoft C Compiler 3.0.

'touch' is an attempt to match the action of the Unix 'touch' command as 
  closely as possible (as opposed to an attempt to define a touch with 
  reasonable semantics).  Thus, touching a non-existant file causes it
  to be created, when possible.  Non-expandable wildcard characters cause
  immediate termination of execution, regardless whether other file specs
  in the file list are valid, just as if the shell had found a problem and
  reported it.  The faulty semantics of the DOS '?' wildcard are reflected
  in the execution of this program because of the cheap and easy manner in
  which the expansion is implemented.

'chmod' is a limited command to change the mode of its arguments to read/write
  or read-only, the only supported modes in MS-DOS.  So sloppy is my work
  here that, although I hear that DOS 3.0 provides such a command, I didn't
  bother to walk down the hall to check it out.  Ah, the perils of public
  domain.

To compile either file, type

	cl -c x.c
	cl -o x x.obj ssetargv.obj

   where x is either 'chmod' or 'touch'.  Ssetargv is required to expand the
   wildcard characters.  Note that I have followed the suggested Microsoft
   conventions for which files to place in the 'sys' subdirectory of the
   'include' subdirectory.
