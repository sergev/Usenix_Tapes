The following are two programs that use undocumented features of DOS
to display interesting information about the PC environment.  I believe
that these programs run under PC DOS 2.0, 2.1, 3.0, and 3.1 (as well as
the corresponding MS versions), but as with all undocumented features:
caveat programmer.

The first program, LDEVS, opens an FCB to the NUL: device and uses an
undocumented field of the FCB (which is different for DOS 2 and 3) to
find the start of the device chain.  It then traces the chain displaying
the name and type of all devices.

The second program, MSCAN, uses an undocumented DOS function (52H - Get
In Vars) to find the first memory block, and then prints out information
about all memory blocks.  I'm not sure what "Get In Vars" does, but it
seems to return a pointer into the middle of a DOS data block.
