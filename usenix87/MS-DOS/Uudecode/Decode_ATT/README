Here are versions of uuencode and uudecode that will work on an IBM
PC.  There is a version for Turbo Pascal and one for Microsoft C.
Porting them into other machines, languages or dialects should not
pose a large problem.

Sorry about the lack of documentation, but the programs are easy to
use, so you should not have a problem.  I don't know why a UNIX
site would not have these in the first place, but at least your
manual should tell you how to use them.  If you are not using UNIX
at all, you have my sympathy.

The Pascal programs' author is unknown.  The C programs were
provided by Don Kneller.
