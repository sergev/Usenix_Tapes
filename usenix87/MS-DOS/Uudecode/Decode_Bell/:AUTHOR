Not having uudecode available myself, I ended up creating my
own version.  This was used to decode pc-lisp without any 
problems.  For those who don't have uudecode, enjoy.  For
those on BSD systems, ignore.  This was NOT written for the
PC, but should be portable enough to work without to much
modification.

This is released to the public.
