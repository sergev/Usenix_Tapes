About 3 days ago I posted a request for code that implements uuencode and
uudecode under MS-DOS.  I received two very good responses.  One was source
code written in Turbo Pascal, the other in C.  Since I don't have a C compiler,
I used the Turbo sources (I have Turbo V3.0).  They work great.  Today I saw
the following message, so I thought I would go ahead and post the sources I
received.

( Note: now if I could only get code that would perform Unix's /bin/sh
  under MS-DOS.... )

P.S. - To the person (henry) who mailed me the Turbo source code, I regret that
       I inadvertantly lost your full name, so I am unable to give you credit
       for the code.  However, I thank you for it very much, and I hope others
       will find it as useful as I did.

	First, the Turbo Pascal version :


*********************************************************************


Here are the sources.  Using the programs is easy.  To use uuencode type

>uuencode source target

where source is the source file name, and target is the target file name.
If target has no extension, then uuencode will add the extension .uue.  If
you omit target, uuencode will use the source file name with the extension
.uue.

To use uudecode, type

>uudecode source

where source is the name of the uuencoded file.  If you omit the extension on
source, uudecode will add .uue.

Let me know if you need more help.

regards,
henry
