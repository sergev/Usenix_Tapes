I am afraid I posted a little too soon. I apologize. Some of you may already
have noticed that the diplay of the remaining bytes is erroneous for large
files. In fact for a file larger than 65535 bytes, it's incorrect. The   
reason is that the FileSize function of TP returns an integer. I believe I
have to use a DOS call to get the actual size. When I get a fix, I'll post.
So hang on. In the mean time you can still use the programs. No harm. Your
files will still be uudecoded/encoded. Just the count displayed will be 
incorrect. At least your screen won't scroll.
