A  while ago I posted a UUDECODE program, written in Microsoft Basic, to
net.sources. Judging from the  number  of  replies  I  had,  people  are
finding  this  useful  if  they  don't  have access to the public domain
UUDECODE, or to a C compiler.

I found one or two problems recently; the main one was that it would not
create an output file of more than 64K due to an undocumented feature of
MS-BASIC. Here is a corrected version; as always, I suggest you  compile
it if you want the run time to be finite.
