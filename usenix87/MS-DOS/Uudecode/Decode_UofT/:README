I have made a simple patch which puts a checksum character at the end of each
line.  Files uuencoded with this new uuencode can be uudecoded with the old
uudecode without complaint.  If you use this uudecode on a file uuencoded
with the old uuencode, every line gives a checksum error, so I have made it
report only the first five checksum errors.  Therefore, if you get errors
saying that there is a checksum error on lines 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, you can
presume that the file you are uudecoding was uuencoded without checksums.

To the best of my knowledge uuen/decode are public domain.  If they are not
and I am flamed I will immediately cancel this article and instead post
context diffs or something.  The reason I am posting the programs intact is
that when I context-diffed them the resulting output was considerably
longer than the files themselves.

Also: flames to /dev/null if you don't like my sccsids.  I don't know how
they work and don't care; you are free to edit it as required.  "Dash one"
to me means "minor edit #1".
