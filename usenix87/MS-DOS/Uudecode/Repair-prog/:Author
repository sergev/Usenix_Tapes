It seems that some uuencoded postings are being stripped of trailing
spaces.  This program was posted in comp.sys.ibm.pc  but apparently most
people missed it.  I've used it on a couple of files that were altered
and it seems to work.
Please consider posting it here.

The reason is that some mailer, somewhere, removed all of the trailing space.
Uudecode don't like it (at least here).  So, I wrote a little program to put
it back.  I have tried the resulting arc520.com, and it seems to work.
