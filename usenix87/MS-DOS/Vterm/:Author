[  This package provides duplicate functionality for Unix and PC
   screen-oriented programs.  (Is that sentence in English?)
   A Makefile doesn't make sense, and I guess I'm being nice by
   not sticking to my requirement for a manpage.  Comments on that,
   anyone?  I have not done anything to or with these programs, other
   than to re-shar them.  -r$  ]

As the README file mentions, there is little documentation and no
test program.  Adding all the stuff to make it into a "neat" posting
would cost me a day or two, which I simply can't spare.  I believe that
it is useful enough in its current state.
