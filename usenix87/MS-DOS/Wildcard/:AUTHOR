Summary: expand your argv and amaze your friends

Since Microsoft has left us some nice BDOS hooks for looking up filenames
with wildcards in them, we may as well take advantage of them.  For those
of you writing UNIX-like hacks with expandable filenames using Lattice C
(am I the only one here?), here's how to expand them.  Use the call

	n = directory(filespec, namelist)

where filespec is the pattern you want to match (possibly including
drive name, slashes or backslashes, asterisks and question marks).
Namelist is a char ***: pass it the address of the char** that you
want to end up pointing to the list of names.  It allocates space for
the name with getmem.  It returns the number of files found matching
the description.
