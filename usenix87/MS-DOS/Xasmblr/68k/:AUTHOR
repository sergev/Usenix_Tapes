Okay, folks, here it is:  The great and glorious (:-)) 68000 cross-assembler.
Its written in Vanilla basic and will run straight on an IBM (although it
will look a wee bit strange).  

Some notes:  This is only the first pass of the assembler.  People working
on writing the second pass should mail me and I'll make vague passes at 
coordinating the effort.  You'll also need a 68000 maunal with the bit
patterns for the opcodes if you're going to write the second pass.
Also, the screen control codes (originally written for a C64) need to
be filled in.  Right now, they are in print statements as "<bs>" and other
similar symbols.  There is also one Locate which will need to be changed if
you plan to port the program top a non-IBM machine.
About the "\" character:  This is used by the display routines and is a
special character which ends a display command.  A display command is started
with an @ sign.  Be careful with both of these characters.  BTW, I would
suggest that both of them be changed to something which is unprintable.
However, do this after downloading the program.  Kermit at the very least
won't like whatever characters you substitute.  TI$ is a system variable
which should be changed to your machines real time clock -- on some machines
this is time$.  If you have any problems, mail me and I'll try to explain
the twisted internal logic which the program is based on.

This is an ascii file.  It should be saved and this header lopped off.  It
can then be ported to your micro, or you can do the header lopping on the
micro if you have EDLIN or some reasonable facsimile.
