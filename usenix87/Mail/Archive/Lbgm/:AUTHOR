Due to forces beyond my control, the automatic archive recovery
system is closed as of today.

All further requests made into this system will be responded to
with a simple message:
	"this system is closed"

I am sorry for this inconvience.

HOWEVER -- I am now going to distribute the sources.
(I wish I could send them to mod.sources, but I won't be around long
enough to verify posting there ... Sorry John.)
