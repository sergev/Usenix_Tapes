To install:
	READ the COMMAND-DESC file, which explains the commands
	and the cavaets for SYSV and its variants.

	edit the makefile, changing the definitions at the head
	of the file to fit your needs.

	run the makefile (make all)

	examine the resulting sources for verification of the
	paths requested.

	make install

	this should install the programs where they live.
	
	install the sources you currently have using the following
	or some variation thereof...

	    find net/sources mod/sources -type f -print > list-to-archive
	    while read filename
	    do
		${progdir}/savesource < ${filename}
	    done < list-to-archive
	
	that should do it...
