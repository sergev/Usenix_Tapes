Sick of all those junky header lines and second-hand
quotations in your saved articles and mail?
I've been using this shell script to clean them up
automatically by deleting lines that match certain patterns.
You may customize it to suit.  BTW, a pattern starting
with '^' is anchored to the beginning of the line,
for those of you who don't remember good ole "ed."

To use, just say "cleanup <filename>".
