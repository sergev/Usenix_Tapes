The following is a script to track and mail to ADMIN the
clean up of the sendmail queue.  This clears invalid files,
moves out the wedged mail and sends a report to the administrator
listed in ADMIN.

I have been using it for about 3 months without problems, and It
lets me know how well the local area network moves its mail.

I install it as /usr/adm/clr.queue, and have cron run it once
a nite at about 2am.  (low active user count).
