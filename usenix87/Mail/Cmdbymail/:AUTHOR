Did you ever want to get that file you forgot to take with you when you
went to visit that other university? What a shame  you forgot!  Now you
will not be able to get it fast.

But with 'cmdbymail', you can just send yourself a command file to mail
the missing file to you at the place you are currently at, and the mail
system will take care of it. How is it done? Unpack this shell archive,
by feeding everything below the dashed line to 'sh',  and read  the man
page included.
