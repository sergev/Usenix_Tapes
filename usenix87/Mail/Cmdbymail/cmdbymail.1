..SH NAME
cmdbymail \- execute commands by mail
..SH SYNOPSYS
..B cmdbymail

..SH DESCRIPTION
..I Cmdbymail
allows a user to execute commands by mail when the user is away.
This is intended to be used as an inexpensive dummy server, or as
a way for a user to execute commands on systems where he has accounts
but cannot log in from his present location.
For example, an ARPA user who has an account on a
machine on the UUCP network can execute
commands on the UUCP machine even though he cannot log in on it directly.
..PP
..I Cmdbymail
must be run once by the user before he leaves the system on which the
commands should be executed.
When it is run by the user, it prompts for three parameters.
It asks for a full path to the user that
will be allowed to execute commands via mail.
..I Cmdbymail
also asks for a subject line to identify messages containing commands to
execute.
Lastly, it asks for a file to save all mail in.
..PP
..I Cmdbymail
creates a .forward file in the user's home directory which will execute
..I cmdbymail
for each mail message received.
If the message is sent by the trusted user who is allowed to execute remote
commands, and the subject line identifies this as a command message, the
body of the message will be executed as a shell procedure, with \"sh\".
..I All
messages, whether they are command messages or not, are saved into the
saved mail file, for later perusal.
..SH FILES
~/.forward - used to store the name of the trusted user and the subject line
for command messages.
..br
The mail save file is named by the user as the third parameter for
..I cmdbymail.
..SH BUGS
If the commands in a command message fail, no output is returned to the
sender.
..PP
It is currently impossible to set up servers for a group of users or all
users.
..PP
It is ridiculously easy to cause security problems with this program.
No more hints given here..
