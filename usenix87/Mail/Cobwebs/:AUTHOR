Here is a program which reports unusually large, or unusually
old, mailboxes in /usr/spool/mail.  

When the user file system is under disc quota, the mail system
can often be used as "secondary" storage.  This program points
out users with unusually large amounts of unread mail.

The program will report for specific usernames, and sort either
alphabetically, by mailbox size, or mailbox age.  A quiet option
supresses the top banner.
