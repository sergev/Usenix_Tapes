	Sorry, it would seem that a couple problems cropped up.  I will just
repost the entire thing... this time, I also have the MAN page.  problems
that occured:

		Make had a problem with spaces in-front of shell commands
		some 4.2 systems don't have <fcntl.h>
		some files were not tabbed correctly (dmail.help)

	Please bear with me.... after all, this is the first time I've posted
something to thils net.

	I've split the program up into Three sections.  Don't combine these
files with files from the first posting, just redo it with these.

			Thanks,

			-Matt
