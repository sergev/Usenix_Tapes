README FILE FOR DMAIL v1.00

Read Makefile for compiling and installation procedures. 
    
Dmail compiles fine on UNIX BSD 4.2/4.3.  A man page is coming soon,
though every command as a full help page (online from Dmail).

AN EXAMPLE OF A .DMAILRC FILE: (happens to be mine)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
alias normal    "setlist -s 18 From 38 Subject 10 To 0 Cc 0 Date"
alias from      "setlist -s 66 From; list; normal"
alias me        "select To dillon , Cc dillon"
alias bugs      "select To root staff manag , Cc staff manag root"
alias trek      "select To trek , Cc trek"
alias notme     "select -s To !dillon; resel -s Cc !dillon; resel From !dillon"
alias hack      "select To hacker , Cc hacker"
alias page      set page more
alias nopage    unset page
alias k         tag
alias kn        "tag ; next"
alias spool     "g /usr/spool/mail/dillon ~/Dmail/mbox"
alias keep      "g ~/Dmail/keep"
alias mbox      "g ~/Dmail/mbox"
alias q         "select -s all; write ~/Dmail/keep -s tag; delete -s tag; quit"
alias g         "select -s all; write ~/Dmail/keep -s tag; delete -s tag; qswi"
set amiga       "decwrl!pyramid!amiga!support"
set header      ~/.mailheader
set ask
normal
cd ~/Dmail
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

In the above example, I have created a Dmail directory to hold all my
folders.  Each folder will be a file containing multiple messages, fully
compatible with /usr/spool/ and mbox.

my dmail alias is this:
alias dmail '\dmail -O -l ~/Dmail/.dmailrc -o ~/Dmail/mbox -F Cc -F Date'

NOTE: you don't need to alias dmail to anything.  without any arguments,
it acts like /bin/Mail getting your mail from your spool, and placing 
read mail on quit to mbox in your home directory.  I use -O so dmail
gives me a command prompt even if there is no mail, and the -F options
tell dmail to load those subjects into memory automatically (because I'm
going to select on them immediately anyway).  If a field which you select
on is not in memory, dmail must go to the mail file to find the field.
This is transparent.

GOOD LUCK!

                    -Matt
