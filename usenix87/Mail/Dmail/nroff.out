NAME
     dmail - an original mail like interface for mail

SYNOPSIS
     dmail -v -O -f [fromfile] -o [tofile] -l rcfile -L -F
     [field] -F [field]...

     dmail user user user user...

GENERAL
     _D_m_a_i_l is a program which hopefully simplifies reading and
     organizing your mail.  It was designed to overcome several
     gripes people had over other mailers.  _D_m_a_i_l uses the
     /usr/spool format for any folder's you create.  To simply
     matters even more, it was partially modeled on standard Mail
     in terms of writing to your 'mbox' and getting items from
     your 'spool', at least as default parameters.  About the
     only other similarity between the two programs is in the
     'type', 'quit', and 'exit' commands of _d_m_a_i_l.  _D_m_a_i_l _k_e_e_p_s
     _m_u_l_t_i_p_l_e _m_e_s_s_a_g_e_s _p_e_r _f_i_l_e, mail (thus folders are files
     rather than directories).

     _D_m_a_i_l is not a glorified _M_a_i_l, however.  Though most other
     mailers have folders, you are usually required to read your
     mail in the order it comes in.  For somebody who is on three
     high-volume mailing lists, it can be rather difficult. _D_m_a_i_l
     provides a mechanism in which you can separate your mail by
     any partial string in any Field without having to create a
     folder.  The _s_e_l_e_c_t command is usually instantanious, and
     with aliases, you can switch between mailing lists, personal
     mail, or anything you wish at a keystroke.  Whenever you
     _s_e_l_e_c_t on something, you get a reduced list (as if the other
     messages didn't exist), and may execute such things as
     'delete all' on it without effecting other mail.  It serves
     to allow you to read each mailing list (or whatever) one at
     a time.

     Mail-headers are a problem for many people, especially those
     logging in over 300 or 1200 baud lines.  In many cases, the
     header is larger than the message; in any case, they can be
     a nuisances.  _D_m_a_i_l will not print any fields you do not
     want printed.  This seems to be a better mechanism than
     Mail, which allows you to exclude certain headers.  In
     _d_m_a_i_l, you specify what to include.  To see the entire
     header, you use the _h_e_a_d_e_r command from _d_m_a_i_l.

     Apart from that, _d_m_a_i_l gives you set variables, aliases,
     folder's, and is generally faster than other mail programs.

OPTIONS
     _D_m_a_i_l may be executed with several options, putting it in
     one of two modes.  Firstly, when executed with a user-name

     list, _d_m_a_i_l will put you into the editor setting up the To:
     field properly and allowing you to enter a letter which
     would then be sent off.  Secondly, if no user-list is given,
     dmail will attempt to read mail from your spool file (or
     from file), and put you into command mode.  If the mail file
     is empty or does not exist, you will be told that you have
     no mail, and control will be returned to your shell.  The
     editor is specified by the enviroment variable VISUAL
     (Default vi).

     dmail -O -v -f [fromfile] -o [tofile] -l rcfile -L -F
     [field] -F [field]...

     -O   places _d_m_a_i_l in interactive mode, even if there is no
          mail to read.

     -v   Places sendmail in verbose mode when you mail, reply,
          or forward a message. (sets the verbose variable)

     -f   Specify where mail should be taken from.  The default
          is /usr/spool/mail/$USER.  This option without a
          filename specifies that mail should be taken from
          $HOME/mbox.  Otherwise, the specified filename becomes
          the fromfile.  This means that by specifying just the
          -f option and not the -o option will cause both the
          infile and outfile to be $HOME/mbox

     -o   Specify where 'read' mail will be written out to.  The
          default is $HOME/mbox.  This option without a filename
          specifies that the mail should be placed in $HOME/.mbox
          .  Otherwise, the specified filename becomes the out-
          file.  Additionally, if both -f and -o are specified
          without filenames, both the fromfile and the outfile
          will be set to $HOME/.mbox

     -l   Specify the RC file (default is $HOME/.dmailrc).  The
          RC file consists of a list of _d_m_a_i_l commands, as if
          they were typed in.

     -L   Disables sourcing of any RC files

     -F   This option tells _d_m_a_i_l to include the given field on
          initial mail load.  Normally, only the From:, To:, and
          Subject: fields are initially loaded.  When you specify
          other fields, _d_m_a_i_l must scan your fromfile again.
          When you have large amounts of mail (+50000 bytes),
          this can take a couple of seconds.  The -F option
          allows you to specify a field to be loaded in addition
          to the defaults listed above.  You may specify multiple
          -F field  options.  This is only a convenience feature,
          normally you don't have to worry about it.  Some peo-
          ple, however, have spool files of several hundred

          thousand bytes and would use this option to prevent
          delays later on.

INTERRUPTS
     _d_m_a_i_l handles the INTR character.  You may use it to break
     out of listings, types, or anything else without worry of
     destroying something.

COMMAND OVERVIEW
     The basic commands for _d_m_a_i_l are as follows (There are, of
     course, many commands, these are just a few): _l_i_s_t _t_y_p_e
     _h_e_a_d_e_r _d_e_l_e_t_e _n_e_x_t _s_e_l_e_c_t _q_u_i_t _e_x_i_t _a_l_i_a_s _u_n_a_l_i_a_s _s_e_t _u_n_s_e_t
     and _m_a_i_l

     You may abbrieviate any command you wish.  It is suggested
     that you do not abbreviate commands in your rc file (default
     .dmailrc), as any new commands added in later versions may
     change something. Using full command names in your rc file
     will keep things compatible.

     For many commands (e.g. delete), you may specify a message
     list.  You can give numerical ranges (1-4 6-9), number lists
     (1 2 3 6), or any of several reserved words, such as 'all'.
     See 'help keywords' from dmail for a complete list.  All
     lists apply only to the currently selected messages.

     _l_i_s_t displays parts of the headers of messages, one message
     per line, for all messages currently selected.  You can set
     the output format with the _s_e_t_l_i_s_t command.

     _t_y_p_e prints the message text of a message.  By the way, only
     header fields specified by the _s_e_t_l_i_s_t command will be
     printed (default- From: To: Subject:), which is useful.

     _h_e_a_d_e_r prints out the entire header of a message.

     _d_e_l_e_t_e deletes a message or message list (you can say
     'delete all' to delete all messages currently selected).

     _n_e_x_t goes to the next message and type's or header's it,
     depending on what last was done (type or header).

     _s_e_l_e_c_t selects what you want to look at.  You can say
     'select all', to select all the messages, or selects of the
     form:

     select Field match match match , Field match match ....

     where Field is From:, To:, or any field you wish (you can
     abbreviate the fields.... Fro To, etc...).  match is a
     string which you are attempting to match in the Field.  If a
     match is found, that message will become selected.  Thus,

     you can select all your personal mail with:

     select Cc myname , To myname

     Use the on-line help for more information on the _s_e_l_e_c_t or
     any other command.

     _q_u_i_t from _d_m_a_i_l please.  Any unread messages stay in your
     spool (or fromfile), any read messages are placed in your
     mail-box, any deleted messages are deleted.

     _e_x_i_t from _d_m_a_i_l please.  Nothing is written or altered, exit
     without changing anything.  _a_l_i_a_s is used to alias commands
     to other commands, or command sequences.  For instance, you
     can alias 'me' to select all personal mail:

     alias me "select Cc myname , To myname"

     you can alias a sequence of commands:

     alias q  "select all ; pre all ; quit"

     The above would unread any read mail and quit (therefore,
     any mail not deleted will end up staying in your spool
     file).  You can also _u_n_a_l_i_a_s aliases.

     _s_e_t a variable to a string.  You can also _u_n_s_e_t a variable.
     Several variables have special meaning, use _h_e_l_p _s_e_t from
     _d_m_a_i_l for a full explanation.

     _m_a_i_l and _r_e_p_l_y may be used to mail out or reply to messages.
