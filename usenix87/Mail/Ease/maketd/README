Maketd is a local program a Purdue University Computing Center that
updates make(1) specification files.  There are two versions of maketd
in this directory.  One is a slow shell version that should work almost
anywhere, the other is a faster C version with more featurtes that may
take some time to bring up.

Choose either to update the makefiles in the ease source, or do it by hand.
