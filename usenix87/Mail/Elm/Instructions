			Last Update: July 17th, 1986


	This file contains instructions on how to create and install
the entire ELM mail system.  It should be read BEFORE any attempts
are made at actually creating and/or installing any of the software
contained herein!

	There is actually really one step needed - unpack all the shar
files and then;

	$ cd <where-ever you're keeping the Elm sources>

	$ sh Configure.sh

	Answer the questions of that program,, then let it create the localized
Makefiles and system definition files for you.  When it's done you can double
check the configuration (or customize it further) by reading the Configuration
Guide + editing the file "hdrs/sysdefs.h".  There are lots of neat features
that are unique to this mailer - it's worth a quick perusal at least!

	Once you're happy with the localized files, you then need to create
the documentation (so there's a bit of a catch-22 that you need to format the
Configuration guide before you are happy with the localization but can't do
that until you're happy with the localization...oh well).

	$

	$ make documentation

    When that's done, or even if it fails (don't worry too much about it)

	$ (make -i all >& MAKELOG) &
	$ tail -f MAKELOG

    (if you're in "sh", you can use "> MAKELOG 2>&1" instead of ">& MAKELOG")

This will take a fair while, so it's recommended that you go and eat 
lunch or play a game for a while!! (alternatively, spend lots of money
on a really FAST machine and blink your eyes a few times...)

Assuming there are no errors during compilation (we'll have to assume
that for the moment) you should now be able to list the directory "bin"
and find the following files:

    "answer", "arepdaemon", "autoreply", "fastmail", "from", 
    "elm", "newalias", "newmail", "printmail", and "readmsg".

next, you can install all the software on your system by;

	$ make -i install
	
Note: the mailer runs as setgid mail to have the ability to WRITE
to the /usr/mail directory (for lock files).   If you have a different
scheme at your site, feel free to set it up to use that instead.

Finally, we're just about done!   The final checks can be made
by the following commands:

	$ /usr/local/bin/elm -z

should say "no mail" if nothing's in your incoming mailbox, and

	$ /usr/local/bin/elm -f test/test.mail

should read in EIGHT messages from various people.  While here, try to
A)lias C)urrent message for each of the eight messages to confirm that
the reply/address system is working okay.   Now try to C)hange mailboxes
to the file "test/test.note" and use the '%' key to see if the mailer is
generating valid return addresses for the notes (If not, then you might
need to install the pathalias database - see "sysdefs.h" for more info)
Change back to "test/test.mail" and Q)uit without having marked anything 
for deletion...answer the questions accordingly.

If you get this far you're in Wonderful shape!  In fact, you're done!

Congratulations!  You've just installed one of the best electronic mail
systems available today on your machine (if I say so myself!)

HANDY HINTS:  If you want to create a print of the entire set of
sources, including this file, use the command:

	$ make listing

If, on the other hand, you just want to create a listing file of 
just the ELM sources, try:

	$ make elm-listing

Also, if you have a number of machines on a network, you can rlogin
to the remote machine and then do a remote install (after checking
to ensure that the networking copy method in the Makefile under the
target "remote-install" is correct) by typing:

	$ make -f <remote Makefile> REMOTE=<remote file system> rmt-install

(for example, if we had installed the system on machine "machx" and 
 wanted to install it on "machy", with the Makefile in /src/Elm on
 "machx", we could type from "machy";
	 $ make -f machx:/src/Elm/Makefile REMOTE=machx: rmt-install
 to have it install the system on machine y!)

One final note for non-US distribution - the program might complain
at link time that it can't find "crypt()".  If so, and if you cannot
obtain a copy, you should merely instruct your users to not use the
encrypted mail option on outgoing mail.

That's it!

Oh!  One final note: if you'd like a nicely typeset copy of the documentation,
feel free to drop me a line with your full (overland) mail address!!  I'll
try to get it back to you within a week or two.
