			  	COPYING POLICIES

     Permission is hereby granted for copying and distribution of copies of
  the Elm source files, and that of any part thereof, subject to the following 
  license conditions:

        1. You may without additional permission from the author, distribute 
           Elm or components of Elm, with or without additions developed by 
           you or by others at no charge.  You may also distribute Elm along 
           with any other product for sale, provided that the cost of the 
           bundled package is the same regardless of whether Elm is included,
           and provided that those interested only in Elm must be notified 
           that it is product freely available from the author.

        2. Furthermore, if you distribute Elm software or parts of Elm, with 
           or without additions developed by you or others, then you must 
           either make available source of all portions of the Elm program 
           (exclusive of any additions made by you or by others) upon request, 
           or instead you may notify anyone requesting source that it is 
           freely available from the author.

        3. In addition, you may not omit any of the copyright notices
           on either the source files, the executable file, or the 
           documentation, and

        4. Also, you may not omit transmission of this License agreement with 
           whatever portions of Elm that are distributed.

        5. Lastly, any users of this software must be notified that it is any 
           without warrantee, or guarantee of any nature, express or implied, 
           nor is there any fitness for use represented.

Software is a malleable thing - especially Unix - and the author can in no
way guarantee that using this program will not cause grevious damage to your
system.  Of course this isn't anticipated, but if it does happen, the author
cannot be held liable for any damages either directly or indirectly caused
by this event.

Modification of the system is encouraged, providing that the portions of 
the system that are from the original still carry the appropriate copyright
notices and that the changed sections are clearly delimited as such.  The
author requests copies of any changes made to ensure that the various versions
stay reasonably in sync with each other.

NOTE that it is not permitted to copy, sublicense distribute or transfer any
of the Elm software except as expressly indicated herein.  Any attempts to
do otherwise will be considered a violation of this license and your rights
to the Elm software will be voided.


Comments on the system and/or this licensing agreement is encouraged.  Send
electronic mail to "taylor@hplabs.HP.COM".  This license was written with
help from Scott McGregor.  Thanks Scott!
