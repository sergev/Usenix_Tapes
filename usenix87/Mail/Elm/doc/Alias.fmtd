               This document is intended as a supplement to the _E_l_m
       _U_s_e_r_s  _G_u_i_d_e and is only of interest to those users desiring
       more knowledge about how aliases  work  and  how  to  create
       strange  and exciting aliases for their systems (alright, so
       it's not _t_h_a_t exciting!)


               This document is broken up into the  following  sec-
       tions;  user aliases, group aliases, system aliases, editing
       and installing new aliases, the  machine  routing  database,
       the  domain routing database, and general warnings and other
       chitchat.



       1.  UUUUsssseeeerrrr AAAAlllliiiiaaaasssseeeessss

               The most simple sort of aliases in  the  EEEEllllmmmm  system
       are  individual  user  aliases.   These are made up of three
       parts;

               _a_l_i_a_s_n_a_m_e _l_i_s_t : _u_s_e_r_n_a_m_e : _a_d_d_r_e_s_s

       Where the _a_l_i_a_s_n_a_m_e _l_i_s_t is either a single aliasname819 or  a


       __________

        1. Please see the appendix for a full definition of what
           exactly an aliasname consists of.




                                  Page 1







       Alias Users Guide                                version 1.5



       list of aliasnames separated by commas.

               _U_s_e_r_n_a_m_e is used to indicate the full "real name" of
       the  user. For example, if you had an alias for "dat" to get
       to me, the _u_s_e_r_n_a_m_e field would  contain  "Dave  Taylor"  or
       perhaps "Dave Taylor at HP" or some other permutation.  Ver-
       sions 1.2a and later of the EEEEllllmmmm system use this  information
       to  add to the addresses of outbound mail in the interest of
       more readable addresses.  It is recommended that this  field
       contain peoples names only.

               _A_d_d_r_e_s_s is either the  users  full  electronic  mail
       address  or,  if  the machine routing database is installed,
       the minimum address needed to specify the destination.   For
       example,  say  our routing database contained information on
       how to get to machine "hp-sdd"  and  I  wanted  to  have  an
       address  for  my friend Ken there - I could have his address
       specified as  simply  "ken@hp-sdd"  (or  alternatively  "hp-
       sdd!ken" since the two are functionally equivalent).


       Let's get on to some examples, shall we?

       Consider this excerpt from my own ._a_l_i_a_s__t_e_x_t file;

       wunder,walter : Walter Underwood: wunder@hpcea
       laubach       : Mark Laubach    : laubach@hpcea
       mary          : Mary Hsia-Coron : hsia@hpindla
       decot         : Dave Decot      : decot@hpda

       jeff          : Jeff Wu         : hpcnoe!j_wu
       dave          : Dave Barrett    : hpcnof!d_barrett

       Note that the alias for Walter Underwood has two  _a_l_i_a_s_n_a_m_e_s
       associated  with  it, _w_u_n_d_e_r and _w_a_l_t_e_r_f_R.  _A_l_s_o _n_o_t_i_c_e _t_h_a_t
       _t_h_e _f_i_r_s_t _f_o_u_r _a_l_i_a_s_e_s _u_s_e _t_h_e _I_n_t_e_r_n_e_t _s_t_y_l_e _n_a_m_i_n_g _c_o_n_v_e_n_-
       _t_i_o_n (_u_s_e_r@_m_a_c_h_i_n_e) but the last two use the UUCP style con-
       vention (_m_a_c_h_i_n_e!_u_s_e_r).  In this context it is independent.

               The only time when it _d_o_e_s make a  difference  which
       notation  you  use  is  if you have to specify more than the
       machine that the user is receiving mail on.  That is, say we
       have  a friend who receives mail at a machine called ttttwwwwiiiinnnnkkkkiiiieeee
       and our best connection  is  through  Georgia  Institute  of
       Technology (``gatech'')...Our alias for them could be;

         buddy         : Our friend      : gatech!twinkie!buddy

       or

         buddy2        : Our friend      : gatech!buddy@twinkie



                                  Page 2







       Alias Users Guide                                version 1.5



       but not;

         buddy         : Our friend      : buddy@twinkie@gatech

       (however, buddy%twinkie@gatech _w_i_l_l also  work,  but  that's
       far  too  bizarre  a  notation to be recommended!!) (besides
       there's no guarantee that "gatech" will  like  it,  nor  the
       "buddy2" alias above!)

               Anyway, suffice to say that if you must specify  any
       sort  of route that you should use the uucp notation as much
       as possible to ensure that the system  expands  the  correct
       machine name.



       2.  GGGGrrrroooouuuupppp AAAAlllliiiiaaaasssseeeessss

               After the confusion of user aliases,  group  aliases
       are  even  more fun!  For the most part the notation is very
       similar;

               _a_l_i_a_s_n_a_m_e _l_i_s_t : _g_r_o_u_p_n_a_m_e : _l_i_s_t _o_f _p_e_o_p_l_e

       Where _a_l_i_a_s_n_a_m_e _l_i_s_t and _g_r_o_u_p_n_a_m_e are exactly equivalent to
       the corresponding fields in user aliases.

               The interesting part is the _l_i_s_t  _o_f  _p_e_o_p_l_e  field!
       This field is actually in the same notation as the aliasname
       list, so it's not quite as  strange  as  I've  lead  you  to
       believe.  It's best to illustrate by example;

       friends, mypals, gang : The Gang of Six : joe, larry, mary, joanna,
                                                 nancy, michael

       (Notice that you can continue onto as many  lines  as  you'd
       like  so  long  as  each additional line start with either a
       SPACE or a TAB character)

               The significant limitation  with  group  aliases  is
       that  each  of  the  people in the list must be a _p_r_e_v_i_o_u_s_l_y
       _d_e_f_i_n_e_d _a_l_i_a_s_n_a_m_e _i_n _e_i_t_h_e_r _t_h_e _e_x_i_s_t_i_n_g _a_l_i_a_s _f_i_l_e  _o_r  _t_h_e
       _s_y_s_t_e_m  _a_l_i_a_s  _f_i_l_e  or  a  valid destination on the current
       machine.

               What does this mean?  This means that the  following
       excerpt from an alias file;

       hawaii : The Hawaiian Twins : joe@RIT-CS.ARPA, maoa
       maoa   : Maoa Lichtenski Jr : maoa@Hawaii.cs.uh.ARPA




                                  Page 3







       Alias Users Guide                                version 1.5



       will fail for two reasons - not only does the group _l_i_s_t  _o_f
       _p_e_o_p_l_e  contain  a  complex address, but it also contains an
       aliasname that is defined _l_a_t_e_r in the ._a_l_i_a_s__t_e_x_t file!  ********
       BBBBEEEEWWWWAAAARRRREEEE!!!!!!!!!!!! ********

               The correct way to have the previous  alias  in  the
       file is to have it like;

       joe    : Joe Lichtenski     : joe@RIT-CS
       maoa   : Maoa Lichtenski Jr : maoa@Hawaii
       hawaii : The Hawaiian Twins : joe, maoa

       which will then work correctly.

       This isn't too hard now, is it?

       Fortunately, while this seems pretty  tough,  when  you  run
       _n_e_w_a_l_i_a_s  to  install  the  new  aliases,  it  will give you
       relevent and meaningful error messages that  will  help  you
       fix the list up correctly!



       3.  SSSSyyyysssstttteeeemmmm AAAAlllliiiiaaaasssseeeessss

               System aliases are functionally  equivalent  to  the
       individual  EEEEllllmmmm  alias  lists  each  EEEEllllmmmm user has (both user
       aliases and group aliases) but are "read only" for  everyone
       but the EEEEllllmmmm administrator.  The format of the file is ident-
       ical to the users file, and the only difference is that this
       file  is  expected  to be located in the directory that con-
       tains the _s_y_s_t_e_m__h_a_s_h__f_i_l_e and _s_y_s_t_e_m__d_a_t_a__f_i_l_e  files  (see
       the  _E_l_m _C_o_n_f_i_g_u_r_a_t_i_o_n _G_u_i_d_e for more details on these vari-
       ables).

               Simply create a ._a_l_i_a_s__t_e_x_t  file  in  the  specific
       directory  as  you  would  a normal file, and install it the
       same way (see the following  section  for  more  details  on
       that).

               Voila!!

               To install new aliases, you need merely  to  create,
       or  modify,  your  ._a_l_i_a_s__t_e_x_t  file  in your home directory
       until you're satisfied with it and it meets the requirements
       stated  above.  You can then try to install it with the com-
       mand;



                                  Page 4







       Alias Users Guide                                version 1.5



               $ nnnneeeewwwwaaaalllliiiiaaaassss

       which  will  either  report  back  the  number  of   aliases
       installed  into  the system or will report errors indicative
       of the changes that the program expects before it can accept
       the alias list.

               Note that blank lines are no problem and  that  com-
       ments are not only allowed but actually encouraged, and must
       have `####' as the first character of each comment line.

       Finally, if you find that  you're  hitting  the  ``Too  many
       aliases''  error, then you'll need to reconfigure the entire
       EEEEllllmmmm system (again, see the _E_l_m _C_o_n_f_i_g_u_r_a_t_i_o_n _G_u_i_d_e).

               Floating about on the various networks is  a  rather
       nifty  program by a number of people, including Peter Honey-
       man and Steve Bellovin, called _p_a_t_h_a_l_i_a_s.  What this incred-
       ibly handy program does is take the strange postings in net-
       news groups like "news.map" and massage them into a file  of
       the form;

         _h_o_s_t_n_a_m_e    <tab>    _a_d_d_r_e_s_s

       which is then sorted alphabetically and stored in  the  file
       pointed  to by _p_a_t_h_f_i_l_e (guess where to look for more infor-
       mation!) for EEEEllllmmmm to use.

               If you don't have the program, or don't want to  use
       it,  you  can  simulate this file by listing machines in the
       same format.  The exact format expected is;

         _h_o_s_t_n_a_m_e<tab>_m_a_c_h_i_n_e-_a_d_d_r_e_s_s

       where _h_o_s_t_n_a_m_e is a limited identifier (no  special  charac-
       ters)  and  machine-address  MUST  contain the sequence `%s'
       (and consequently any other percent signs that appear in the
       address  must  be  paired)  so  that the call in the program
       ``sprintf(buffer, machine-address, username)'' will generate
       a valid return address.

       By way of example, here are a few entries from my own file;

        HPL    hplabs!%s
        PARC   hplabs!%s@Xerox.PA.COM
        amc-hq     hplabs!%s@AMC-HQ.ARPA
        imsss      hplabs!%s%%IMSSS@SU-AI.ARPA

        interleaf  hpfcdc!hpda!sun!interleaf!%s
        jpl-vax    hplabs!%s@jpl-vax

       As you can see, the addresses can get  pretty  complicated!!
       In  fact it's due purely to the complication that a database
       file of this sort can be so wonderful!!

       If you'd like further information on the pathalias  program,
       try  keeping  track  of  the  entries  in  the netnews group
       _m_o_d._s_o_u_r_c_e_s - it's posted about once a year or so...

               One of the more interesting features of the 3.2  and
       above  EEEEllllmmmm  mailer  is the domain routing database.  This is
       the same database (in the same strange format)  as  used  by
       the most recent version of the _u_u_m_a_i_l program.

               In a nutshell, the file contains information of  the
       form;

       The _d_o_m_a_i_n field must begin with a leading `.' and should be
       ordered in the same notation as the standard domain informa-
       tion (that is, ".HP.COM" not ".COM.HP").

               _P_a_t_h_t_o_g_a_t_e_w_a_y is routing information on how  to  get
       to  the  particular  gateway  that  this domain expects, and
       always is a machine/host name (to be found in the  pathalias
       database, see the previous section) preceeded by a `>' char-
       acter.

               _R_e_w_r_i_t_e-_t_e_m_p_l_a_t_e is  the  most  interesting  of  the
       three,  and  is  akin to a printf string for C.  The changes
       are that instead of `%s' `%d' and so on,  the  actual  "per-
       cent" values represent various parts of the address, namely;

               Symbol          Represents
               ------          ----------
                 %U            The username in the To: address
                 %N            The remote machine name
                 %D            %N + domain information
                 %R            path to %N from pathalias
                 %P            _p_a_t_h_t_o_g_a_t_e_w_a_y entry
                 %S            Obsolete!
                 %%            The `%' character

       with this very intuitive setup, let's look at a few  entries
       from the domains database and see how they work;

         .EUR.UUCP,,,%R!%U
         .ATT.UUCP,>ihnp4,,%P!%D!%U
         .HP.COM,,,%R!%U
         .UUCP,,,%R!%U
         .COM,>hplabs,,%P!%U@%D
         .CSNET,>hplabs,,%P!%U%%%D@CSNET-RELAY.ARPA
         .ARPA,>hplabs,,%P!%U@%D

       (Note the presence of a third field  that  is  always  null.
       This  is  for  compatability  with the "uumail" program, but
       this field is now always _N_U_L_L)

               To see how it all works, let's suppose that we  want
       to  send  a  message to "jad@Purdue.ARPA".  This would break
       down into the following fields:

               %U = jad
               %N = Purdue
               %D = Purdue.ARPA

       When the eeeellllmmmm program matches the ".ARPA" entry

         .ARPA,>hplabs,,%P!%U@%D

       the other fields instantiated would be:

               %P = <path to hplabs>
         template = %P!%U@%D

       As  is  hopefully  obvious,  if  our  path  to  hplabs   was
       "hpcnoe!hplabs" then the fully expanded address would be;

               hpcnoe!hplabs!jad@Purdue.ARPA

       And so on.


               What does this mean to the average user?   It  means
       that  you  can for the most part send mail to people on dif-
       ferent gateways by simply using their full  domain  informa-
       tion, so that mail to addresses like "Jack@MIT.MIT.EDU" will
       work, and mail to "SueAnn@BBN.MAILNET" will work and so on!!

               Probably the biggest question you have in your  mind
       right  now is "But how the heck does this relate to the 'ole
       _B_e_r_k_e_l_e_y _M_a_i_l aliases and the  snazzo  _s_e_n_d_m_a_i_l  alias  sys-
       tem??"   Well,  rest  assured,  _s_e_n_d_m_a_i_l  fans,  that if you
       _r_e_a_l_l_y want to have your aliases down in the  transport  you
       can.   No problem.  All you'll need to do is to turn off the
       address validation routine in EEEEllllmmmm (I'm  not  even  going  to
       bother to tell you where to look for this one!!).

               For those _B_e_r_k_e_l_e_y _M_a_i_l fanatics out there, you  can
       translate  your  aliases  into  the format that EEEEllllmmmm wants by
       running them through the _a_w_k script listed in Appendix Two.


               Finally, if you have any problems or questions,  try
       looking  in the _n_e_w_a_l_i_a_s manual entry, or dropping me a line
       at the "usual" email address (ask your administrator!).
