               This document is intended as a supplement to the _E_l_m
       _U_s_e_r_s  _G_u_i_d_e  and  is  only of interest to those people at a
       site either installing or maintaining the source code to the
       EEEEllllmmmm mail system.



               It's _h_i_g_h_l_y recommended that installation be done by
       using  the  _C_o_n_f_i_g_u_r_e._s_h  script  supplied  with the system.
       Please see the file _I_n_s_t_r_u_c_t_i_o_n_s for further information.


       The remainder of this  document  will  discuss  the  options
       available  via  direct  editing of various files and parame-
       ters.  As indicated above, 99.9% of the sites  that  install
       EEEEllllmmmm should find the _C_o_n_f_i_g_u_r_e._s_h script sufficient.



               The first thing that needs to be decided when you're
       ready  to install the program is what sort of operating sys-
       tem you're running on...  currently the choices are;

          System V   This is the default configuration, and  should
                     work  on  all  Bell  System  V  Unix  systems,

                                  Page 1







       Elm Configuration Guide                          version 1.5



                     including HP-UX (and the _S_p_e_c_t_r_u_m series!)  or
                     simulations thereof.

          BSD        This is for the Berkeley breed of Unix.

          UTS        This is for the Amdahl version of Unix.

          SUN        This is for the Sun workstations  (This  is  a
                     superset  of  the  BSD  definition  as the Sun
                     appears to have some major crises when  it  is
                     asked  to  perform string functions and handed
                     _n_u_l_l addresses, as opposed to a _p_o_i_n_t_e_r  to  a
                     _n_u_l_l...)

          PYRAMID    This is for the Pyramid 90x machines (This  is
                     the same as the BSD definition)

       Once you've decided which is appropriate, edit the  Makefile
       file in the top level directory and alter the "DEFINE" there
       (about line 33 or so)  accordingly.   (Note:  also  use  the
       associated  "LIB2" define that's associated with each of the
       systems  to  ensure  that  the  program  uses  the   correct
       libraries when linking together!)

       An analogous change should be made in the Makefile in  'src'
       and  'utils'  too  if you're planning on actually working on
       the programs rather than just installing them...

       While you're at it, if you happen to be running _A_C_S_N_E_T, then
       you need to add the relevent define in the main Makefile and
       the Makefile in directory `src' too!


       Once that's done, all of the  other  installation  dependent
       definitions  are  contained  in  the file _h_d_r_s/_s_y_s_d_e_f_s._h and
       are;


       USE_EMBEDDED_ADDRESSES This controls the mailers response to
                      messages  that contain "Reply-To:" or "From:"
                      lines that actually contain a return address.
                      If  it's  defined, the mailer will attempt to
                      use the  address  specified  (overriding  the
                      return  address  built from the path that the

                                  Page 2

                      mail took).  It will look the address  up  in
                      the pathalias database (see the documentation
                      on the alias system)  for  incomplete  paths,
                      but it is still recommended that this be left
                      undefined.

                              This will, of course, make the mailer
                      not be a standard 'RFC-822' mailer, since the
                      mail system is defined to use the reply-to if
                      included rather than the return address, but,
                      at least for addresses on  the  Internet,  it
                      ain't going to work a lot of the time!

       FIND_DELTA     This is the delta that the binary  search  of
                      the  pathalias database will use to determine
                      when it's slicing up a  single  line,  rather
                      than  a  multitude  of lines.   Ideally, this
                      should be set to 1 byte less than  the  shor-
                      test  line  in  the  file...the default is 10
                      bytes.

       MAX_SALIASES   The number of system aliases allowed.  (It is
                      recommended  that  this  be a prime number to
                      improve the performance of the hashing  func-
                      tion (it's a complicated proof!))

       MAX_UALIASES   The number of user aliases allowed.   (should
                      be a prime number - see the comment above)

       MAX_IN_WEEDLIST The maximum number of headers  that  can  be
                      specified  in  the weedout list of the .elmrc
                      file.  A suggested  alternative  approach  if
                      this  number  is too small is to specify ini-
                      tial  substrings  in  the  file  rather  than
                      increasing  the number.  For example, say you
                      want to weedout the headers  "Latitude:"  and
                      "Latitudinal-Coords:",   you   could   simply
                      specify  "Latitud"  and  match   them   both!
                      Furthermore  you  could  also specify headers
                      like "X-" and remove  all  the  user  defined
                      headers!

       MAX_HOPS       When replying to a G)roup, this is  the  max-
                      imum  number  of hops that a message can have
                      taken.  This is used to try to  optimize  the
                      return  address  (remove  cyclic loops and so
                      on) and regular  use  should  show  that  the
                      default of 35 is plenty more than you'll ever
                      need!

       Elm Configuration Guide                          version 1.5



       MAX_ATTEMPTS   When   reading   in   the   default   mailbox
                      (/_u_s_r/_m_a_i_l/$_u_s_e_r_n_a_m_e)  the  mailer  creates a
                      file   called   /_u_s_r/_m_a_i_l/$_u_s_e_r_n_a_m_e._l_o_c_k   to
                      ensure  that  no  mail  is  added to the file
                      while it's being either read, or replaced (ie
                      written  to).   Occasionally,  this lock file
                      will already be in  place  since  someone  is
                      currently  sending you mail.  If this occurs,
                      the mailer will wait a few seconds and try to
                      create  the  lock file again.  This parameter
                      defines the number of tries the mailer should
                      take before giving up.

       REMOVE_AT_LAST When it does decide to give up  after  trying
                      to  create  the lock file, (see MAX_ATTEMPTS,
                      above) this will define how to act.  If  it's
                      defined,  the  mailer  will attempt to remove
                      the lock file after the MAX_ATTEMPTS timeout.
                      On  the  other hand, if it's not defined (the
                      recommended  state)  it'll  simply  quit  the
                      mailer,  telling  the  user to try again in a
                      few minutes.

       DEFAULT_BATCH_SUBJECT What the subject should be on messages
                      that are from redirected input but don't have
                      a subject specified...

       NOCHECK_VALIDNAME This disables the checking  of  validnames
                      on  the  existing  machine.  On machines that
                      run a system such as  _s_e_n_d_m_a_i_l  and  use  the
                      sendmail   alias   feature,  this  should  be
                      defined.  On other  systems  this  should  be
                      left  as  the  default (not defined) to avoid
                      users generating _d_e_a_d._l_e_t_t_e_r files...

       NO_VM          This disables  the  calls  to  "vfork()"  and
                      replaces  them  will  calls  to "fork()".  On
                      machines where  vfork()  is  available,  this
                      should be left undefined, as the virtual call
                      is considerably faster (and is only used when
                      the  spawned  process  doesn't  need  ALL the
                      stuff from the calling process!)

       ALLOW_BCC      If you are running  a  mail  transport  agent
                      that  can properly deal with the "Bcc" header
                      in messages, you should define this variable.
                      Otherwise  you'll  end  up with strange stuff
                      like people _k_n_o_w_i_n_g who got "bcc"s  of  their
                      mail...

       LOOK_CLOSE_AFTER_SEARCH Some systems are set up  in  such  a
                      way   as   to   have  direct  connections  to
                      machines, but to have multi-machine  hops  be
                      preferable  for  routing  messages to/through
                      that machine (an example is a  connection  to
                      "nbires" for the monthly mod.map information,
                      but only connected to  once  a  month!).   If
                      this  option is defined, then the system will
                      try to find a suitable path  to  the  machine
                      _b_e_f_o_r_e  it  checks  against  the _L._s_y_s/_u_u_n_a_m_e
                      list of systems that it can connect to.

       USE_UUNAME     The mailer tries to get the list of  machines
                      that's  its  connected  to  by looking in the
                      _L._s_y_s file.  If it  fails  usually,  it  will
                      then try to do a _u_u_n_a_m_e command and then read
                      the output  of  that  command.   If  this  is
                      defined,  however,  it  will  skip  the _L._s_y_s
                      reading and immediately try the _u_u_n_a_m_e call.

       DONT_OPTIMIZE_RETURN When saving the  return  address  of  a
                      current  message, the program will attempt to
                      store the minimum possible path.  Oftentimes,
                      however,  this isn't the ideal behaviour.  If
                      you don't want the program to do  this,  then
                      you should define this.

       DONT_TOUCH_ADDRESSES With  the  slow  entrance  of   various
                      delivery  agents  that  can dynamically route
                      things it becomes important that  the  mailer
                      _n_o_t  touch  addresses as entered by the user.
                      If this is the case at your site  (for  exam-
                      ple,  if you're running _s_m_a_i_l and _s_e_n_d_m_a_i_l as
                      a package) then you need to define this.

       AUTO_BACKGROUND If this is defined then the _n_e_w_m_a_i_l  program
                      automatically  puts itself into background as
                      soon as it's invoked.   Otherwise,  the  user
                      needs  to  have  a  trailing ampersand (as in
                      nnnneeeewwwwmmmmaaaaiiiillll &&&&) to  get  the  same  functionality.
                      (it  seems  reasonable  to assume that no-one
                      would ever run the utility  as  a  _f_o_r_e_g_r_o_u_n_d
                      process!!!)

       DONT_ADD_FROM  Some mail systems (like  my  own)  add  From:
                      lines  that  are  actually different than the
                      "default".  That is, the machine I send  mail
                      from  is "hpldat" so my From: line would nor-
                      mally be "hpldat!taylor" but it should  actu-
                      ally  be  "taylor@hplabs".   My sendmail will
                      add this correctly, so  this  allows  EEEEllllmmmm  to



                                  Page 5

                      defer  the  addition until then.  This should
                      only be used if your system is running  send-
                      mail  in  such  a  way  that it will add this
                      header as needed ONLY!

       INTERNET_ADDRESS_FORMAT For systems that prefer the Internet
                      addressing notation in the From: line, defin-
                      ing this will force that.  The default is  to
                      use  Usenet  notation  (_h_o_s_t_n_a_m_e!_u_s_e_r_n_a_m_e)  -
                      this will  change  it  to  Internet  notation
                      (_u_s_e_r_n_a_m_e@_h_o_s_t_n_a_m_e).

       PREFER_UUCP    On some mail systems, the local host automat-
                      ically appends their identification _i_n _I_n_t_e_r_-
                      _n_e_t _f_o_r_m_a_t to the addresses you receive (e.g.
                      ``ihnp4!snsvax!joe@hplabs.HP.COM''    is   an
                      address form I see, being directly connection
                      to  HPLABS, all too often).  This will simple
                      ensure  that  when  displaying   the   return
                      address  of  the  message  it will ignore the
                      Internet part if there's also  a  UUCP  part.
                      (This  is a kludge.  One should never have to
                      deal with this in a mail system... *sigh*)

       BOGUS_INTERNET After some serious thought,  I  came  to  the
                      conclusion  that the easiest way to deal with
                      the dumb  configuration  here  is  to  simply
                      strip  off  the  local  address part entirely
                      whenever possible.  Hence, this field defines
                      the  local  address that is added to the mes-
                      sage addresses needlessly.  This is  probably
                      the  single worst solution imaginable, but it
                      works...

       USE_DOMAIN     Define if you want to have the  _D_O_M_A_I_N  field
                      added  to  the _h_o_s_t_n_a_m_e in the From: field on
                      outbound mail  (note  that  this  only  makes
                      sense on Internet mail...)

       DOMAIN         If you choose to have the  USE_DOMAIN  define
                      set,  you  _M_U_S_T _D_E_F_I_N_E _T_H_I_S _A_C_C_O_R_D_I_N_G_L_Y!!!  A
                      typical entry would be;

                      #define DOMAINS        ".HP.COM"

       SAVE_GROUP_MAILBOX_ID If you're running the mailer set group
                      id   (usually  "setgid  mail")  then  this'll
                      ensure that the users mailbox, when  altered,
                      will  always retain its group id (obtained by
                      the "getegid()" call,  for  those  gurus  out
                      there who care).

       ENABLE_CALENDAR" If you want to  have  users  able  to  scan
                      their  mail for calendar entries (see the _E_l_m
                      _R_e_f_e_r_e_n_c_e _G_u_i_d_e) then  define  this  and  the
                      following  too.   (There  is no reason not to
                      have this, but power corrupts, right?)

       dflt_calendar_file The name of the default  "calendar"  file
                      if  the  user  doesn't  specify  one in their
                      ._e_l_m_r_c file.

       NOTES_HEADER   This defines the first  "word"  of  the  line
                      that a _n_o_t_e_s file entry would contain.

       NOTES_FOOTER   This  defines  the  footer  line   (in   it's
                      entirety).

       system_hash_file This is the file that contains  the  hashed
                      version  of  the  system aliases.  It is also
                      used in the _n_e_w_a_l_i_a_s command.  (note that  it
                      is defined differently if you're running on a
                      Berkeley system)

       system_data_file This is the other file the _n_e_w_a_l_i_a_s command
                      installs  in  the  system  alias area.  (Note
                      this is defined differently if you're runnnig
                      a bsd system)

       pathfile       This defines the location  of  the  pathalias
                      datafile.   This  file  is in the format that
                      _p_a_t_h_a_l_i_a_s generates, that is;

                          machine <tab> address

                      For further information, please see  the  _E_l_m
                      _A_l_i_a_s _S_y_s_t_e_m documentation.

       domains        This defines the location of the the  domains
                      database  file.  The format for this file and
                      so on are fully discussed in  the  _E_l_m  _A_l_i_a_s
                      _S_y_s_t_e_m document.

       Lsys           This defines where the system _L._s_y_s  file  is
                      kept.  This is used for the mailer to quickly
                      know what machines the  current  machine  can
                      talk  to  directly (to avoid trying to search
                      the pathalias database to route mail to these
                      machines).

       DEBUG          The name of the file to put in the users home
                      directory  if  they  choose  to  use the `-d'
                      debug option.

       readmsg_file   File  to  use  when  communicating  with  the
                      _r_e_a_d_m_s_g  program  (see  that program for more
                      information)

       signature_file The name of the file to  search  for  in  the
                      users  home  directory if they have _s_i_g_n_a_t_u_r_e
                      enabled in their ._e_l_m_r_c file.

       default_editor If no editor is specified in the users .elmrc
                      file,  this  is which editor to use.   Ensure
                      it is a valid editor on this machine!!  (Note
                      that  the default home for _v_i is different on
                      BSD machines)

       mailhome       Where all the  incoming  mailboxes  are,  and
                      also  where  the  'lock' files have to be put
                      for the mailer to know not to  add  new  mail
                      while  we're  reading/writing  the  mailfile.
                      (note that mail is kept in a different direc-
                      tory on Berkeley systems)

       default_pager  This is the standard pager to use for reading
                      messages.

       sendmail       Defines where _s_e_n_d_m_a_i_l is (if you have it  on
                      your system).

       smflags        Defines the flags to hand to _s_e_n_d_m_a_i_l if  and
                      when the program chooses to use it.

       mailer         If you  don't  have  _s_e_n_d_m_a_i_l,  this  is  the
                      mailer that'll be used.

       mailx          If all else fails, this mailer can be used in
                      a rather dumb way.

       helphome       Where the help file is kept (soon to be  help
                      files!)

       mailheaders    The name of the optional file that users  may
                      have  that will be included in the headers of
                      each outbound message.

       unedited_mail  In the strange case when the mailer  suddenly
                      finds  all  the  directories it uses shut off
                      (like /_u_s_r/_m_a_i_l and /_t_m_p) then it'll put  the
                      current  mailbox  into this file in the users
                      home directory.

       newalias       How to install new aliases..(note:  you  MUST
                      have the '-q' flag!)
