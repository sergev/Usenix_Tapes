               While there are a lot of mail systems that allow the
       transmission  of  text  and  primitive pictures, to send and
       reply to more complex forms is simply  not  possible.   EEEEllllmmmm,
       however, took the forms mode implemented as part of the AT&T
       Mail package and has expanded on it to  be  a  smoothly  fit
       part of the overall mail system.

       Forms mode gives you the ability to send 'template' files to
       people  and receive the filled-in replies.  Let's look at an
       example right off.


       Say we were going to use computer mail  as  a  way  to  file
       defects  with software.  There is a certain amount of infor-
       mation we want to be able to collect  when  each  report  is
       made,  and if it is in a specific format we can use programs
       to file the defects upon receipt.

       The form we'll try to emulate starts out looking like;

       This form can actually be created almost exactly  as  listed
       above  in  the EEEEllllmmmm mail system by using your standard editor
       and can then be mailed about as needed.

       Let's say that we want  a  bit  more  information,  however,
       especially with fields like ``Defect Type'', we want to list
       all the recommended answers.  To create the actual form,  we
       need merely to replace the underlines in the above form with
       spaces.  The multi-line comments can simply be indicated  by
       a `:' by itself on a line;

       Forms Mode Guide                                 version 1.5



       As we can see, it is quite simple to create forms!!


       Now that we have an idea what  we're  talking  about,  let's
       actually officially define the system...


       FFFFoooorrrrmmmmssss MMMMooooddddeeee SSSSppppeeeecccciiiiffffiiiiccccaaaattttiiiioooonnnn

       [Note that this is all taken from the document _S_t_a_n_d_a_r_d  _f_o_r
       _E_x_c_h_a_n_g_i_n_g  _F_o_r_m_s  _o_n _A_T&_T _M_a_i_l, Version 1.9 of 6/7/86, from
       AT&T]

       The forms mode is really quite simple.  Simple  enough  that
       it  is  amazing  that it hadn't been implemented before AT&T
       Mail came along!!

       In a nutshell, each field is delimited by a `:' followed  by
       a  number  of  blank spaces or tabs that represent the valid
       size for that field.  That is, if we have a line in the form
       like;
               ``Phone (area-code):     Number:          ''
       The area-code field will be limited to three characters  and
       the  number  to nine.  (this is kind of hard to see with the
       proportionally  spaced  formatted  copy,  alas).   The  only
       exception  to  the  rule  is  that a `:' by itself on a line
       represents a field that is as large as the user entering the
       data desires.


       The actual form that is transmitted, in AT&T Mail  parlance,
       is  a  ``SIMPLE''  forms  handler message (as opposed to the
       ``ADVANCED'' handler).  This means that  it  contains  three
       sections;

               The Message Header

               [OPTIONS-SECTION]
               ***
               [FORMS-IMAGE]
               ***
               [RULES-SECTION]

       EEEEllllmmmm generates form messages  with  the  ``options''  section
       filled  out, but ignores it when receiving mail.  The filled
       out section is;

               WIDTH=80
               TYPE=SIMPLE
               OUTPUT=TEXT




                                  Page 3







       Forms Mode Guide                                 version 1.5



       The  FORMS-IMAGE  section  is  that  described  above.   The
       RULES-SECTION  can contain explicit rules about the possible
       values of each field, but this is currently ignored by  EEEEllllmmmm,
       being a ``SIMPLE'' forms mode mail system.

       Forms also have the  header  ``Content-Type:  mailform''  to
       indicate to the mail system (either EEEEllllmmmm or AT&T Mail) that a
       form is being sent.

       EEEEllllmmmm further indicates that a form has been received by  hav-
       ing  an  ``F'' as the status character in the header display
       section (instead of ``N'' for new, etc).


       CCCCoooommmmppppoooossssiiiinnnngggg aaaannnndddd SSSSeeeennnnddddiiiinnnngggg aaaa FFFFoooorrrrmmmm

       The first step to enable sending forms is to change the set-
       ting  of  the  variable _f_o_r_m_s in your ._e_l_m_r_c file to ``ON''.
       E.g.;

               forms = ON

       The next step is to send the message to  someone  using  the
       `m' (_m_a_i_l) command.  This then will drop you into an editor.
       Type in the form as indicated above, with appropriate colons
       and comments, and end the entry by leaving the editor.

       The prompt is now;

    Choose: E)dit msg, edit H)eaders, M)ake form, S)end or F)orget : @

       so we choose `m' - _M_a_k_e _f_o_r_m.  The program then will  either
       rewrite the prompt without the M)ake form option, indicating
       that the form has been accepted, or will indicate the  prob-
       lem and give you a chance to correct it.

       Once it has been accepted, simple use the `s' - _s_e_n_d _m_e_s_s_a_g_e
       - command and it's off!

       Note that you cannot reply to a message with a Form.


       RRRReeeeppppllllyyyyiiiinnnngggg ttttoooo aaaa FFFFoooorrrrmmmm

       Let's reply to the  form  message  we  generated  now.   The
       header  page  of  the EEEEllllmmmm mail system will indicate that the
       message is a form by having an `F' next to it.   So  we  use
       `r' to reply and the screen is immediately cleared and we're
       prompted, field by field,  for  the  data  requested.   Each
       field has underscores in the input area to indicate the size
       field that is expected.

       Quite simple.  Notice, however, that the order of  prompting
       is  left  to  right  on each line, so the fields that on the
       form are placed in what seems like  a  logical  place,  ``By
       Whom:'' and ``Phone:'' turn out to be confusing when filling
       in the actual form since it isn't clear what  ``Phone:''  is
       being  asked  for  because of the intervention of the ``Date
       Reported:'' field.

       The message that will actually be sent out  from  this  will
       have the fields in a more acceptable format;

       As was said at the beginning,  this  way  of  sending  about
       forms could prove to be very helpful and useful in a variety
       of contexts.  On the other hand, until a more  sophisticated
       forms  language is used for the forms, this should be suffi-
       cient to embody the power of the idea.

       I welcome any comments and thoughts on this system and  also
       welcome possible enhancements.

       I also gratefully thank Dale  DeJager  of  AT&T  Information
       Systems  for sending me more information on AT&T Mail than I
       could possibly digest in any finite amount of time.
