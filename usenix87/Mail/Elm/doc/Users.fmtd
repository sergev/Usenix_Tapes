       While various parts of the Unix  system  have  been  updated
       into  the  `CRT' age (rather than the `teletype') electronic
       mail systems haven't.  This document presents _E_l_m, a sophis-
       ticated  full-screen  mail  system for interactive use.  _E_l_m
       offers all the features of /_b_i_n/_m_a_i_l, _B_e_r_k_e_l_e_y _M_a_i_l, _u_u_m_a_i_l,
       _N_M_a_i_l  and  the  AT&T  Mail  family  of Unix mailers (namely
       _P_M_X/_T_E_R_M) in a unified and intuitive fashion.

               The Unix8TM9 operating system was  originally  written
       on a small PDP machine to work with teletypewriters.  Conse-
       quently, all the original software for the operating  system
       was  written  with  a  `tty'  in  mind  - they were all line
       oriented, rather than screen oriented.

               Gradually this began to change, and, with the  addi-
       tion  of the Berkeley _v_i visual shell to the _e_d line editor,
       the trend began to be brought to the attention of Unix  sys-
       tems designers.

               Unfortunately, however, this transition was far  too
       subtle for most software designers, and today there are pre-
       cious few programs distributed with the Unix system,  either
       from  Berkeley,  AT&T  or  variations thereof, that are full
       screen oriented.

               Consequently, after becoming more  and  more  disen-
       chanted  with  the existing electronic mail facilities (_m_a_i_l


       __________

           Historical note: shrewd users will recognize this as
           being based on the old Unix mailer _M_s_g.  The name was
           changed to avoid a conflict with an old DEC-20 mailer,
           and because the new name stands for EEEELLLLectronic MMMMail,
           which I think works out better!

       and _B_e_r_k_e_l_e_y  _M_a_i_l,  both  of  which  are  line-oriented)  I
       decided  to  write  my  own!   Once  the ball was rolling it
       became hard not to enhance it  to  death,  especially  as  I
       became  more  and  more familiar with various different mail
       systems, but the result, I hope, is a solid, unified  inter-
       face to electronic mail suitable for almost any environment.

               The EEEEllllmmmm mail system comes with five documents, enti-
       tled;  _T_h_e  _E_l_m  _U_s_e_r_s  _G_u_i_d_e, which you're holding, _T_h_e _E_l_m
       _R_e_f_e_r_e_n_c_e _G_u_i_d_e, _T_h_e _E_l_m _A_l_i_a_s _U_s_e_r_s _G_u_i_d_e,  _T_h_e  _E_l_m  _F_o_r_m_s
       _M_o_d_e  _G_u_i_d_e,  and _T_h_e _E_l_m _C_o_n_f_i_g_u_r_a_t_i_o_n _G_u_i_d_e.  The names of
       each indicate what they discuss (not unreasonably).

               This particular document  contains;  this  introduc-
       tion,  a  tutorial  session with the mailer, a discussion of
       non-interactive uses of EEEEllllmmmm, a  brief  foray  into  the  EEEEllllmmmm
       utilities, and finally, credits and references.

               The _E_l_m _R_e_f_e_r_e_n_c_e _G_u_i_d_e contains;  a  discussion  of
       the ._e_l_m_r_c file, starting options of EEEEllllmmmm,,,, outgoing mail pro-
       cessing, responses of various  commands,  the  mail  archive
       file,  the  Limit  command, the Alias system, system aliases
       etc, more on the utilities, and a section for  expert  users
       and debugging.

               The _E_l_m _A_l_i_a_s _U_s_e_r_s _G_u_i_d_e contains; a  further  dis-
       cussion  of _u_s_e_r _a_l_i_a_s_e_s and _g_r_o_u_p _a_l_i_a_s_e_s,  System aliases,
       how to edit and install new aliases,  the  hostname  routing
       database, the domain routing database, and so on.

               The _E_l_m _F_o_r_m_s _M_o_d_e _G_u_i_d_e is  a  tutorial  for  those
       interested in sending AT&T Mail-style forms to each other.

               The _E_l_m _C_o_n_f_i_g_u_r_a_t_i_o_n _G_u_i_d_e discusses how to install
       and  custom configure the mail system to your local machine.
       This is probably only of interest to system adminstrators or
       those  interested in modifying the source code, which should
       be  freely  available.    It   is   recommended   that   the
       _c_o_n_f_i_g_u_r_e._s_h script be used for most standard installations.


               Any comments or problems with any of the  documenta-
       tion  or  the program itself are welcome: all installed sys-
       tems should have an alias that will ensure  that  I  receive
       any mail sent to `elm'.

       There are a number of things to notice about this screen;

         +o First off, it's quite possible that on your  screen  the
           current  message  will  be  indicated  by an inverse bar
           rather than an arrow. Don't worry about it -  it's  just
           harder  to  have  an  inverse  bar in a document than an
           arrow!

         +o The top line always displays the current mail file,  the
           number of messages in the file, and the current EEEEllllmmmm ver-
           sion number.

         +o The arrow (``->'') (or bar) always points to the current
           message.

         +o The first few characters on each line can  indicate  the
           following:

                U -  an _Urgent message





                                  Page 3







       Elm Users Guide                                  Version 1.5



                N -  a _New message since you last read mail

                E -  an _Expired message (not yet implemented)

                A -  an _Action is associated with the message

                D -  the message is marked for _Deletion

                + -  the message is _T_a_g_g_e_d.

         +o Continuing from left to right, the  next  field  is  the
           message  number.  For the most part you can ignore these
           unless you want to quickly move to  a  specific  message
           (as we'll see later)

         +o The date associated with each message is  the  date  the
           person _s_e_n_t the message.

         +o The next field displayed indicates who  the  message  is
           from. EEEEllllmmmm will try to display the _n_a_m_e of the person who
           sent  the  message,  rather  than   the   their   return
           address/login.  Some  systems don't generate the correct
           headers, though, hence messages like  number  11,  where
           it's the return address of the sender...

         +o The number in parentheses is the total number  of  lines
           in the message.

         +o The final field is the subject of the  message.   Notice
           that message 3 has no subject.

         +o A maximum of twelve messages are displayed at  one  time
8           19.  Further into the document we'll learn how to  change
           'pages' in the mailbox.

         +o The three line Menu display  will  always  indicate  the
           relevant  commands.   There  are  actually  two possible
           menus that can be displayed, based on the _u_s_e_r _l_e_v_e_l  as
           set  from either the O)ptions screen or the ._e_l_m_r_c file.
           The second menu, for more  advanced  users,  lists  more
           options;

           |=pipe, !=shell, ?=help, <n>=set current to n, /=search pattern


       __________

        1. On terminals with greater than 25 lines, more messages
           will be displayed automatically.  Further, if you choose
           to turn off the Menu display, you can have more too.

           N)ext, O)ptions, P)rint, R)eply, S)ave, T)ag, Q)uit, U)ndelete, or eX)it


         +o Finally, the '@' character indicates  where  the  cursor
           would be, awaiting your input.

       The typical action at this point is to use the <_r_e_t_u_r_n>  key
       to  read  the current message.  This particular option actu-
       ally isn't noted in  the  Menu  display,  but  choosing  the
       '?=help' option will inform you of a number of choices other
       than those in the basic menu!

       Pressing this key will clear the screen and display the mes-
       sage using the local pager (see _p_a_g_e_r in the ._e_l_m_r_c file).

       While reading is perhaps the most fundamental function  that
       the  EEEEllllmmmm  program  performs,  there  are  a  number of other
       options available, namely;

          ?                  Help mode - any key  pressed  will  be
                             explained.

          *, or

                             lines.

        3. The difference between _F_o_r_w_a_r_d and _B_o_u_n_c_e is rather
           subtle -- a forwarded message is ``from'' you, with the
           original message included, whereas a bounced message is
           still from the original sender.

       Message #13 from Jack        Mailed April 3, 1985 at 8:45 pm

       I just found my old Lawrence Welk Platinum Hits series of albums and recall you
       saying that you really enjoy listening to that sort of drivel...

       So, do you want to buy them off of me before I make ashtrays out of them (or frisbees...)?

                                                         Humourously,
                                                                         Jack






       Press <return> to return to Elm: @

       Needless to say, we can't let this  message  go  by  without
       replying!   So let's press <_r_e_t_u_r_n>, then use the _r_e_p_l_y com-
       mand to respond.

       After pressing the `_r' key, the program asks if  a  copy  of
       the message is desired (the character under the cursor indi-
       cates the default if <return> is pressed.  In this case, the
       default is 'no');

           copy message? (y/n) @

       We choose to answer no, so press  the  `_n'  key.   Next  EEEEllllmmmm
       displays whom the message will be sent to849 and verifies that
       the subject is okay;

           Command: Reply                              To: Jack
           Subject of Message: Re: Wanna buy some albums cheap?@

       Typing anything other than <return> will allow us to  change
       the  subject to something more appropriate.  We decide, how-
       ever, to leave it be and press <_r_e_t_u_r_n> again.



       __________

        4. The default action of the mailer is to display just the
           name of the person or persons the message will be sent
           to.  If the actual address is also desired, then the
           user needs to include "names=OFF" in their ._e_l_m_r_c file.
           See the _E_l_m _R_e_f_e_r_e_n_c_e _G_u_i_d_e for more information on
           this.

       The program then puts us in the (default) _v_i editor  with  a
       newly created file

       After having entered a suitable reply, and left the  editor,
       the EEEEllllmmmm system then verifies that we really want to send the
       message with;

           Are you sure you want to send this message? (y/n) @

       To which our response is `_y' for 'yes'.  It then  sends  the
       message  off  to  Jack,  who will receive it hopefully quite
       soon (or at least  before  he  makes  ashtrays  out  of  the
       albums!)


       Message 13 is still the current message, so, now let's  save
       it  and  the  one after it from Jack, message 14, by _t_a_g_g_i_n_g
       them both.  We press `_t' for _t_a_g, which  puts  the  '+'  tag
       indicator on this message, move to the next message with the
       `_j' key, then press `_s' for _s_a_v_e

       This prompts for the file to save to;

          Save messages to: @

       to which we answer =_j_a_c_k.  The two messages are  then  saved
       to the specified file, marked for deletion, and the _t_a_g_s are
       removed from them.

       Note five not only looks  mildly  interesting  but  it's  an
       UUUUrgent message too!  So let's read it by typing _5<_r_e_t_u_r_n> to



                                 Page 10







       Elm Users Guide                                  Version 1.5



       make that the current message, and press <_r_e_t_u_r_n>  again  to
       read  it.   After  reading  the  message we decide that it's
       utterly worthless, not even worth  replying  to,  let  alone
       saving,  so  we'll  mark it for future deletion with the `d'
       _d_e_l_e_t_e key.

       A `D' is put next to the message now...

       Before we finish up, we suddenly remember that  one  of  the
       messages  was supposed to be about how to write decent docu-
       mentation for Unix software, so let's try to find it...

       First off, we'll move back to message one with the  `='  key
       and then use the `/' _p_a_t_t_e_r_n _m_a_t_c_h_i_n_g command:

           Command : Pattern                   / = match anywhere in messages
           Match pattern: @

       we'll type in _d_o_c_u_m_e_n_t (it's case insensitive)  and  see  if
       the  system  can  find  it.   After a brief second or two it
       returns 'pattern not found.' Hmm...maybe it's not either the
       from  or the subject of any of the messages...In case that's
       true, let's try using the _m_a_t_c_h _a_n_y_w_h_e_r_e _i_n _m_e_s_s_a_g_e command;

       We again type `/' for _p_a_t_t_e_r_n _m_a_t_c_h_i_n_g;

           Command : Pattern                           / = match anywhere in messages
           Match pattern: @

       And now we'll use `/' again to get  the  match  anywhere  in
       file option.  Now the bottom of the screen looks like;

           Command : Pattern                           / = match anywhere in messages
           Match pattern (in entire mailbox): @

       to which we respond _d_o_c_u_m_e_n_t again.

       The mailer then searches through each line of all  the  mes-
       sages  in  the file and moves the current message pointer to
       message number 7.  A quick check reveals that  this  message
       indeed contains the word `document', but it's not the one we
       want, so we're going to just get outta here!

       We've had enough mail for today, so lets quit,  leaving  all
       the  mail  in  the  incoming mailbox, except those few we've
       marked for deletion;

       _Q_u_i_t prompts;

          Delete messages? (y/n) @




                                 Page 11







       Elm Users Guide                                  Version 1.5



       to which we answer `_y' for yes.  The next prompt is then;

          Keep mail in incoming mailbox? (y/n) @

       to which we also answer yes...the program then quickly saves
       the  files,  removing message 5, 13 and 14 as it goes along,
       and exits.



       As you can see, the program is pretty easy to use!  In fact,
       it  was  designed  to  be used without this documentation at
       all, so you could toss this right now (but don't - think  of
       the  tree  that  sacrificed  its precious life to allow this
       printout!)

               Before we discuss the EEEEllllmmmm utilities, it's worth not-
       ing  that  there  are a couple of other ways to use the main
       mail system, namely to 'send only' and to send files (batch-
       mail).

               To send a message to  someone  without  any  of  the
       associated overhead of the main system being loaded, you can
       invoke the mailer with the name(s) of the people to send to.
       The  mailer  will  then prompt for Subject, Copies, and then
       drop you in your editor (defined in the ._e_l_m_r_c file) to com-
       pose  the  message.   When composition is complete, the pro-
       gram verifies transmission then terminates.  For example;

         $ eeeellllmmmm ddddaaaavvvveeee____ttttaaaayyyylllloooorrrr
         To: taylor@hplabs.HP.COM
         Subject: tttthhhhiiiissss iiiissss aaaa tttteeeesssstttt
         Copies To: <<<<rrrreeeettttuuuurrrrnnnn>>>>

         <invokes editor, message composed, then>

         Are you sure you want to send this? (y/n) yyyy

         mail sent.

         $

       Note that the user input is in bbbboooolllldddd face,  so  you  can  see
       that the mailer verified the alias expansion too!

               The mailer also  supports  batch  type  mailing,  of
       files and so on, by using the following command;

         $ eeeellllmmmm ddddaaaavvvveeee____ttttaaaayyyylllloooorrrr <<<< hhhheeeellllpppp....cccc

       which will read in the file and transmit it to the specified

               The EEEEllllmmmm mail system is really much more than a  sin-
       gle  program  for  reading and writing mail.  It's a unified
       environment  for  intelligently  dealing   with   electronic
       correspondence.   As  a consequence, it contains a number of
       other programs to aid in the  easy  processing  of  `email',
       including the following;

         answer      An  answering-machine  transcription  program.
                     Please  see the `man'ual entry for more infor-
                     mation on how to use this program.

         autoreply   This program, in conjunction with the  ``arep-
                     daemon'', enables users to automatically reply
                     to incoming mail  when  they're  not  directly
                     available...

         checkalias  A script for checking aliases simply.

         messages    A script that lists the number of messages  in
                     the  specified  mailbox.   Suitable  for login
                     scripts and such.

         newalias    This program installs new aliases - please see
                     the  _E_l_m  _A_l_i_a_s  _U_s_e_r_s _G_u_i_d_e for more informa-
                     tion.

         newmail     This program is designed to be put into `back-
                     ground'  and then monitors your incoming mail-
                     box for new mail.  Whenever  you  receive  new
                     mail, the program will asynchronously write to
                     the screen a notification, including whom  the
                     new  mail is from and what the subjects of the
                     messages are.  The output looks like;

                     >> New mail from Jimmy Carter - Urgent matters of state
                     >> New mail from joe@ucbvax.arpa - Did I hear someone say PARTY??

                     This is quite helpful for  deciding  in  `real
                     time'  whether it's necessary to read the mail
                     immediately or not.

         wnewmail    This is extremely similar to  _n_e_w_m_a_i_l  but  is
                     slightly   modified  to  run  in  a  windowing
                     environment.   The  differences  are  that  it
                     stays  in  `foreground' (thereby taking over a
                     window entirely), and outputs for new mail  in
                     a slightly more succint format;

                     Mail from Jimmy Carter -- Urgent matters of state
                     Mail From joe@ucbvax.arpa -- Did I hear someone say PARTY??

         readmsg     This handy little program can be used  in  two
                     ways...first  off,  it  can  be used to easily
                     read a specific message in the incoming  mail-
                     box,  specified by ordinal number, by a string
                     that the message contains, by the  metacharac-
                     ter  `$'  which represents the last message in
                     the mailbox, or `*' which matches all the mes-
                     sages in the folder or mailbox.

                     For example;

                     $ rrrreeeeaaaaddddmmmmssssgggg 4444 5555 9999 |||| llllpppprrrr

                     would generate a  printout,  _s_a_n_s  superfluous
                     headers,  of  the fourth, fifth and ninth mes-
                     sages in your mailbox.

                     $ rrrreeeeaaaaddddmmmmssssgggg CCCCaaaarrrrtttteeeerrrr |||| ppppaaaaggggeeee

                     would be a fast way to read  what  `ole  Jimmy
                     has to say...  and

                     $ rrrreeeeaaaaddddmmmmssssgggg ----hhhh hhhheeeeaaaarrrr ssssoooommmmeeeeoooonnnneeee ssssaaaayyyy

                     would list, including all the message headers,
                     the message containing the string ``hear some-
                     one say''.

         from        Similar to the  Berkeley  _f_r_o_m  command,  this
                     will  give  you  a  ``table  of  contents'' of
                     either the current mailbox  or  a  mailbox  of
                     your choice.   It's useful to see what mail is
                     pending, or what's in a mailbox.  If used with
                     the  `-n'  option, it will number each message



                                 Page 14







       Elm Users Guide                                  Version 1.5



                     in a way compatible with the arguments _r_e_a_d_m_s_g
                     expects to get, too!

         printmail   This is a formatting routine that  knows  that
                     mailboxes   look   like   and  inserts  either
                     formfeeds or dashed  lines  between  messages.
                     It  can be used in either of two ways - either
                     a mailbox file can be _p_i_p_e_d to it or it can be
                     given  a list of mailbox file names to format.
                     The only option on the program is  `-d'  which
                     indicates  that you want to have a dashed line
                     separating messages rather than a formfeed.

                     For example;

                     $ pppprrrriiiinnnnttttmmmmaaaaiiiillll ----dddd |||| llllpppprrrr

                     will print out your current incoming  mailbox,
                     separating the messages by a dashed line.

                     $ rrrreeeeaaaaddddmmmmssssgggg 3333 4444 11110000 |||| pppprrrriiiinnnnttttmmmmaaaaiiiillll |||| llllpppprrrr

                     will print messages 3, 4,  and  10  from  your
                     incoming mailbox, separated by formfeeds (that
                     is, each message will start on it's own page).

                     Finally,

                     $ pppprrrriiiinnnnttttmmmmaaaaiiiillll ~~~~////mmmmbbbbooooxxxx ~~~~////MMMMaaaaiiiillll////mmmmaaaaiiiillll....sssseeeennnntttt |||| llllpppprrrr

                     will print all the messages saved in _m_b_o_x  and
                     in your _m_a_i_l._s_e_n_t files.  The second file will
                     be started on a new  page  regardless  of  the
                     presence  or  absence  of the `-d' dashed line
                     option.

                     It should be noted that  _p_r_i_n_t_m_a_i_l  is  almost
                     competely  superseded  by the _r_e_a_d_m_s_g command.
                     For example, the second example above could be
                     more easily and quickly written as;

                     $ rrrreeeeaaaaddddmmmmssssgggg ----pppp 3333 4444 11110000 |||| llllpppprrrr

                     It is expected in future  releases  that  this
                     program will not be included.

         newalias    This  is  used  to  install   new   user/group
                     aliases.  Please see the _E_l_m _A_l_i_a_s _U_s_e_r_s _G_u_i_d_e

         fastmail    Sometimes you want to have a batchmailing sys-
                     tem  that  works  as  quickly as possible, not
                     bothering with aliases or  any  of  the  other
                     ``deluxe''  features  of  EEEEllllmmmm.   An example of
                     this would be if you have a large mailing list
                     for  a  newsletter,  say.  This command, _f_a_s_t_-
                     _m_a_i_l, is designed just for that  purpose.   It
                     avoids  the  lengthy startup time of EEEEllllmmmm while
                     still generating valid _R_F_C-_8_2_2859 mail.   Please

               This mailer has been  evolving  over  the  past  few
       years  with invaluable comments on the interface and general
       mail issues from the  following  people;  Walter  Underwood,
       Larry  Fenske, Rob Sartin, John Dilley (who got the Spectrum
       version checked out, too!) and Carl Dierschow.

       For the Berkeley implementation, lots of help came from John
       Lebovitz and Ken Stone.

       For the Amdahl/UTS implementation, thanks to Scott  McGregor
       and Stan Isaacs.

       For the Sun problems, Dave England in Lancaster (UK)  turned
       out to be ``bloody useful'', as he would no doubt say.

       The Pyramid version is due to the work of  Steve  Malone  of
       the University of Washington.

       A number of other people have been amazingly disciplined  at
       reporting problems and (usually, much to my relief) indicat-
       ing the fixes needed, especially Guy Hillyer, Bruce Townsend
       and Eric Negaard.

       There have been many, many others, too numerous to  mention,
       that have inspired me with questions like "Why can't Elm..."
       or "Why does it ..." or "Can we make  it..."  too.   A  loud
       round of applause and an enthusiastic THANK YOU to you all!!

       Also helpful was the ability to have  my  `own'  machine  to
       close  up  the  many many iterative loops that this software
       has gone through - since being on a big  multi-user  machine
       tends  to slow it down to a standstill...  For that, I thank
       Hewlett-Packard Colorado Networks Division for their initial
       support,  and  now HP Laboratories for the wonderful working
       environment that I have here (more than any  one  person  is
       safe having, most likely!)

       Mailers that have influenced the design  and  implementation
       of EEEEllllmmmm, for better or worse, include the following;

        /_b_i_n/_m_a_i_l   The most basic of mailers, this one was  simply
                   the  example  of  how  _n_o_t  to force the user to
                   interact with a program.

        _B_e_r_k_e_l_e_y _M_a_i_l   A suprisingly sophisticated  mailer,  espe-
                   cially  the  version with 4.3 BSD, _B_e_r_k_e_l_e_y _M_a_i_l
                   still suffers from the  tendency  to  force  the
                   user to know too much about the system, and also
                   lacks a friendly, non-cryptic interface for  the
                   large subset of the population that use Unix but
                   aren't interested in becoming a ``hacker''.

        _M_H         This is another nifty mailer.  The main  differ-
                   ence between this and the other mailers about is
                   that it is a discrete  set  of  programs  rather
                   than  a single unified interface.  This is quite
                   useful for those people  that  receive  _l_o_t_s  of
                   mail and are willing to spend some time learning
                   the intricacies  of  the  program.   It's  quite
                   powerful,  but  again,  misses some of the basic
                   friendly features  the  majority  of  users  are
                   interested in.

        _d_m_a_i_l      A sort of mutated cross between _M_H and  _B_e_r_k_e_l_e_y
                   _M_a_i_l,  it  was this program that convinced me to
                   implement the _L_i_m_i_t functions.

        _N_M_a_i_l      (a  part  of  the  HP  AI  Workstation  Software
                   Environment).   This  program hints at the power
                   that mailers could be given to  help  deal  with
                   mail  in  a quick and intelligent fashion.  Most
                   of what it can do, and a lot more, are therefore
                   part  of  EEEEllllmmmm.   Indubitably.   And quite faster
                   too!

        _P_M_X/_T_E_R_M   Part of the AT&T Mail package, a  single  glance
                   at  this interface convinced me that a PC inter-
                   face, with almost half of the screen taken up by
                   a  silly function key mapping, is most certainly
                   _n_o_t the way to do things!!  On the  other  hand,
                   it  also  shows that the _F_o_r_m_s mode can be quite
                   nicely  integrated  into  a  more  sophisticated
                   mailer.

        _f_m_a_i_l      A nickel addition to the  /_b_i_n/_m_a_i_l  program  to
                   add  some  rudimentary  screen  interface stuff,
                   this nonetheless interesting mailer is  part  of
                   the AT&T Toolchest.

        _L_a_u_r_e_l     A program only available within Xerox PARC, this
                   was  an  interesting early attempt at a graphics
                   based  full-screen  mail  program.    The   one,
                   perhaps  trivial, part of the interface I really
                   like was the fact that it would _c_r_o_s_s _o_u_t a mes-
                   sage that was marked for deletion.  One day when
                   we get real graphics and the ability to use them
                   indicated  in a facility (not too) like _t_e_r_m_c_a_p,
                   perhaps EEEEllllmmmm will do this too!

        _M_a_i_l_t_o_o_l   Part of the Sun distribution package, this  pro-
                   gram  is  a  really  nice example of what can be
                   done by putting a smart shell on top of  a  dumb
                   program  -  it uses /_b_i_n/_m_a_i_l for all the `dirty
                   work'.  Other than that, it's not a particularly
                   interesting  interface  or  mailer,  and it cer-
                   tainly doesn't add much functionality!

        _F_r_a_n_k_e_n_m_a_i_l   This program is another _B_e_r_k_e_l_e_y  _M_a_i_l  style
                   of  interface,  for  the  most part.  This means
                   that it is still just as difficult  to  use  for
                   the  neophyte  Unix user.  The interface is more
                   interesting when  used  on  a  Sun  Microsystems
                   machine, but _F_r_a_n_k_e_n_m_a_i_l isn't a step forward in
                   mail technologies or interfaces.

        _M_e_t_a_m_a_i_l   What can I say?  This isn't even a real  mailer,
                   but  is  just what I dream of as an interface to
                   mail in the future.  A program that  works  sort
                   of like HHHHAAAALLLL did in _2_0_0_1: _A _S_p_a_c_e _O_d_y_s_s_e_y - where
                   it interrupts me as  appropriate  for  important
                   mail,  and  can  answer  inane and other queries
                   itself according to what I teach it.  Maybe EEEEllllmmmm,
                   by  some  sort  of groupmind metamorphosis, will
                   change into that  someday.   Maybe  not.   Maybe
                   no-one  bothers  to read this far into the docu-
                   ment!!

       Finally, it's also been a very  useful  experience  overall,
       confirming  my  beliefs  that  iterative software design and
       keeping a close watch on users (not to mention an open  mind
       and  mailbox!) improves a product manyfold.  Comments, feed-
       back and bug reports (and fixes!)  are,  of  course,  always
       welcome!
