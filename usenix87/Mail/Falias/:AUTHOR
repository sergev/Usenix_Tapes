This is one of those things which everyone has a go at - making a
full-name / forwarding database to use with sendmail.

The problem:  a multi-host site connected only by UUCP, users ( apart
from the admin group ) on one m/c only.  Requirement, generate an
aliases database to do full name aliasing and forwarding to the
appropriate m/c.

My answer "falias" is enclosed, it assumes BSD "finger" type entries, 
( & is expanded ), also assumes uids in the range 0-9 are for system
admin types who will have their .forwards, or uucp/news type users.

A leading # in the password field indicates a "dead user" as does a
password field of "*".  The first sed script strips out some other
undesirables on my system(s), as well as doing some tidying up.

In use list the sites is the order of precedance, as the users on the
first site will "clobber" those with the same login on the second,
etc.

I hope this saves someone a few hours work, if you like it, let me
know, I also read flames until they become tedious.
