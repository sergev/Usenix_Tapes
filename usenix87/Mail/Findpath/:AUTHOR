Here are three utilities for those sites running the "pathalias" program to do
the following:
1) Look up the database and print out the path corresponding to any UUCP site.
2) Generate a database where the UUCP site is the key and the filename
   containing the description of that site is the data.
3) Look up the database built by program (2).

The programs are called "findpath", "findfile" and "mapfile" respectively.
I am sorry that I haven't had time to produce manual pages but I find these
programs essential for those sites who use "pathalias".
