This is a mail forwarding utility for systems, like V7, which do not
have mailers with a forwarding feature.  The BSD mailer has a built-in,
undocumented, forwarding service.  The forwarding utility here observes
the BSD convention for specifying forwarding.  The program, then, is
primarily useful for people on networks with some non-BSD machines.
I wrote it because I found myself in such an environment.  It has been
tested and runs under V7 and 4.1.

Some mods to the source may be needed for your particular configuration.
Check that MAILDIR is right.  The man page describes usage.  If anyone
upgrades this utility, I would appreciate receiving the upgrades.
As usual, this code can be used for anything you want, except outright
selling it for a profit.
