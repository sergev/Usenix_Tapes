As quoted from <561@van-bc.UUCP> by sl@van-bc.UUCP:

My goodness, that critter's popular.  I think it's got a wider distribution
than UNaXcess Conferencing, for all that I sent it out once with no fanfare.

Yes, a new version of ims(1) is in the works as part of UNaXcess Mail.  I
find it interesting that the first version, which was basically a little
critter I wrote for my own purposes anbd decided to post ``just because'',
is used as THE mailer on a number of local systems, and I get a fair amount of
mail on it still.
