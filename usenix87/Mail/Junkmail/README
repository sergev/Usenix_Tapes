Junkmail is designed to be run from "cron" or "at" on a regular basis
in order to keep the size of /usr/spool/mail within reasonable limits.
It deletes old/large mail according to criteria described in the manual
page, and settable at compile or run time.

It should be compatible with 4.x BSD; don't know about AT&T Unix.

It is also capable of deleting all mail from a specified user--a feature
which is occasionally handy when a malicious/naive user discovers mail.
