A while back I posted a program to handle unix mail while you
were away for a while. Although it did some smart stuff (according to 
me the author), some people wanted things just a little different. So
now there is for those mailaway.C which for each message waiting to
be read, determines things like the author, the size the subject
etc. and then lets you execute a shell routine which can work on
the mail message. (For more details see manual page in next
posting).

Feel free to use or misuse this program.
