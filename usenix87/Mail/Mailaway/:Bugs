#! /bin/sh

# The mailway program recently posted failed to work on my system,
# mostly because the system V and bsd mail programs are quite
# different.  It also could not handle general mail addresses, such as
# "a@b", "a%b", and "@a:b", so it has been fixed to handle these (other
# types may pop up, and will also be handle as I can manage.  Also,
# there was a '=' instead of '==' bug.  Here is a copy of the source
# and manual page, as a shar file.  To compile for System V systems,
# compile with -DSYSV.  Otherwise it will compile for Berkeley.  The
# changes are
#
#	(a)	Work with Berkeley Mail program
#	(b)	Run under non-sysV systems (only tested on 4.3bsd)
#	(c)	Add a -m flag to specifiy an alternate mail file
#	(d)	Handle general net addressing (at least normal ones)
#	(e) 	Fix a bug
#	(f)	Optimize a couple of things
#
# While I was at it, I also redid mailaway.1 to fit the standard manual
# style, since I had to update the page to include the new option.
