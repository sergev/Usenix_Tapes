Subject: mh-e bug for users of "draftfolder"s (w/ fix)
Date: 11 Jun 86 20:03:43 CDT (Wed)
From: Matt Crawford <seismo!lbl-csam.ARPA!oddjob!matt>

When not inside emacs I use the draftfolder feature of MH.
This makes "repl -build" and "forw -build" leave their
results in a folder.  Adding the "-nodraftfolder" switch
solves the problem, tho' you could make a case that -build
ought to imply this.  Diff from 17.64 follows:
