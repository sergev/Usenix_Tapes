Actually, I did look at the code for "anno" (actually it's in
"annosbr.c"), and the change to not timestamp, or to timestamp second
rather than first, would be trivial.  However, I was afraid the I
would be breaking something else, and anyway I figured that it was
quite possible for there to exist a mechanism to do what I want
without changing the code.  I'm beginning to get the idea that such a
change is in order, though.  I'll post diffs.
