Subject: SERIUS bug in INC!!!
Date: Wed, 01 Apr 87 11:04:38 O



There is a SERIUS bug in the inc command. 

If you run out of diskspace for the folders, inc produces
empty messages, AND clears your mailbox. Inc didn't check
the status from WRITING on the disk.

Did anyone has a bugfix to this ???

I'm running MH on a Sun3 with the following configuration.
