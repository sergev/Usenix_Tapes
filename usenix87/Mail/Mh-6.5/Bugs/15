# It may not be MH's fault. Sun NFS has a hole where if the server runs
# out of disk space, the clients don't get any error return on a write.

Apparently this depends on how you set you /etc/fstab

Here's an extract from ours:

rain:/usr4 /usr4 nfs rw,hard,bg 1 2

I'm told by Sun that you should never have rw,soft, since clients  don't
get any error  return on  a write.   If you  just set  rw,hard, you  get
problems if you try and reboot more than one machine at a time.
