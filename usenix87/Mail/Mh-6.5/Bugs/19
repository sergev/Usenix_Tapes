Subject: Bug in repl (New Fix).
Date: Thu, 02 Apr 87 19:14:58 O


This is a better fix to the bug in repl. The first one 
works but it just fix the symptom not the real bug.
I am sorry for this double mail.


Index: .../mh/uip/replsbr.c

Description:
	The repl(1) command, part of MH-6.4, dumps core on a computer
	which did not accepts nil pointers e.g. Sun. If we don't want
	the field and it is a long field so we get the state FLDPLUS.


Repeat-By:
	Use repl(1) on a Sun with a very long To list in the
	message you reply to.


Fix:
	Don't get the rest of the field if we don't want the field.
