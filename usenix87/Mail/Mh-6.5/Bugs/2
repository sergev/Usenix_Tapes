Thanks to mike for finding this one...  The upshot is that ferror() returns
true if feof() is set.  BSD UNIX doesn't work like this.  Neither, I believe

I fiddled around with bbc, and the following diff has a change for
bbc.c that fixes the problem I had with bbc.  

(Disclaimer:  Just because I fixed this doesn't mean I know what I'm
doing!  (Of course, you already know this))
