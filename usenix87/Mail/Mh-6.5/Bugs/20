Subject: Bug in repl MH 6.4
Date: Thu, 02 Apr 87 17:33:50 O


Index: .../mh/uip/replsbr.c

Description:
	The repl(1) command, part of MH-6.4, dumps core on a computer
	which did not accepts nil pointers e.g. Sun. If we don't want
	the field and it is a long field so we get the state FLDPLUS.


Repeat-By:
	Use repl(1) on a Sun with a very long To list in the
	message you reply to.


Fix:
	Check if the pointer is NIL before adding any information
	to it.
