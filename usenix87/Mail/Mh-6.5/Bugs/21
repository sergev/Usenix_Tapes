Subject: Serious bug in BBoards channel
Date: Mon, 20 Apr 87 18:26:51 -0800
Message-Id: <1493.545970411@gremlin.nrtc.northrop.com>
From: Marshall Rose <gremlin.nrtc.northrop.com!mrose>

    Erik Fair and I just discovered a bug in MH's BBoards channel for
    MMDF-II.  If you are using this for BBoards distribution to remote
    sites (e.g., I am using it here for the ISO and ISODE and ARPA-MHS
    and ...  lists), then you should install this fix ASAP.  Basically,
    the return-path: field was being mangled.  I think this is also a
    bug in MMDF-II, but since mortals don't write channels, it's easier
    to fix this channel than MMDF-II ...

    These are for files in the support/bboards/mmdfII/bboards/
    directory:
