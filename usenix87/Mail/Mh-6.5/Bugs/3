Subject: Fixes for bbc -topics in a POP environment
Date: Tue, 03 Feb 87 13:41:40 EST
From: braggvax.arpa!ted

We run a pop server on our 4.3 vax, and have the Suns in our Lan configured
as pop clients.  This works great for mail, but there were some minor
problems for bboards.  In particular, the command

	bbc -topics

behaved strangely.  It would print all the bboards and the number of
messages in each, but would not list the last modified date (it does
locally on the vax).  Also, after listing all the bboards, it would go
off into the POP files and list random users' names as bboards.  To
make it work the way I think it should, I had to modify 2 files:
popser.c in support/pop and bbc.c in uip.  There was no provision for
transmitting the dates over the pop connection, so I added it at both
ends.  To fix the problem of listing pop users as bboards, I #ifdefed
out a little loop after the main bboard scan loop in popser.c.  If
someone can explain to me what this was supposed to do, and how to make
it work, I will put it back in.  You mileage may vary slightly on popser.c,
I already made one change a few months back to make anonymous pop work
at all.

There is still an intermittent problem with updating .bbrc files, but I haven't 
tracked that one down yet.

I don't claim elegance for any of this.  (Actually I don't even claim
correctness!)
