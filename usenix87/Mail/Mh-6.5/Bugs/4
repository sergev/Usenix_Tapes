Subject: Null pointer fix for msgchk in POP environment (mh 6.5)
Date: Tue, 17 Feb 87 14:19:46 EST
From: braggvax.arpa!ted

If you are configured for POP, and decide for some reason not to run POP,
msgchk will core dump on suns.  This seems to be because the "host" pointer
variable is dereferenced before it is checked for "nullness".  A fix
follows.

version: MH 6.5 #45[UCI] (nrtc-gremlin) of Tue Jul  8 11:38:00 PDT 1986
options: [ATZ] [BERK] [BSD42] [DPOP] [DUMB] [MHE] [MHRC] [OVERHEAD]
	 [RPOP] [SBACKUP='"#"'] [RPATHS] [SENDMTS] [SMTP] [POP] [BPOP]

The following fix seems to work:

------- msgchk.c -------
*** /tmp/d05306	Tue Feb 17 14:09:28 1987
--- msgchk.c	Tue Feb 17 14:07:35 1987
***************
*** 166,172 ****
  /*  */
  
  #ifdef	POP
!     if (!*host)
  	host = NULL;
      if (!host || !rpop)
  	(void) setuid (getuid ());
--- 166,172 ----
  /*  */
  
  #ifdef	POP
!     if (host && !*host)
  	host = NULL;
      if (!host || !rpop)
  	(void) setuid (getuid ());
