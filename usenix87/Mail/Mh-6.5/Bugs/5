Subject: .mh_profile bug

As has been reported before, the new version of MH (6.5) has the following
bug:  if your .mh_profile does not end with a newline, all MH commands hang
forever.

This version has just been released to W20, with the bug still in it, and
users are already getting burned.  This bug is very debilitating:  until
the users can find a consultant, they are unable to use MH at all -- they
can't read their mail, write letters, or anything.  Since this bug was not
present in the previous version of MH, it's almost impossible for the users
to figure out what's gone wrong -- they don't think to look at their
.mh_profile when they haven't changed it in months.

If possible, it would be great to get this bug fixed and out into the clusters.
Thanks!

	-- Eric
