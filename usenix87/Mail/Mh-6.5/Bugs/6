Subject: Pidwait probably should not ignore SIGHUP
Date: Wed, 25 Feb 87 13:40:32 EST
From: braggvax.arpa!ted


We have a large number of users who have come to Unix (Vax 4.3 BSD) from
systems where the end of file character is ^Z.  Despite many reminders,
there are always some who use ^Z in the prompter to end a message.
Since we have job control bound to ^Z, this results in the prompter
being suspended.  It is not uncommon for users to have 2 or 3 suspended
prompters.  When they try to logout, they get the message from the
shell saying they have stopped jobs and just hang up the modem or turn
off the terminal.

This results in SIGHUP being sent to all their processes, letting them
clean up and exit.  Unfortunately, when comp calls pidwait() to wait
for the prompter to exit, it ignores SIGHUP.  This causes stopped ('T'
state) prompters and sleeping comps to gradually build up over time
even after the user is logged out (and these actually seem to sometimes
do funny things to the tty ports they are associated with).

I tried to think of anytime in normal use when you really would want
comp not to exit when sent a SIGHUP and couldn't, so I made the following
change to pidwait.c in sbr/pidwait.c :
