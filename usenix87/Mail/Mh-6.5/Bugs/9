MH still does not work on a Gould (even with release 2.0, sigh).

The problem is in the C compiler; it cannot compile the the time and
date parser (zotnet/tws/dtimep.{lex,c} ) correctly.  I haven't found
any fixes, and Gould, as far as I know, has not looked into the
problem.  I just heard from a friend of mine at Gould minutes ago.  It
seems he tried to compile MH and it *didn't* *work*.  Perhaps he'll get
the ball rolling.

Anyone want to write a C-based date parser?
