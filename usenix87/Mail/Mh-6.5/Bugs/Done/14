Subject: HP-UX/Sys5 patch #2 of N for mh-6.5

Here's the next round of patches to mh-6.5 for HP-UX System V systems. 
The next 6 patches (2-7) grab the right directory-access routines out
of <ndir.h>; if you #define NDIR, your system can get them too.  (You
might need to put "ldoptlibs -lndir" in your conf/MH file; HP-UX 5.0
puts the new directory-accessing routines directly in the defaultly-
searched C library so you don't have to call -lndir explicitly.)

Recall that patch #1, sent last week, was the fix to miscellany/less
to do the right thing for terminals with the "xs" standout mode glitch.
And now, on with the show.


In sbr/m_gmsg.c, <sys/dir.h> is included for SYS5 systems.  Some
machines like HP-UX are SYS5 yet prefer <ndir.h> for directory-access. 

With the following patch, HP-UX systems will automatically configure
themselves correctly; other SYS5 systems should #define NDIR if they
want <ndir.h>.  [The NDIR define takes precedence over SYS5 or BSD42,
although if you have BSD42 defined, you don't need or get <ndir.h>.]
After installing this patch, you can force the use of <ndir.h> by
adding "options NDIR" to your conf/MH file. 

To install:
	patch -p -d $MH_SOURCE < this-file-here
