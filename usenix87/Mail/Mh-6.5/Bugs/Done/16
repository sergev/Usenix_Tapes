    Well, it took a very long time, but I found the bug.  If you have
    both the /smtp suffix enabled for the MTS (e.g., sendmail/smtp) and
    the BERK option enabled, then they kill each other.  The fix is to
    use either but not both.  If you want the BERK option, then you'd
    better be using SendMail.  If you want the SMTP option, then you'd
    better not use the BERK option.  Here's a quick diff to the file
    conf/mhconfig.c which will enforce this policy.
