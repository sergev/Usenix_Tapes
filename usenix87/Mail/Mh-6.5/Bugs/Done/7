Subject: mh-6.5 fix 1 of N, for small values of N: the less program

Here's the first of a few fixes to mh-6.5 to make it run better on
HP-UX.  Well, actually, the first fix is to the less program, which is
distributed in miscellany/less/*. 

PROBLEM:
The less program doesn't successfully sweep the standout-mode dirt left
by its prompt on HP terminals, which leads to misleading screens.

REPEAT-BY:
Run less on a terminal that has the termcap "xs" glitch (standout mode
isn't erased by writing over it).  Grab any HP terminal, for example. 
Get a couple of screensful down into the file.  Type the `u' command,
then type a space.  Notice that where the prompt used to be is still in
standout mode, which means some of your file's text is now in standout
mode.  Rather annoying.

FIX:
Run the following lines, or all of this message, through the following
[k]sh commands, customizing the first line as necessary:

	$ MH_SOURCE_DIR=/usr/local/src/mh-6.5	# or wherever
	$ patch -p -d $MH_SOURCE_DIR < this-file-here
