\fIDist\fR is similar to \fIforw\fR.
It prepares the specified
message for redistribution to addresses that (presumably) are
not on the original address list.

The default message form contains the following elements:

.nf
.in +.5i
.ne 10
.eo
.so @(MHETCPATH)/distcomps
.ec
.in -.5i
.fi

If the file named \*(lqdistcomps\*(rq exists in the user's MH directory,
it will be used instead of this form.
In either case, the file specified by `\-form\ formfile' will be
used if given.
The form used will be prepended to the message being resent.

If the draft already exists,
\fIdist\fR will ask you as to the disposition of the draft.
A reply of \fBquit\fR will abort \fIdist\fR, leaving the draft intact;
\fBreplace\fR will replace the existing draft with a blank skeleton;
and \fBlist\fR will display the draft.

Only those addresses in \*(lqResent\-To:\*(rq, \*(lqResent\-cc:\*(rq, and
\*(lqResent\-Bcc:\*(rq will be sent.
Also, a \*(lqResent\-Fcc:\ folder\*(rq will be honored (see \fIsend\fR\0(1)).
Note that with \fIdist\fR, the draft should contain only 
\*(lqResent\-xxx:\*(rq fields and no body.
The headers and the body of the original message are copied to the draft when
the message is sent.
Use care in constructing the headers for the redistribution.

If the `\-annotate' switch is given, the  message being
distributed will be annotated with the lines:

     Resent:\ date
     Resent:\ addrs

where each address list contains as many lines as required.
This annotation
will be done only if the message is sent directly from \fIdist\fR.
If the message is not sent immediately from \fIdist\fR,
\*(lqcomp \-use\*(rq may be used to re\-edit and send the constructed message,
but the annotations won't take place.
The '\-inplace' switch causes annotation to
be done in place in order to preserve links to the annotated message.

See \fIcomp\fR\0(1) for a description of the `\-editor' and `\-noedit'
switches.
Note that while in the editor,
the message being resent is available through a link named \*(lq@\*(rq
(assuming the default \fIwhatnowproc\fR\0).
In addition, the actual pathname of the message is stored in the envariable
\fB$editalt\fR,
and the pathname of the folder containing the message is stored in the
envariable \fB$mhfolder\fR.

The `\-draftfolder\ +folder' and `\-draftmessage\ msg' switches invoke the
\fIMH\fR draft folder facility.
This is an advanced (and highly useful) feature.
Consult the \fBAdvanced Features\fR section of the \fIMH\fR manual for more
information.

Upon exiting from the editor,
\fIdist\fR will invoke the \fIwhatnow\fR program.
See \fIwhatnow\fR\0(1) for a discussion of available options.
The invocation of this program can be inhibited by using the `\-nowhatnowproc'
switch.
(In truth of fact,
it is the \fIwhatnow\fR program which starts the initial edit.
Hence, `\-nowhatnowproc' will prevent any edit from occurring.)

.Hi
\fIDist\fR originally used headers of the form \*(lqDistribute\-xxx:\*(rq
instead of \*(lqResent\-xxx:\*(rq.  In order to conform with the
ARPA Internet standard, RFC\-822,
the \*(lqResent\-xxx:\*(rq form is now used.
\fIDist\fR will recognize \*(lqDistribute\-xxx:\*(rq type headers and 
automatically convert them to \*(lqResent\-xxx:\*(rq.
.Bu
\fIDist\fR does not \fIrigorously\fR check the message being
distributed for adherence to the transport standard,
but \fIpost\fR called by \fIsend\fR does.
The \fIpost\fR program will balk (and rightly so) at poorly formatted messages,
and \fIdist\fR won't correct things for you.

If \fIwhatnowproc\fR is \fIwhatnow\fR,
then \fIdist\fR uses a built\-in \fIwhatnow\fR,
it does not actually run the \fIwhatnow\fR program.
Hence, if you define your own \fIwhatnowproc\fR,
don't call it \fIwhatnow\fR since \fIdist\fR won't run it.

If your current working directory is not writable,
the link named \*(lq@\*(rq is not available.
