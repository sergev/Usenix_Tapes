\fIDp\fR is a program that parses dates according to the ARPA Internet
standard.
It also understands many non\-standard formats,
such as those produced by TOPS\-20 sites and some UNIX sites using
\fIctime\fR\0(3).
It is useful for seeing how \fIMH\fR will interpret a date.

The \fIdp\fR program treats each argument as a single date,
and prints the date out in the official 822\-format.
Hence, it is usually best to enclose each argument in double\-quotes for the
shell.

To override the output format used by \fIdp\fR,
the `\-format\ string' or `\-format\ file' switches are used.
This permits individual fields of the address to be extracted with ease.
The string is simply a format stringand thefile is simply a format file.
See \fImh\-format\fR\0(5) for the details.

Here is the default format string used by \fIdp\fR:

.ti +.5i
%<(nodate{text})error: %{text}%|%(putstr(pretty{text}))%>

which says that if an error was detected, print the error, a `:',
and the date in error.
Otherwise, output the 822\-proper format of the date.

The argument to the `\-format' switch must be interpreted as a single token
by the shell that invokes \fIdp\fR.
Therefore,
one must usually place the argument to this switch inside double\-quotes.
