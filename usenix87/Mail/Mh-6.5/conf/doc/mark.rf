The \fImark\fR command manipulates message sequences by adding or
deleting message numbers from folder\-specific message sequences,
or by listing those sequences and messages.
A message sequence is a keyword, just like one of the
\*(lqreserved\*(rq message names,
such as \*(lqfirst\*(rq or \*(lqnext\*(rq.
Unlike the \*(lqreserved\*(rq message names,
which have a fixed semantics on a per\-folder basis,
the semantics of a message sequence may be defined, modified, and
removed by the user.
Message sequences are folder\-specific, e.g.,
the sequence name \*(lqseen\*(rq in the context of folder \*(lq+inbox\*(rq
need not have any relation whatsoever to the sequence of the same name
in a folder of a different name.

Three action switches direct the operation of \fImark\fR.
These switches are mutually exclusive:
the last occurrence of any of them overrides any previous occurrence of the
other two.

The `\-add' switch tells \fImark\fR to add messages to sequences
or to create a new sequence.
For each sequence named via the `\-sequence\ name' argument
(which must occur at least once)
the messages named via `msgs'
(which defaults to \*(lqcur\*(rq if no `msgs' are given),
are added to the sequence.
The messages to be added need not be absent from the sequence.
If the `\-zero' switch is specified,
the sequence will be emptied prior to adding the messages.
Hence, `\-add\ \-zero' means that each sequence should be initialized
to the indicated messages,
while `\-add\ \-nozero' means that each sequence should be appended to
by the indicated messages.

The `\-delete' switch tells \fImark\fR to delete messages from
sequences, and is the dual of `\-add'.
For each of the named sequences,
the named messages are removed from the sequence.
These messages need not be already present in the sequence.
If the `\-zero' switch is specified,
then all messages in the folder are appended to the sequence prior to
removing the messages.
Hence, `\-delete\ \-zero' means that each sequence should contain all
messages except those indicated,
while `\-delete\ \-nozero' means that only the indicated messages
should be removed from each sequence.
As expected, the command `mark\0\-sequence\0seen\0\-delete\0all'
deletes the sequence \*(lqseen\*(rq from the current folder.

When creating (or modifying) a sequence,
the `\-public' switch indicates that the sequence should be made readable
for other \fIMH\fR users.
In contrast, the `\-nopublic' switch indicates that the sequence should be
private to the user's \fIMH\fR environment.

The `\-list' switch tells \fImark\fR to list both the sequences defined
for the folder and the messages associated with those sequences.
\fIMark\fR will list each sequence named via `\-sequence\ name'
(or all of them if `\-sequence' isn't used),
and the messages associated with that sequence.
The `\-zero' switch does not affect the operation of `\-list'.

The current restrictions on sequences are:

.in +.25i
The name used to denote a message sequence must consist solely of
alphabetic characters, and can not be one of the \*(lqreserved\*(rq
message names
(e.g., \*(lqfirst\*(rq, \*(lqcur\*(rq, and so forth).

Only a certain number of sequences may be defined for a given folder.
This number is usually limited to 10.

The name used to denote a message sequence can not occur as part of a
message range, e.g., constructs like \*(lqseen:20\*(rq or
\*(lqseen\-10\*(rq are forbidden.
