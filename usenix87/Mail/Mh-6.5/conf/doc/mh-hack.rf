This is a description of how one can modify the \fIMH\fR system.
The \fIMH\fR distribution has a lot of complex inter\-relations,
so before you go modifying any code, you should read this and
understand what is going on.

\fBADDING A NEW PROGRAM\fR
.br
Suppose you want to create a new \fIMH\fR command called
\*(lqpickle\*(rq.
First, create and edit \*(lqpickle.c\*(rq in the \fBuip/\fR directory.
Next edit \fBconf/makefiles/uip\fR to include \*(lqpickle\*(rq.
This file has directions at the end of it which explain how it should
be modified.
Next, update any documentation (described below).
At this point you can re\-configure \fIMH\fR.
See \fImh\-gen(8)\fR for instructions on how to do this
(basically, you want \*(lqmhconfig MH\*(rq).

\fBADDING A NEW SUBROUTINE\fR
.br
Suppose you want to create a new \fIMH\fR routine called
\*(lqpickle\*(rq.
First, create and edit \*(lqpickle.c\*(rq in the \fBsbr/\fR directory.
Next edit \fBconf/makefiles/sbr\fR to include \*(lqpickle\*(rq.
This file has directions at the end of it which explain how it should
be modified.
You should modify \fBconfig/mh.h\fR to define \*(lqpickle ();\*(rq.
Similarly, \fBsbr/llib\-lsbr\fR should be modified for \fIlint\fR.
At this point you can re\-configure \fIMH\fR.

.ti -.5i
\fBUPDATING DOCUMENTATION\fR
.br
Edit whatever files you want in \fBconf/doc/\fR.
When documenting a new program, such as \*(lqpickle\*(rq,
you should create a manual page with the name \*(lqpickle.rf\*(rq.
The file \fBconf/doc/template\fR has a manual page template that you
can use.
If you are documenting a new program, then you should also update three
other files:
The file \fBconf/doc/mh.rf\fR should be modified to include the
\*(lq\&.NA\*(rq section from \*(lqpickle.rf\*(rq.
The file \fBconf/doc/mh\-chart.rf\fR should be modified to include
the \*(lq\&.SY\*(rq section from \*(lqpickle.rf\*(rq.
Finally, the file \fBconf/doc/MH.rf\fR should be modified to include a
\*(lq\&.so pickle.me\*(rq.
Naturally, none of these changes will be reflected in the configuration
until you actually run \fImhconfig\fR.

Hacking is an art, but most programmers are butchers, not artists.
