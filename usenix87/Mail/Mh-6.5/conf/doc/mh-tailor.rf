@(MHETCPATH)/mtstailor \- system customization for MH message system
.SY
any \fIMH\fR command that interacts with the MTS
.DE
The file @(MHETCPATH)/mtstailor defines run\-time options for those \fIMH\fR
programs which interact (in some form) with the message transport system.
At present, these (user) programs are:
\fIap\fR, \fIconflict\fR, \fIinc\fR, \fImsgchk\fR,
\fImsh\fR, \fIpost\fR, \fIrcvdist\fR, and \fIrcvpack\fR.

The options available along with default values and a description of their
meanings are listed below:

.in +.5i
.ti -.5i
localname:
.br
The host name \fIMH\fR considers local.
If not set, depending on the version of UNIX you're running,
\fIMH\fR will query the system for this value
(e.g., <whoami.h>, gethostname, etc.).
@BEGIN: POP
POP client hosts have this value set to the name of the POP service host.
@END: POP
This has no equivalent in the \fIMH\fR configuration file.

.ti -.5i
systemname:
.br
The name of the local host in the \fIUUCP\fR \*(lqdomain\*(rq.
If not set, depending on the version of UNIX you're running,
\fIMH\fR will query the system for this value.
This has no equivalent in the \fIMH\fR configuration file.
@BEGIN: MF

.ti -.5i
uucpchan: name of \fIUUCP\fR channel
.br
Usually \*(lqUUCP\*(rq.
This has no equivalent in the \fIMH\fR configuration file.
@END: MF

.ti -.5i
mmdfldir: @(MHDROPATH)
.br
The directory where maildrops are kept.
If this is empty, the user's home directory is used.
This overrides the \*(lqmail\*(rq field in the \fIMH\fR configuration file.

.ti -.5i
mmdflfil: @(MHDROPFIL)
.br
The name of the maildrop file in the directory where maildrops are kept.
If this is empty, the user's login name is used.
This overrides the \*(lqmail\*(rq field in the \fIMH\fR configuration file.
@BEGIN: MF

.ti -.5i
uucpldir: /usr/spool/mail
.br
The name of the directory where \fIUUCP\fR maildrops are kept.
This has no equivalent in the \fIMH\fR configuration file.

.ti -.5i
uucplfil:
.br
The name of the maildrop file in the directory where \fIUUCP\fR maildrops are
kept.
If this is empty, the user's login name is used.
This has no equivalent in the \fIMH\fR configuration file.
@END: MF

.ti -.5i
mmdelim1: \\001\\001\\001\\001\\n
.br
The beginning\-of\-message delimiter for maildrops.

.ti -.5i

.ti -.5i
mmailid: 0
.br
If non-zero, then support for MMailids in \fB/etc/passwd\fR is enabled.
Basically, the pw_gecos field in the password file is of the form

.ti +.5i
My Full Name <mailid>

The \fIMH\fR internal routines that deal with user and full names will return
\*(lqmailid\*(rq and \*(lqMy Full Name\*(rq respectively.
@BEGIN: MF

.ti -.5i
umincproc: @(MHETCPATH)/uminc
.br
The path to the program that filters \fIUUCP\fR\-style maildrops to
\fIMMDF\fR\-style maildrops.
@END: MF

.ti -.5i
lockstyle: 0
.br
The locking\-discipline to perform.
A value of \*(lq0\*(rq means to use \fIflock\fR if available,
standard \fIBellMail\fR locking otherwise.
A value of \*(lq1\*(rq means to use \fIBellMail\fR locking always
(the name of the lock is based on the file name).
A value of \*(lq2\*(rq means to use \fIMMDF\fR locking always
(the name of the lock is based on device/inode pairs).

.ti -.5i
lockldir:
.br

If your system doesn't have the \fIflock\fR syscall,
then this directory is used when creating locks.
If the value is empty,
then the directory of the file to be locked is used.

@END: MHMTS
@BEGIN: SMTP

.ti -.5i
hostable: @(MHETCPATH)/hosts
.br
The exceptions file for /etc/hosts used by \fIpost\fR to try to find official
names.
The format of this file is quite simple:

.in +.5i
1. Comments are surrounded by sharp (`#') and newline.
.br
2. Words are surrounded by whitespace.
.br
3. The first word on the line is the official name of a host.
.br
4. All words following the official names are aliases for that host.
.in -.5i

.ti -.5i
servers: localhost \\01localnet
.br
A lists of hosts and networks which to look for SMTP servers
when posting local mail.
It turns out this is a major win for hosts which don't run an message
transport system.
The value of \*(lqservers\*(rq should be one or more items.
Each item is the name of either a host or a net
(in the latter case, precede the name of the net by a \\01).
This list is searched when looking for a smtp server to post mail.
If a host is present, the SMTP port on that host is tried.
If a net is present,
the SMTP port on each host in that net is tried.
Note that if you are running with the BIND code,
then any networks specified are ignored
(sorry, the interface went away under BIND).
@END: SMTP
@BEGIN: SENDMTS

.ti -.5i
sendmail: /usr/lib/sendmail
.br
The pathname to the \fIsendmail\fR program.
@END: SENDMTS
@BEGIN: POP

.ti -.5i
pophost:
.br
The name of the default POP service host.
If this is not set,
then \fIMH\fR looks in the standard maildrop areas for waiting mail,
otherwise the named POP service host is consulted.
@END: POP
@BEGIN: BBOARDS

.ti -.5i
bbdomain:
.br
The local BBoards domain (a UCI hack).
@END: BBOARDS
@BEGIN: BPOP

.ti -.5i
popbbhost
.br
The POP service host which also acts as a BBoard server.
This variable should be set on the POP BBoards client host.

.ti -.5i
popbbuser
.br
The guest account on the POP/BB service host.
This should be a different login ID than either the POP user or the BBoards
user.
(The user\-id \*(lqftp\*(rq is highly recommended.)
This variable should be set on both the POP BBoards client and service hosts.

.ti -.5i
popbblist: @(MHETCPATH)/hosts.popbb
.br
A file containing of lists of hosts that are allowed to use the POP facility
to access BBoards using the guest account.
If this file is not present,
then no check is made.
This variable should be set on the POP BBoards service host.
@END: BPOP

.ti -.5i
maildelivery: @(MHETCPATH)/maildelivery
.br
The name of the system\-wide default \fI\&.maildelivery\fR file.
See \fImhook\fR\0(1) for the details.

.ti -.5i
everyone: 200
.br
The highest user\-id which should NOT receive mail addressed to
\*(lqeveryone\*(rq.

.ti -.5i
noshell: 
.br
If set, then each user-id greater than \*(lqeveryone\*(rq
that has a login shell equivalent to the given value (e.g.,
\*(lq/bin/csh\*(rq)
indicates that mail for \*(lqeveryone\*(rq should not be sent to them.
This is useful for handling admin, dummy, and guest logins.
.in -.5i

A few words on locking:
\fIMH\fR has a flexible locking system for making locks on files.
There are two \fBmtstailor\fR variables you should be aware of
\*(lqlockstyle\*(rq and \*(lqlockldir\*(rq.
The first controls the method of locking,
the second says where lock files should be created.
The \*(lqlockstyle\*(rq variable can take on three values: 0, 1, 2.
A value of 0 says to use the flock syscall if you're running on 4.2BSD,
(otherwise use a locking style of 1).
A value of 1 or 2 specifies that a file should be created whose existance
means \*(lqlocked\*(rq and whose non\-existence means \*(lqunlocked\*(rq.
A value of 1 says to construct the lockname by appending \*(lq.lock\*(rq to
the name of the file being locked.
A value of 2 says to construct the lockname by looking at the device and
inode numbers of the file being locked.
If the \*(lqlockldir\*(rq variable is not specified,
lock files will be created in the directory where the file being locked
resides.
Otherwise, lock files will be created in the directory specified by
\*(lqlockldir\*(rq.
Prior to installing \fIMH\fR,
you should see how locking is done at your site,
and set the appropriate values.
