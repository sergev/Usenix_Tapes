The \fImsgchk\fR program checks all known mail drops for mail waiting
for you to receive.
For those drops which have mail for you,
\fImsgchk\fR will indicate if it believes that you have seen the mail
in question before.
@BEGIN: POP

If the local host is configured as a POP client,
or if the `\-host\ host' switch is given,
\fImsgchk\fR will query the POP service host as to the status of mail waiting.
The `\-user\ user' switch may be given to specify the name of the POP
subscriber you wish to check mail for on the POP service host.
The `\-rpop' switch uses the UNIX \fIrPOP\fR
(authentication done via trusted connections).
In contrast, the `\-norpop' switch uses the ARPA \fIPOP\fR
(in which case \fImsgchk\fR will prompt for a password).
