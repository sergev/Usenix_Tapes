For \fIMMDF\-II\fR, the POP channel delivers mail to the POP spool area for
later retrieval by POP subscribers.
For \fISendMail\fR, the SPOP mailer performs this task.

For each address given,
these programs consult the \fIpop\fR\0(5) file to obtain information
about the POP\-subscriber named by the address.
The programs then deliver the message to the spool area for the
POP\-subscriber.
