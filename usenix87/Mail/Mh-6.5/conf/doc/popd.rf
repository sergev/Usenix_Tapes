The \fIpopd\fR server implements the Post Office protocol,
as described in RFC819 (revised, \fIMH\fR internal).
Basically, the server listens on TCP port 109 for connections and enters the
POP upon establishing a connection.
The `\-p' option overrides the default TCP port.

.Hi
Previous versions of the server (10/28/84) had the restriction that
the POP client may retrieve messages for login users only.
This restriction has been lifted,
and true POB support is available
(sending mail to a mailbox on the POP service host
which does not map to a user\-id in the password file).
