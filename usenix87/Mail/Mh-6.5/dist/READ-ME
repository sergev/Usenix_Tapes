    If you make all the documentation in one batch, you might find that
    the TeX output lacks figures/diagrams/tables.  This is apparently
    due to a bug in make in which it fails to close down file
    descriptors on an exec.  Although it's tedious, it may just be
    easier to type:

	make realwork.dvi trusted.dvi tutorial.dvi
	make all

    instead of just

	make
