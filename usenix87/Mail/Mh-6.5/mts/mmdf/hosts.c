/* 
 * We really should be careful with the number of fd's that this routine
 * opens:  the ch_seq ch_table.c module likes to keep 6 (yes, SIX) fds around
 * to speed-up host lookups in the channel table.  Unfortunately, after all
 * of them get opened, six are always open (ch_table may close one to open
 * another).  The bottom line is that if repl calls post, then we get 12
 * (yes, TWELVE) fds open, with only six usable.
 *
 * send will close all fds >= 3 prior to invoking post.  It would be nice
 * if one could control ch_seq's use of fds for table lookups, but such is
 * life.
