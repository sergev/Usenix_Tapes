{\rightskip=0pt\narrower\narrower
\noindent
This document discusses how to process BBoards using the Rand \MH/ system.
In particular,
this guide discusses:
checking the status of a BBoard,
viewing new messages,
archive handling,
composing mail destined for a BBoard,
and replying to a message posted to a BBoard.

Although this document is based on the standard \MH/ user manual\cite{MH},
this document is meant to supplement, not supersede,
that lengthier work.

Comments concerning this documentation should be addressed to the Internet
mailbox {\tx Bug-MH@UCI.ARPA}.
