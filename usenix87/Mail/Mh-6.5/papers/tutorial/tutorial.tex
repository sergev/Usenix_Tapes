\noindent
This document introduces the UCI version of the Rand \MH/ system to novice
users.
In particular, this tutorial discusses
how to read, send, reply to, and review mail;
aspects of the \MH/ user profile affecting these activities;
and other reference works on \MH/.

Although this document is based on the standard \MH/ user
manual\cite{MRose85a},
this document is meant to supplement, not supersede,
that lengthier work.

Comments concerning this documentation should be addressed to the Internet
mailbox {\tx Bug-MH@UCI.ARPA}.
