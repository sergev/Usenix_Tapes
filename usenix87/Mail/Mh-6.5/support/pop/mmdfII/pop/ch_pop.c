/*
 *	This is the channel that is used to handle Internet BBoard
 *	distribution in an intelligent fashion.  In order to run it, you
 *	need the UCI BBoards facility installed.  This requires the
 *	establishment of a special login called ``bboards'', and the
 *	getbbent() package.
 *
 *	The idea is simple.  Distribution lists get aliased to go through
 *	this channel.  Suppose that the relay (or site) using ch_bboards
 *	subscribes to UNIX-WIZARDS.  The maintainer of the list is given
 *	the address ``dist-unix-wizards'' to send to for this relay and all
 *	sites that it serves.  The site manager then defines the following
 *	alias in the aliases file:
 *
 *		dist-unix-wizards:	unix-wizards@bboards
 *
 *	This channel (and this channel alone) is then defined to serve the
 *	``bboards'' host.  When it gets invoked, the channel does two
 *	things:  First, if the relay itself subscribes to the BBoard (the
 *	bb_file entry in the BBoards file is non-empty), then it delivers
 *	the message to the file.  Second, if other sites subscribe to the
 *	BBoard, then ch_bboards will enter the message back into the queue
 *	system using the ``bboards'' login as the sender.
 *
 *	This achieves two goals:  first, the incoming bandwidth of relays
 *	is not degraded by many sites subscribing to the same BBoard;
 *	second, if an address goes bad down the line, the relay's
 *	``bboards'' login gets the message back (not the originator).  Since
 *	the relay's PostMaster is assumed to monitor this mailbox, problems
 *	can be found and corrected.
 *
 *	Finally, ch_bboards can be run by a site that does not relay for
 *	other sites.  In this case, the bb_dist field is empty.
 */

/* 	Unlike previous versions of ch_bboards, this version does not change
 *	the contents of the headers of the message being re-distributed.
 *	The following changes are made:
 *
 *	    Envelope:	The failure address is changed to bboards@locname
 *	    Headers:	Another Received: is added
 *
 *	The local copy going to the BBoard has two entries prepended to the
 *	headers:
 *
 *	    BBoard-ID: n
 *	    BB-Posted: RFC822 date/time
 */

#else	POP

/* 
 *	The POP channel is a subset of the BBoards channel, and just
 *	handles local mail delivery for remote users.  As such, it
 *	only needs to know how to store a maildrop locally, and doesn't
 *	have to mess around with .cnt files and remote delivery.
