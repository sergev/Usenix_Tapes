I had occasion to use a Pixel/80 a few weeks ago; their mailer is a variant
of Berkmail, and is buggier than a roach motel.  So, it being that necessity
is the mother of invention, I wrote this little beastie.  Someone else may
find it handy, especially on a run-time system without a compiler (Altos
Xenix, if you don't buy the development system).

Cut at the dotted line.  This is NOT a sharchive!
