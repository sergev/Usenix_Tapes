Here is a program to make your paths file (from pathalias) smaller
by removing redundant entries.  I wrote it because we currently
create two different paths files for the systems in our domain.
Most systems get a file containing only the hosts within the domain,
while the domain gateway(s) get the full database distributed in
the newsgroups mod.map and ncr.maps.  The large paths file is too
large (~500k) to want to ship all over.  Pathprune can often remove
enough of a paths file to make transmission of it using uucp feasible.


The two tables here show the actual compression on two different systems,
with the pathalias entries broken down into three types:
	gateway		domain gateway entry (starts with a '.')
	domain		host belongs to a domain (host has a '.' in it)
	host		simple host name (in the .uucp domain)

The numbers listed are the number of lines and percentage of original
lines.  The "domain" values are slightly skewed because Berkeley lists
344 hosts in the berkeley.edu domain without any domain gateway.

for ncr-sd (domain gateway)
            orig        -v              -vt             -vut
gateway      199     128  0.64       124  0.62       124  0.62
domain      1540     652  0.42       652  0.42       652  0.42
host        8515    8515  1.00      8515  1.00      8515  1.00
total      10254    9295  0.91      9291  0.91      9291  0.91

for se-sd (internal node)
            orig        -v              -vt             -vut
gateway      199     124  0.62       120  0.60       120  0.60
domain      1540     623  0.40       623  0.40       623  0.40
host        8515    8515  1.00      8515  1.00         2  0.00
total      10254    9262  0.90      9258  0.90       745  0.07


The program will compile under both SYSV and BSD4.2, and will
should also compile under V7.  See the beginning of the source
file for compilation instructions.  It does use getopt(3).
