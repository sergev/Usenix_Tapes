Archive-name: paths.mk

The following is a shell archive containing a Makefile and sample data
files for creating a paths file suitable for smail and other UUCP-domain
routing programs.

Also included is the patch to smail that I posted to net.sources.
The patch allows the specification of a site to send any mail
that you can't route.

This package assumes that you have pathalias, makedb (part of the pathalias
distribution) and the compress utilities running on your system.  If you
are not using makedb or the compress utilities, you will need to edit
the Makefile to remove references to these programs.

If you are running uuhosts to unbatch USENET map files, you will need to
modify it to use the Makefile given here to create paths file.  This
makefile will run uuwhere, to create the paths file annotated by location.
If you don't use this or have the uuwhere program somewhere other than
where we have it on our system, you will need to modify the Makefile.
