Since I saw a request for this on Unix-Wizards and someone asked me for
it, I thought I would send it here for others who may be interested.

The following shell archive contains context diffs that support the
SMTP send command.  These diffs were extracted from the 4.3beta
sendmail and extraneous patches removed, so don't believe the line
numbers at all.

The only change to the configuration files is in localm.m4 where a TTY
mailer needs to be defined. I included an example as localm.m4.

Also included is the program we use to send messages, to.  It is a
simple program that was originally written by Stuart Cracraft.  I
hacked it up to use Sendmail/SMTP.  It isn't much but it will deliver
tty messages.

This code has been in use here at Stanford for over a year.  It is
known to work with the TOPS-20 implementation for sending and receiving
messages.

If anyone makes any changes to these things, I would appreciate it if
you could send them back to me.  I have always wanted to add a reply
command and "what are the last N messages" command, but have never
found the time.  Manual pages are needed too.

Enjoy!
