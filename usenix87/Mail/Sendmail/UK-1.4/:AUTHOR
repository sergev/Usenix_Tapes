I've had a number of requests for this, since I announced it in net.mail

So, I'm sending it in 3 shar archives to mod.sources.  One warning:
Some of the shell scripts I use are BSD specific.  (E.g. I use "cat -n"
and "fmt" in places.)  I assumed that most people who have sendmail
are running 4.xBSD.
