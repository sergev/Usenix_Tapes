Sendmail Configuration Package UK-1.4
======== ============= ======= ======

Overview
--------
This package provides you with tools to generates a fully domain based
sendmail configuration file from domain and channel tables in a format
similar to that used by MMDF.

The configuration essentially comprises of three parts: the domain tables,
the channel tables and the mailer specifications.  The following diagram
shows how all three pieces fit together.

                                             -----------   [  mailer,  ]
                                             | channel |-->[   host,   ]
             ----------  fully qualified    /| tables  |   [ transport ]
incoming     | domain |  domain addresses  / -----------   [ addresses ]
addresses -->| tables |--------->---------<
             ----------                    \ -----------
                                            \| mailer  |       header
                                             | specs   |---> addresses
                                             -----------

The domain tables convert addresses given to sendmail into fully qualified
domain addresses; these are then passed to the channel tables which select
the <network, host, transport address> triple required for message delivery.

The domain addresses are then passed to the mailer specifications where
they are converted to a form suitable for the mail headers for that
particular network.

Anyone who has read the Sendmail Implementation Guide should recognise
the similarity between this and the rulesets diagram.  Basically, the
domain tables  correspond to ruleset 3, the channel tables to ruleset 0
and the mailer specifications to the mailer specific rulesets.

This README will hopefully explain how to build these pieces and thus
generate a configuration file.

The package also contains a number of support programs that often provide
a better interface between mail transport protocols and sendmail than the
"standard" programs.
