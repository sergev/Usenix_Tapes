This directory contains some sendmail interface programs.

Interfaces
----------
rmail.c:
	This is a rewrite of the standard uucp -> sendmail interface program
	which just a better job of deducing the From path from the
	uucp from line(s), and also sets sendmail's $s macro.

	This replaces /bin/rmail supplied with BSD4.2.

damail.c:
	This is a rewrite of the bitnet -> sendmail interface program
	supplied with the Cornell version of the RSCS emulation package.
	This reads the from person from the From: line and sets
	sendmail's $s macro.

	This replaces /usr/lib/rscs/damail supplied with the RSCS software.

mailer.c:
	This is a janet -> sendmail interface program. This reads a
	message in JNT mail format and converts it into a form suitable
	for calling sendmail. This also sets sendmail's $s macro.

	This replaces /usr/lib/x25/mailer supplied with the York X25 software.

hhsend.c:
	This is a sendmail -> janet interface program. This reads a
	message processed by sendmail and converts it into JNT mail format,
	then calls mhhcp to send it.

	This effectively replaces the /usr/lib/x25/hhmail supplied with the
	York X25 software; the standard mail user interfaces together with
	sendmail perform the other functions provided by hhmail.
