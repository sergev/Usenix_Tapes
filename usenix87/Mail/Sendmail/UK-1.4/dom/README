General
-------
This directory contains the domain tables from which the <site>.dom
file can be generated.

The domain tables contain a set of mappings from host or site names
to full domain names. e.g.

	usc		usc.ac.uk

Note that the domain name is in RFC822 (little-endian) style with the
the top level domain rightmost.

Any address whose domain part ends in the LHS of a rule will be expanded
to the RHS,  e.g. by the rule above:

	jim@usc	      =>  jim@usc.ac.uk
	jim@vax2.usc  =>  jim@vax2.usc.ac.uk

The rule above implies that "usc" is a subdomain of "ac" and that "ac"
is a subdomain of "uk", so that "jim@usc.ac" would also get expanded.

Hostname/domain name aliases can also be included in these files; so
for example, an entry such as: 

	oldname.uucp	newname.ac.uk

means addresses like jim@oldname.uucp will be converted to jim@newname.ac.uk.


Examples
--------
The archive Examples.a contains sample domain tables.


How to make the <site>.dom file
-------------------------------

1.  Create some files containing the domain table information.
    This is best done by extracting sample domain files from Examples.a
    and editing them, if necessary, to contain the relevent data for this site.
    Uk users should be able to use uk.dom and ukuucp.dom as is.

2.  Run "MAKE site file1 file2..." to create the <site>.dom file,
    	e.g.  MAKE hwcs local.dom uk.dom

    This shell script does a lot of work so be prepared to wait!

Note
----
A list of top level domains is automatically inserted into the <site>.dom
in class "T", which currently consists of the following domains:

	uk uucp arpa csnet bitnet dec

If there are others you wish to add, then edit the <site>.dom file directly
and add these to class T.

Remember that there should be an entry in ../chn/top.chn for every top level
domain defined in class T.
