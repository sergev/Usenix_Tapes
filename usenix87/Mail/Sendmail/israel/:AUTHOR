Here are my modifications to sendmail that I announced recently.  I
am posting these due to the number of requests.  These modifications
allow translations to be used in the sendmail.cf file, such as
pathalias information and other stuff.  Run the shar in a clean
directory and then read the README.  Enjoy.
