This file documents the directory /usr/lib/hostnames that is
frequently used in sendmail.cf.  It is intended to be a README for
that directory.

This directory contains all routing tables for sendmail.  The different files
are used to route mail to different hosts on various nets.  The files are:

combined-hosts	This file contains sites that are known to be on both the
		arpanet and USEnet.  For such sites, mail is routed via
		the ARPAnet if a specific delivery method (i.e. .UUCP) is
		not specified.

csnet		This file contains the list of CSNet Phonenet sites.  It is
		in the form '<alias> <real-name>'.

cur-site	Aliases for the local site.

locals		Aliases for all local area network sites.  Lines are of
		the form '<site-alias> <real-site-name>'.

mailhosts	list of users and mailing lists on the other machines of
		the local network.  Lines are of the form:
		<name> <name>@<site>
		This file is created by the 'names' executable nightly.

relays		list of domains and an accessible host that knows how
		to relay all mail intended for that domain.  For
		example, 'csnet csnet-relay.arpa'.

specials	list of hosts that need to be specially processed, and
		the real way to get to that host.  This can be used for
		defining special, non-arpanet hosts or hosts who need
		a special path (like if a connection is broken).  Each
		line is '<site> <real-site-with-routing>'.  For example:
		if ARPASITE's arpanet connection is down indefinitely, you
		might put in: 'ARPASITE ARPASITE.uucp@ARPANEIGHBOR.uucp' and
		then mail will be routed to ARPANEIGHBOR via UUCP and then
		to ARPASITE.  Because of the purpose of this file, any
		path in here overrides all other paths (including user
		specified paths).

uucp-direct	List of sites that this site talks to directly via UUCP.

uucp-routing	List of UUCPnet sites that we know how to route to.
		Lines are of the form '<name> <route>!<name>'.
