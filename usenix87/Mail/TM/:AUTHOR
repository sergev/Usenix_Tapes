=========
Many, many times I have discovered TM files remaining in
our uucp spool directory resulting from incomplete uucp
sessions.  Moreover, a significant minority of those files
contained information that was never retransmitted, for
reasons that I cannot undestand.  I am a fanatic about not
losing data, so I wrote the following programs to make
maximum use of the incomplete TM files.  This has the
effect of sometimes duplicating mail that WAS eventually
retransmitted correctly, but my users don't mind that at
all.  Duplicate news articles are later recognized
as such.  When all the articles are retrieved from the TM
files, they can be moved to the junk directory and
processed using "process_junk" which I have posted
separately.

The files are deTM, deTMunbatch.c, and mv2junk.
deTM does not autmatically invoke mv2junk so that it can
work without having to lock the news files.  mv2junk just
has the effect of transferring deTM's results into the
junk news directory so that process_junk can get to it.
I would recommend at least reading the comments in
deTM before trying to run it.

deTM_unbatch is a C program, it was too crappy to do as a
shell script.  I would be willing to install #define's for
portability if anybody wants to contribute them.  deTM_unbatch
has the effect of breaking down a batched news file into its
constituent articles.
