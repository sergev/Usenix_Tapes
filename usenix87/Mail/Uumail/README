This is an updated version of uumail (and uupath) that can 
access a pathalias-generated database to facilitate routine mail.

These program can cope with DBM and standard line-oriented forms of 
pathalias-generated databases.

This version of uumail can be used as uupath by linking uumail to
uupath. Also, this version can handle domain addresses (user@host.domain).
You can put as many addresses on a line as you like.

This version provides an alias and forwarding facility. For details on 
aliasing see the file "Alias.Design". The forward facility is similiar to
the one in sendmail. A user may forward his mail by adding a file called
".forward" in his home directory. This file conatains the address(es) to which
mail is to be forwarded. These addresses are not reprocessed by the aliasing
subroutine, but may be in domain format (if RESOLVE is defined when you are
compiling).

There is also some experimental sections in this release that binary only
sites might like to experiment with. See the file "Binary.Only" for details on
this experiment.

There has been some confusion in the past on configuring uumail to work
with sendmail. See the file "Sendmail" for information on this.

 *    IF YOU ARE USING A DBM DATABASE, READ THIS!
 *    If the special sentinel value of @@@ is not present in the
 *    database, then getpath will assumed that the database is being
 *    rebuilt and will block for TIMEOUT (default = 180) seconds.  
 *    If, after 5 such blocks, the sentinel is not present,
 *    the error code EX_TEMPFAIL is returned.
 *    The same is true if the dbm files cannot be initialized.
 *    Please be sure to add the sentinal to the DBM database when
 *    it is created.
 *    To add the sentinel, use the "makedb" command.
 *    makedb -a dbrootname < @@@
 *    should append the sentinel to the database.
 *    makedb is part of the distribution of pathalias.

To configure uumail, type "sh Configure" and answer the questions
as best you can. You should be able to type "make" when it is 
done to build uumail.

Here are some manual alterations you may want to make by adding
these flags (in the form -Dflag) to the OPTIONS line in the Makefile.

NOGRADE should be used if your uux does not understand the -g flag.
NORETURN should be used if your uux does not understand the -a flag.

There are some other items that should be noted when configuring uumail.
In the makefile, set UUMAIL equal to the location of the uumail program
on your system FOLLOWING INSTALLATION! Set REALUUX equal to the location
of the uux program. This will be /usr/bin/uux on most systems. Binary
only site should check the "Binary.Only" file for more information on
the use of this symbol.

If you want to install this system, use "make install". If you want
to have it do all the work for incoming mail, type "make mailer". You
probably do not want to "make mailer" if you run sendmail.

A manual page for address, uumail and uupath are included.

IMPORTANT NOTE ABOUT THE PATHS DATABASE
The "palias" file supplied has routes to the known networks relative to
soma. To make this work for you, you can do one of two things:
1. Get a recent distribution of pathalias and make your own database.
OR
2. Edit the "palias" file to provide paths relative to your machine.
If you fail to do this, uumail will fail to find a usable path most
of the time.

RFC976 Compliance notes

Uumail is capable of satisfying Class 3 requirements as specified in
RFC976. It can also be compiled to satisfy Class 2 and Class 1 requirements
only. Here are the appropriate compile time flags for compliance with
with the three classes; these are only the flags necessary to make 
uumail perform in a particular class. Other flags may be needed to use
the dbm-type database and other options. It should be noted that each
higher numbered class is a superset of the lower numbered class,
so if you are a class 3 you will automatically comply with Classes 1
and 2. The following is excerpted from the RFC976 document.


   Class 1   old-style UUCP ! routing only.  We assume that the host
             understands local user names:

                  rmail user

             and bang paths

                  rmail host1!host2!user

             but we assume nothing more about the host.  If we have
             no information about a host, we can treat it as class 1
             with no problems, since we make no assumptions about
             how it will handle hybrid addresses.

COMPILE FLAGS NEED FOR THIS CLASS: none



   Class 2   Old style UUCP ! routing, and 4.2BSD style domain
             parsing.  We assume the capabilities of class 1, plus
             the ability to understand

                  rmail user@domain

             if the "domain" is one outside the UUCP zone which
             the host knows about.  Class 2 hosts do not necessarily
             understand domain!user or have routers.  Hosts in non-

             UUCP RFC-920 domains are considered class 2, even though
             they may not understand host!user.

COMPILE FLAGS NEED FOR THIS CLASS: RESOLVE

   Class 3   All class 1 and 2 features are present.  In addition,
             class 3 hosts must be able to route UUCP mail for hosts
             that are not immediately adjacent and also understand
             the syntax

                  rmail domain!user

             as described above.  All gateways into UUCP must be
             class 3.

COMPILE FLAGS NEED FOR THIS CLASS: RESOLVE

P.S. My thanks to all those who reported bugs from the previous release.
Please continue to send them in, and I will try to keep fixing them.
