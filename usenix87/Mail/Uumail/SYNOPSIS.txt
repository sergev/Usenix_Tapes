I am happy to announe the release of uumail version 4.0, the pathalias
mailer. uumail is not a user-agent. It is intended to be used as a 
"back-end" to take the mail from user-agents and correctly route it
to its destination. Other examples of similiar programs include
sendmail, delivermail, and MMDF.

Features of uumail include:
	o RFC 976 Compliant (UUCP Mail Interface Format Standard)
	o uses pathalias(1) generated database in either text or dbm(3) format
	o MH-style aliasing support
	o sendmail-like .forward processing
	o can pipe mail output into other programs (e.g. uurec)
	o can be used under SYSTEM III, SYSTEM V or BSD
	o rn-like Configuration program for easy installation
	o returns undeliverable mail
	o usable as a mailer with sendmail(8)
	o does not require unix sources to install
	o dynamically determines uucp neighbors without modification
              of the pathalias database
        o functions as uupath(1) to return paths from pathalias(1) database
        o logging of traffic supported
        o supports 4.3 BSD UUCP graded transactions

No other programs are required to use uumail. Pathalias(1) is useful for
generating a full database, but a full database is not required to make
uumail useful.

Bug reports are welcome.
