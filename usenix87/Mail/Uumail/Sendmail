You probably don't want uumail to alias things, so be sure you answer that
question correctly when running Configure. You may not want uumail to
deal with internet addresses (although it really doen't matter) as well.

Then edit the mailer definition for uucp in /usr/lib/sendmail.cf
and change the P=/usr/bin/uux to be P=[where uumail is] (e.g.
/usr/lib/uucp/uumail).
Change the A= to A=uumail -h -f$g $h!$u

This will replace the uux execution with uumail. If you do this exactly, 
you will only need the pathalias generated database to be present for
uumail to work correctly.

There are more things you can do to make sendmail be smarter about
using uumail, but in general, this is not necessary since uumail
will return informative messges to sendmail ( and the user) if 
there is a failure.

If you would like to share your problems or ideas on interfacing
sendmail and uumail, I would appreciate hearing them.

Thanks.
