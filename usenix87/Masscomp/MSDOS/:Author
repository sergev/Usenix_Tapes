				MTOOLS v1.2

This is a collection of MSDOS tools to allow you to read and write to
MSDOS formatted diskettes from your Masscomp's floppy disk drive.

YOU MUST HAVE AN IBM COMPATIBLE COMPUTER WITH A 80 TRACK DOUBLE SIDED
5.25 INCH DISKETTE AND MSDOS 3.30 FOR THIS PROGRAM TO WORK PROPERLY.

Since this is not the normal type of drive you'd find on an IBM computer,
you'll have to format it under MSDOS 3.30 using its loadable device driver
feature.  Once formatted, the diskette will be completely transportable
between your Masscomp and your IBM compatible.

The following MSDOS commands are emulated:

Mtool 		MSDOS
name		equivalent	Description
-----		----		-----------
mdel		DEL/ERASE	delete a MSDOS file
mdir		DIR		display a MSDOS directory
mmd		MD/MKDIR	make a MSDOS sub directory
mrd		RD/RMDIR	remove a MSDOS sub directory
mread		COPY		read (copy) a MSDOS file to Unix
mren		REN/RENAME	rename an existing MSDOS file
mtype		TYPE		display contents of a MSDOS file
mwrite		COPY		write (copy) a Unix file to MSDOS
*		CD		change working directory

	* by use of an environmental variable

This collection of programs was written under the 'att' universe, but the
only 'bsd' inconsistencies should be strchr/strrchr vs. index/rindex.
