.TH MREN 1 local
.SH NAME
mren \- rename an existing MSDOS file
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B mren sourcefile targetfile
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Mren
renames an existing file on a MSDOS formatted diskette.  Sub directories are
supported with either the '/' or '\e\' separator.  The use of the '\e\'
separator or wildcards will require the names to be enclosed in quotes to
protect them from the shell.
.PP
Reasonable care is taken to create a valid MSDOS filename.  If an invalid
MSDOS target name is specified,
.I mren
will change the name and prompt the user to accept or reject the new name.
.PP
The path component of the target filename (if supplied) is ignored.  In
other words, you may not use
.I mren
to move a file from one sub directory to another.
.PP 
.I Mren
may also be used to rename directories.
.PP
The environmental variable MCWD may be used to establish a current
working directory (relative to the MSDOS diskette).
