				MTOOLS v1.2

This is a collection of MSDOS tools to allow you to read and write to
MSDOS formatted diskettes from a Unix based system.

The following MSDOS commands are emulated:

Mtool 		MSDOS
name		equivalent	Description
mdel		DEL/ERASE	delete a MSDOS file
mdir		DIR		display a MSDOS directory
mmd		MD/MKDIR	make a MSDOS sub directory
mrd		RD/RMDIR	remove a MSDOS sub directory
mread		COPY		read (copy) a MSDOS file to Unix
mren		REN/RENAME	rename an existing MSDOS file
mtype		TYPE		display contents of a MSDOS file
mwrite		COPY		write (copy) a Unix file to MSDOS
*		CD		change working directory

	* by use of environmental variable MCWD

The formats of IBM PC floppy disk drives are:

   bytes per  sectors per  tracks    number    total     disk   introduced
    sector      track     per side  of sides  capacity   size    in MSDOS

The Masscomp device driver for the 5.25 inch floppy disk drive (/dev/rflp)
will only read and write to an 80 track, 8 sector, double sided diskette.
This means that the device driver must be rewritten to allow for the other
formats -or- the diskette your trying to read and write must be formated on
an IBM compatible machine to meet the Masscomp's format.

Since the device driver is not normally available in source code form,
I've chosen the other approach.  Therefore, for this program to work on
your Masscomp, you must:

	1) Have a 80 track double sided 5.25 inch floppy drive for
	your IBM compatible machine. (typically less than $200)

	2) Format the 80 track floppy using MSDOS 3.30.

Assume you have an external 80 track floppy and MSDOS 3.3, you would:

	1) Add this line to your CONFIG.SYS file:

		DEVICE=DRIVER.SYS /D:2 /T:80 /S:8 /H:2 /F:2

	2) Reboot and format drive D as you would any other floppy.

Now you can read and write to the diskette (formated in drive D) in both
your IBM compatible and in your Masscomp.  All data on a standard IBM
diskette would have to be first copied over to the 80 track floppy prior
to moving it to the Masscomp.  Likewise, all data from the Masscomp would
be written to the 80 track diskette and then copied to a 40 track
diskette to be used by other IBM compatible machines.

The manuals are very terse... it's assumed that the reader is already
familiar with MSDOS.

The use of the environmental variable MCWD to keep track of the current
working directory is a little awkward, especially since there is no
'change directory' command.  Bourne shell users will have to type two
commands to first set their working directory, ie:

	MCWD=/TMP
	export MCWD

Wildcards are only applied to filenames and not to directory names.
For example '/usr/local/*.c' is appropriate, but '/usr/l*/main.c' is not.

I really wanted to avoid the use of a 'text' mode and a 'data' mode
when transferring files, but I couldn't find a better way.  It gets rather
confusing and it's quite possible to mess up a file if you apply the
text mode when it is not appropriate (ie: to a COM or EXE file).  Likewise,
if you forget to apply the text mode (to a Unix text file) then if the
file is used under MSDOS, it will be missing carriage returns.  However,
if you aren't going to use the files on your Unix system (you just
intend to hold the files and then transfer them back to MSDOS later) then
you shouldn't use the text mode during either mread or mwrite.  This is
because, the text mode is only useful if the files are gonna be used
under Unix.

Mwrite adds an EOF marker to every file (not just text files).  Mread
ignores all EOF markers.

The MSDOS 'copy' command had to be broken down into two separate Unix
commands since the MSDOS device designations (A: or C:) would be
clumsy to implement.

Mtools is also available in a 'generic' version and in a version written
especially for the AT&T Unix PC 7300.
