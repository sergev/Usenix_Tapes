Did anyone else notice that the call to fixfrom() on line 368 of inews.c
is wrong?  It should be:

				(void) fixfrom(&header);

On most systems (mine included) the given call will work fine, but only
because 'from' happens to be the first field in the header struct.

While we're at it, I know this is a nit, but it's been bothering me ever
since its first appearance in news 2.9; line 128:

	/* uuxqt doesn't close all it's files */

should be

	/* uuxqt doesn't close all its files */
