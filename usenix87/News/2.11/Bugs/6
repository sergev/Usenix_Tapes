For SYSV machines, there were a couple of bugs introduced
in PATCH #6 for news.
Problems: If you don't have F_RDLCK in <fcntrl.h>, you
don't have struct flock either. 
There was a typo in the routine to look for the history.d
directories.

These have been forwarded to rick.

Here is the diff to fix the problems.
