Here's something that might be of use to news administrators.
As far as I can tell, the news log files grow indefinitely.
Enclosed are a shell script to move the log file to an old log
file when run (I run this nightly with cron), and an awk program
to summarize a 2.10.2 form log file.  Actually, the script keeps
a series of old log files in /usr/lib/news/OLDLOGS, so you have
a little leeway in noticing a problem before the logs disappear.
Oh, one other unusual thing, the script also looks for log.unbatch
file, something I added locally to track down a specific problem.
The awk program looks for the usual
things you see in a log file and counts them, printing out 
unusual things in a separate list.
