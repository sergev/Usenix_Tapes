Those who are running SYS V with the Unix utilities on a 7300
with the 20M drive know what a tight fit it is.  This utility
when used in conjunction with expire allows frequent archiving
of the news to floppies while maintaining a Subject line
index which remains online.  It compresses the files with
the news compress utility in an attempt to get maximum density
on the floppy (but frequently the inodes run out before the
space does).

Also, recently someone sent me a request that I mail them my
version of shortc which produces a C executable which will
filter code to be unique to 7 characters via recapitalization
but it was my last day at that job and I accidently deleted
the mail message.  If he will send the request again to this address
I will be happy to mail it to him.
