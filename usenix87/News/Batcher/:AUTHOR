[  This is the second of two batched news utility programs (BNUP, to use
   an acronym).  It was written on a BSD4.3 machine, but it looks like
   it would be fairly easy to convert to USG.  Chris Lewis had posted
   this to the net shortly before he left it, and I cleaned up the
   documentation and am publishing it here.  Both this program and
   the previous one have some nice features; I look forward to the
   next one that combines the best of both methods, portably.  --r$ ]
