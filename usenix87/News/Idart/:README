This program takes a file where the first blank separated word on each
line is an article id, looks that up in the history.{dir,pag} and the
history file, and prints out the article id and file name(s) holding
that article.  The rest of the input line is ignored.

This is useful if you lose news items and want to bring your system up
to date.  You copy your feed's history file to your machine (you only
need the article id's really).  Run idart on that to find which
articles you are missing (missing or expired articles are reported on
stderr), send that list back to your news feed, and run idart on that
list again.  You can then use a simple awk script (or an editor) to
create a list of file names to be hand fed to the batching program.

This only works on those systems that are configured to use the dbm
library to access their history database.

I hope someone finds this useful.  Sorry about the lack of a manual
page.
