=========
Are you tired of just tossing all the articles in your
junk repository just because it's too much hassle to
clean 'em up?  Do you really want to make sure that
there is EVEN MORE news available to your users?

Well, then here is just the thing you need.  I have
been working on this program very sporadically for
a long time, and it seems to be pretty reliable.
You will probably want to modify certain things
about it, not least the shell variables at the tops
of the programs like $LIB, etc.  You may want to
modify it so that junk is kept around less often
than I keep it.  I have some other (less useful)
processing I do as a further stage.

The "main" program is "process_junk", which
calls "modactive" and "getnewsgps".  The latter
two programs are much less useful by themselves,
and could reasonably become C programs if speed
becomes an issue.  One general area that could
be improved is to add locking so that these scripts
could be run without disabling the news.

I don't have a shar program handy, so just separate
the programs which all three are preceded by lines
containing '='s.

I will be happy to distribute bug fixes and/or
improvements if they are sent to me.
