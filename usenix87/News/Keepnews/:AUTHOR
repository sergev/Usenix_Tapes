			     KEEPNEWS

     Keepnews is a program that attempts to provide a sane way of
     extracting and keeping information that comes over Usenet.
     The basic idea is to allow users to designate an article
     as being of some worth and then save it in a common place.
     Thus, keepnews provides an alternative to personal archival
     of news articles.  Keepnews has been in use here at the
     University of Arizona for about two years and has proven to
     be a simple and viable way of cataloging useful information
     that arrives via the net.

     Keepnews accepts a news article on standard input, analyzes
     the headers of the article and stores the article in a file.
     Articles are stored as individual files in a tree structure
     matching that of the newsgroup hierarchy.  The Article-I.D.
     is used to uniquely identify an article; each article is
     stored only once.  If an article is associated with multiple
     newsgroups, it is linked into all appropriate directories.
     Both a master log file (kept in the keepnews root directory)
     and individual group log files (kept in each group's node)
     are maintained with the relevant information regarding each
     of the archived files (newsgroups, subject, source, etc.).

     The initial version of keepnews was written in Icon by
     Bill Mitchell at the University of Arizona.  This implemen-
     tation in C was motivated by the need for greater speed and
     various functional improvements.
