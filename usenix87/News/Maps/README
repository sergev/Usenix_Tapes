The UUCP maps are automatically read from the net by uugetmaps(1L)
which is fired by the cron every 6 days.
Uugetmaps(1L) strips the news headers from the files and installs them
in the public uumap directory.

Next, uumkmk(1L) is fired (only if the previous step was ok), which
build a makefile on the fly containing the map names and invokes
pathalias(1L) to build the UUPATH database.

The user interface is the uupath(1L) program that takes input of the
form:
	machine!user
and returns the full path from the UUPATH database like:
	mach1!mach2!...!user
