I've been meaning to clean this up and post it.  It looks like I won't get
around to cleaning it up, so I'll just post it.

This program serves two useful purposes.  It rebuilds the active file,
and it produces a history file with entries for suspicious looking articles.
This can be used to clean out old news articles which for some reason
have been dropped from the history file.

Typical usage might be something like:

cp active sactive		# I have cron do this once a night
mkactive -h
mv nactive active
cat nhistory >>history
expire
