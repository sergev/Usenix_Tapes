The following shar contains a few programs that make it possible to use
MULTICAST effectively under UUCP based news transfer.  I have
submitted this to mod.sources, but I have had so many requests for
these sources, and mod.sources is so backlogged, that I am sending
this out here.  If you find any problems, please let me know ASAP.
Also, if you have to patch uucast for your particular flavor of UUCP,
please send me those patches.  Good luck!
