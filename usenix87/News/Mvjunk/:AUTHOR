	A couple of days ago, right after rmgroup'ing net.bizarre, and
net.misc.coke, a script that I had taken off of the net awhile ago went
and recreated them NET-WIDE. The script is mvjunk, which takes articles
that end up in the junk newsgroup, and puts them back into the groups 
they came from. I use it because wcom seems to get alot of articles that
it thinks are too old for it, or stuff posted to new newsgroups that we
haven't gotten newgroup control messages for yet, or groups that are
in regional distributions, but are so rarely posted to that we don't
know about them. Unfortunately, the script as originally distributed 
just did an inews -C, which results in the group being created net-wide.
I have modified it so that it only does it locally.

Thanks go to my fellow news administrators that pointed out the bug to me,
and sincere apologies to anyone whom the extraneous control messages have
inconvenienced.

The modified version of mvjunk follows:
