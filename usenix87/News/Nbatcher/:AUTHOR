[  This is the first of two batched news utility programs (BNUP, to coin
   an acronym).  It was written on a SystemV machine, but it looks like
   it would be fairly easy to convert to BSD and, e.g., the directory
   library.  Stuff dealing with the UUCP queue is much less portable,
   of course, but Bob nicely provides a default mechanism.  Take a look
   at the check_uucp routine, however -- I think you may want a different
   default value.  Also, I added a modified xerror routine that doesn't
   depend on knowing the internal's of the FILE struct.  I haven't
   tested it, but a "grep xerror *." seems to say I'm ok; add -DUSE_PORT_CODE
   for my version.  --r$ ]
