This program has been used here for several months and seems to be
stable.  I haven't had the opportunity to try it out on other UNIXes.

[  With Glen's permission, I added the code to use getopt rather than
   scanargs, and the "#ifdef BSD" code; I don't think I broke anything.
   Note that this program uses strtok() -- if it's not in your library,
   the mod.sources archives have two public-domain implementations of
   it and the other string functions.  I haven't tested the program as
   extensively as I might like to, because its utility to me is limited;
   we use notes here.  --r$ ]
