Do you ever get tired of sitting at the terminal and hitting the space
bar?  Well, you should.  You look silly doing it.  The following script
saves you the trouble by _printing_ the news.  If you have troff or
ditroff, it will print in columns in 8-point Roman condensed, so you
can pretend you're reading the New York Herald-Tribune.  It will even
unrot jokes that need it, if you have a suitable rot-detector.

Warnings: it's klugy.  You'll probably have to tweak it.  And don't start
it with the -uu option and then read news interactively; you'll clobber
your .newsrc.  And syshats hate it because it's a hog.

I think you'll like it.
