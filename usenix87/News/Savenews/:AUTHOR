Here is a netnews archiver similar to the recently posted keepnews but
designed to work with much larger archives where the wonderful quadratic
search time feature of the Unix (Unix is a trademark of AT&T Bell Labs,
quadratic search times are a feature of Unix) becomes a real problem. This
archive also knows how to walk through a directory tree so you can simply
set it on /usr/spool/oldnews and let it do its work. There are lots of
other nifty things I call features (and you might, too) that make it a lot
easier to use than anything else I've seen set up to work on archives. Mine
simply outgrew any capability to do anything with about the same time I got
a request for information out of it. I found out (the hard way) that
keepnews wasn't terribly reliable working under 2.10.2, so I finally
decided to hack together my own.

Comments, enhancements, bug fixes, etc... are welcome, but I can only work
on them on a time available basis...
