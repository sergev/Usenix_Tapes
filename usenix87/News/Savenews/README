Savenews --

Savenews is a short program designed to make handling of usenet archives
generated by 'expire -a' easier, and to make it possible to find stuff in
the archive once it is there. 

It was created by me when I had to get something out of my archives and
realized that there was no way I was going to find anything in 70 megabytes
of random data. It keeps a set of logs of the Subject lines of the articles
and stores the articles themselves in a hashed subdirectory format designed
to minimize the quadratic lookup hassles of the unix directory system
(This, of course, is a feature). 

It has been put into the public domain by national semiconductor, and
neither myself or national guarantee that this code even exists, much
less that it does anything useful. This, BTW, is a disclaimer.
