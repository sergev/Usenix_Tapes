	Here are two shell programs, "saversc" and "note" (plus manual pages),
for organizing sources from Usenet.  I wrote them to deal sensibly with my
ever-growing "miscellaneous net sources" directory, and have found them
enormously useful.  I expect other folks will find them helpful too.

Basically, "savesrc" will take a single program source file or a
shell archive, place it in a designated source directory or sub-directory
thereof, unshar it if necessary, generate a Makefile entry if necessary,
prompt for a half-line description of what the program does, attempt
to compile it, give the user a shell to twiddle it when it doesn't
work, and add entries to a file of notes indicating what it is, where
and whom it came from, when it arrived, and whether or not it works.
It will also deal sensibly with header files, bugs/fixes, and manual pages.
It can be used directly from "rn" as "| savesrc destination".

"Note" manages the files of notes on the sources.
