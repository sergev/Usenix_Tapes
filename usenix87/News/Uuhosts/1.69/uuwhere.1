.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fIuuwhere\fP command is used take a list of UUCP routes,
such as produced by \fIpathalias\fP, and make a similar list,
annotated by the geographical location of each host as found
in the UUCP map posted to USENET newsgroup mod.map.uucp.
It is ordinarily called with no arguments by \fIuuhosts\fP(1L),
and will update \fB/usr/local/lib/nmail.where\fP, taking routes from \fB/usr/local/lib/mail/palias\fP and locations
from \fB/usr/spool/maps/comp.mail.maps/Index\fP, if either
\fB/usr/local/lib/mail/palias\fP or \fB/usr/spool/maps/comp.mail.maps/Index\fP is newer than \fB/usr/local/lib/nmail.where\fP.
The information in \fB/usr/local/lib/nmail.where\fP is displayed by \fIuuhosts\fP itself.
.PP
Input file names may be specified as arguments.
This also causes output to go to standard output instead of directly to
Input file name \fI-\fP is taken to be standard input.
\fB/usr/local/lib/nmail.where\fP.
.TP
\-\fBc
\fIUuwhere\fP uses a \fIdbm\fP(3) database to store the location information
from \fB/usr/spool/maps/comp.mail.maps/Index\fP before creating output.
This option causes \fIuuwhere\fP to recreate the database regardless
of the state of any input files.
