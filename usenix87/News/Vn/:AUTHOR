This is the source for the alternate news reader vn.  I'm sending
you the four archives I put up in net.sources as four separate
mail messages.  Archive 1 contains documentation and a README file
concerning installation.  I tried to make these archives about the
size that seemed to be acceptable in existing mod.sources postings -
about 40K each.  If you are a devoted user of the other readers, copy
your .newsrc before you give this one a try - you might not like what
it does.  My justification is that a pretty fair number of people DO
like what it does - consider it an alternate paradigm which basically
got its start a few years back because I was getting sick of beating
on the 'n' key.
