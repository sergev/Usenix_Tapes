Here's a handy little script I use to at-a-glance see what is in
the news articles that are currently available in a newsgroup or
groups.  For some groups (like this one), I keep archives for a ways
back, so even though I've read the articles, I might want to go
back to one and build the tool that was in it.  I use this script
to peruse the contents of a group or groups, to see which articles
have what I'm looking for (or not looking for) in it.  The number of
the article is given, along with a summary taken from the header
'Subject:' line.  The output of this script is suitable for page or more.
