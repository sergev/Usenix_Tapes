I'll be leaving usenet for a while, so I am taking this last opportunity
to inflict my source code upon you (:-)).

This program scans your .newsrc file and tells you what news is waiting
for you to read. It is reasonably fast and has several useful options
(hopefully well-documented). We've been using it here for a few months.

The program assumes that the .newsrc. file is in the format used by
the 'rn' newsreader, but it seems to work with vnews,readnews format also.

Not having access to a BSD machine, I don't know what changes will have
to be made to port this to Berkeley Unix (it runs on System V), except
that strchr, strrchr will probably have to be changed to index,rindex.

Bye.
