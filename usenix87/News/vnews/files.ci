2 3 This lists the programs and files which are part of  vnews.   For
each file, the directory where it is installed is given.

vnews/vnews, installed in /usr/bin
        This is the vnews news reading program.

postnews/gparent, installed in /usr/bin
        This simple shell procedure writes writes the body of the
        article  specified  by  $A to the standard output.  It is
        intended for writing followups which reference the origi-
        nal  article.   For  example  from  vi  you  can  say ":r
        !gparent" to include the body of the original article  in
        your followup.  (This only works from vnews because post-
        news does not yet set $A.)

postnews/postnews, installed in /usr/bin
        This program allows users to post news items to the  net-
        work.  This version of postnews is much more sophisticat-
        ed than the 2.10.1 version of  postnews.   It  is  rather
        similar  to  the 2.10.2 version except that it allows you
        to search for specific titles or  authors  if  you  don't
        remember  the  number of an article you are writng a fol-
        lowup to.

postnews/postnm, installed in /usr/bin
        This program acts as a front end for inews.  To post news
        you  should  use  this  program instead of invoking inews
        directly.

lib/cgtdate, installed in /usr/lib/news
        This is program converts a date to UNIX* internal format.
        It is invoked by vnews to process the -a option.

postnews/postreply, installed in /usr/lib/news
        Thie program handles replies and followups for vnews.

postnews/distributions, installed in /usr/lib/news
        This file lists all the legal  distributions  that  users
        can specify (world, na, usa, local, etc.).

postnews/moderators, installed in /usr/lib/news
        This file  lists  the  moderators  of  various  moderated
        groups.

artfile/afbuild, installed in /usr/lib/news
        This program rebuilds /usr/lib/news/artfile from the his-
        tory  file.   It  also creates /usr/lib/news/groupfile if
        that file does not already exist.  (/usr/lib/news/artfile
        and /usr/lib/news/groupfile are described below.)

artfile/afinsert, installed in /usr/lib/news
        This program is invoked by an entry in the sys file every
        time  an article is received.  Its single argument is the
        contents of the history line for the article.  This  pro-
        gram    adds    an    entry    for    the    article   to
        /usr/lib/news/artfile.

artfile/dumprec
        This program writes out records in artfile.  Each  record
        is specified either by a message-ID or by its offset from
        the beginning of artfile.  This program is  intended  for
        debugging the artfile code.

artfile/dumpng
        This program lists the contents of a  newsgroup.   It  is
        also intended for debugging the artfile code, but the in-
        formation may prove useful for other purposes.

/usr/lib/news/artfile
        This file contains one entry for each article in the sys-
        tem.    It   can  be  accessed  by  various  routines  in
        lib/rlib.a; see lib/routines.doc for details.

/usr/lib/news/groupfile
        This file associates a small, unique  integer  with  each
        newsgroup on the system.

postnews/gparent.ml
        This is a macro for Gosling's EMACS that reads  the  body
        of  the  article specified by $A into the current buffer.
        It is intended for writing followups which reference  the
        original  article.   Normally, this macro should be bound
        to ^X^Y.  Compile -i will not install this anywhere,  but
        if you run Gosling's EMACS you should install it wherever
        you have your macro library.

postnews/gparent.wm
        This file contains a version of the gparent macro rewrit-
        ten to run under Warren Montgomery's EMACS.
