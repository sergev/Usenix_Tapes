This lists the programs and files which are part of vnews.
For each file, the directory where it is installed is given.
.f vnews/vnews /usr/bin
This is the vnews news reading program.
.f postnews/gparent /usr/bin
This simple shell procedure writes writes the body of the article
specified by $A to the standard output.  It is intended for writing
followups which reference the original article.  For example from vi
you can say ":r !gparent" to include the body of the original article
in your followup.  (This only works from vnews because postnews
does not yet set $A.)
.f postnews/postnews /usr/bin
This program allows users to post news items to the network.
This version of postnews is much more sophisticated than the
2.10.1 version of postnews.  It is rather similar to the 2.10.2
version except that it allows you to search for specific titles
or authors if you don't remember the number of an article you are
writng a followup to.
.f postnews/postnm /usr/bin
This program acts as a front end for inews.  To post news you should
use this program instead of invoking inews directly.
.f lib/cgtdate /usr/lib/news
This is program converts a date to UNIX* internal format.
It is invoked by vnews to process the -a option.
.f postnews/postreply /usr/lib/news
Thie program handles replies and followups for vnews.
.f postnews/distributions /usr/lib/news
This file lists all the legal distributions that users can specify
(world, na, usa, local, etc.).
.f postnews/moderators /usr/lib/news
This file lists the moderators of various moderated groups.
.f artfile/afbuild /usr/lib/news
This program rebuilds /usr/lib/news/artfile from the history file.
It also creates /usr/lib/news/groupfile if that file does not
already exist.  (/usr/lib/news/artfile and /usr/lib/news/groupfile
are described below.)
.f artfile/afinsert /usr/lib/news
This program is invoked by an entry in the sys file every time an
article is received.  Its single argument is the contents of the
history line for the article.  This program adds an entry for the
article to /usr/lib/news/artfile.
.f artfile/dumprec
This program writes out records in artfile.  Each record is specified
either by a message-ID or by its offset from the beginning of artfile.
This program is intended for debugging the artfile code.
.f artfile/dumpng
This program lists the contents of a newsgroup.  It is also intended
for debugging the artfile code, but the information may prove useful
for other purposes.
.f /usr/lib/news/artfile
This file contains one entry for each article in the system.
It can be accessed by various routines in lib/rlib.a; see lib/routines.doc
for details.
.f /usr/lib/news/groupfile
This file associates a small, unique integer with each newsgroup
on the system.
.f postnews/gparent.ml
This is a macro for Gosling's EMACS that reads the body of the article
specified by $A into the current buffer.  It is intended for writing
followups which reference the original article.  Normally, this macro
should be bound to ^X^Y.  Compile -i will not install this anywhere,
but if you run Gosling's EMACS you should install it wherever you have
your macro library.
.f postnews/gparent.wm
This file contains a version of the gparent macro rewritten to run
under Warren Montgomery's EMACS.
