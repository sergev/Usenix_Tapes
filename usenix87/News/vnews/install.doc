                      HOW TO INSTALL VNEWS



This release is designed to run with release 2.10 or 2.10.1 of
netnews, but should also work with release 2.10.2.  The steps re-
quired to install vnews are:

1)  Modify the transmit routine in inews to support the H flag.
The H flag causes inews to replace a %s in the command with the
contents of the history line.  The directory artfile contains two
versions of the file ifuncs.c.  Ifuncs.c.10.1 is based on release
2.10.1 while ifuncs.c.10.2 is based on release 2.10.2.  In both
files, the changes can be found by grepping for KSA.  Rebuild
inews with the appropriate version of ifuncs.c.

2)  Vnews has its own configuration program called "setup" which
works on a file named config.  Change directory to lib, and run
the mkconfig program.  This program expects as its single argu-
ment the name of the directory containing the netnews source.
You should probably cat the resulting config file to make sure it
looks reasonable.  Then run the setup shell procedure.  Read
setup.doc if you have problems.

3)  If you have terminals with more than 24 lines or more than 80
columns, increase MAXPLEN and MAXLLEN in vnews/virtterm.c.

4)  The next step is to compile and install all the programs.
Changing directory back to .. and running the compile shell pro-
cedure will compile everything.  Compile will complain if you
have distributions which it doesn't have descriptions for.  If
this happens, add the descriptions to the file postnews/distlist
and run compile again.  Compile -i will install all the programs.
It will also add an entry to your sys file to invoke afinsert
when new articles arrive.

5)  Run /usr/lib/news/afbuild to create artfile and groupfile
from the history file.  (Put it in the background; it's slow.)
Since you don't want artfile to grow without bound, you must re-
build it periodically.  Modify crontab to invoke afbuild after it
calls expire.

6)  You may wish to install vnews/vnews.1 and postnews/postnm.1
in /usr/man.  Also, if you run Gosling's or Warren Montgomery's
EMACS, install postnews/gparent.ml or postnews/gparent.wm,
respectively, in some suitable spot.
