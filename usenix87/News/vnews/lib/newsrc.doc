1.  FORMAT OF .NEWSRC FILE

Since the .newsrc file is shared between a number of news reading
programs, care should be taken to allow for the evolution of this file.
Lines in the file fall into several types.

1) Newsgroups lines.

A newsgroup line consists of a newsgroup name, followed by subscription
indication, followed by a flags field, followed by a list of article
numbers.  A line should not be considered to be a newsgroup line unless
the first character of the line is a lowercase letter and the
subscription indication immediately follows the newsgroup name.

The subscription indication consists of a ':' to indicate that the user
subscribes to this group, or an '!' to indicate that the user does not
subscribe to this group.

The flags field is currently unused but is reserved for future use.  It
consists of a word not beginning with a digit, and terminated by a
space.

The list of article numbers should not have any spaces in it.  It
consists of a comma separated list of articles which have been read.  A
range of articles may be indicated by two numbers separated by a minus
sign.

Ideally, newsgroups should be presented in the order in which they
appear in the .newsrc file, and newsgroups not appearing in the .newsrc
file should be shown last.  At any rate, the order of newsgroups in
the .newrc file should not be disturbed.

The crash recovery code writes updated lines to the end of the .newsrc
file as they are modified.  Therefore, the last entry in the .newsrc
file should be believed.  However, the first occurence of a newsgroup
in the .newsrc file gives it's display position.

2)  Unsubscribed discussions.

Any line beginning with a '<' contains a message-ID of a discussion
which has been unsubscribed to.  Followups to such articles should not
be shown.

3)  Comment lines.

All other lines should be treated as comment lines.  When the .newsrc
file is rewritten, comment lines should be output first.  2.10 deletes
certain comment lines; this is unacceptable.
