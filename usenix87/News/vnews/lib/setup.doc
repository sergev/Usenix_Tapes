Configuring the Netnews Software
.sp 3
The setup program is used to configure the netnews software.  To run it,
simply type "sh setup".  The setup program reads if file called "config",
which you must create, and sets up the netnews library.  The setup program
attempts to provide sensible defaults, but you must never the less provide
certain entries.
.p
Lines in the config file beginning with a "#" are considered to be comment
lines and are ignored.  Other lines should consist of a parameter name
followed by a value.  Certain parameters are boolean flags which should
be set to "yes" or "no".  If the name of a boolean flag is given without
specifying a value, the flag is set to "yes"
A sample config file appears below:
.sp
.nf
	newsusr news
	newsgrp news
	myorg BTL, Holmdel, NJ.
	mydomain .UUCP
	spool /tools/netnews/spool
	notify
	internet no
.fi
.p
The first four lines are required entries which you must provide values for.
.n newsusr
This is the owner (user name) of
.i inews .
If you are a superuser, you should probably create a new user id
(traditionally
.b news )
and use this id.
If you are not a superuser, you can use your own user id.
If you are able to, you should create a mail alias
.b usenet
and have mail to this alias forwarded to you.
This will make it easier for other sites to find the right person
in the presence of changing jobs and out of date or nonexistent
directory pages.
.n newsgrp
This is the group (name) to which
.i inews
belongs.
The same considerations as NEWSUSR apply.
.n myorg
This should be set to the name of your organization.
Please keep the name short, because it will be printed, along with
the electronic address and full name of the author of each message.
40 characters is probably a good upper bound on the length.
If the city and state or country of your organization are not obvious,
please try to include them.
If the organization name begins with a `/', it will be taken
as the name of a file.  The first line in that file will be used
as the organization.
This permits the same binary to be used on many different machines.
A good file name would be `/usr/lib/news/organization'.
For example, an organization might read ``Bell Labs, Murray Hill'',
or ``U.C. Berkeley'' or ``MIT'' or
``Computer Corp. America, Cambridge, Mass''.
.n mydomain
When generating internet addresses, this domain will be appended
to the local site name to form mailing address domains.
For example, on system ucbvax with user root, if MYDOMAIN is
set to ``.UUCP'', addresses generated will read ``root@ucbvax.UUCP''.
If MYDOMAIN is ``.Berkeley.ARPA'', the address would be
``root@ucbvax.Berkeley.ARPA''.
If your site is in more than one domain, use your primary domain.
The domain always begins with a period, unless the local site name
contains the domain; in this case MYDOMAIN should be the null string.
.in 0
.p
The following entries are not required for the setup program, but
the defaults used by the setup program may not work for you.
.n admin
This is the login name of the USENET administrator for this machine.
This may be different from newsusr.  The default is the person running
the setup program.
.n internet
If your system has a mailer that understands ARPA Internet
syntax addresses (user@domain) turn this on, and replies
will use the From or Reply-To headers.
Otherwise, set it to no and replies will use the Path header.
The default value for this parameter is "yes" because everyone
was supposed to install an internet mailer back in January of
1984.
.n sys
This is the version of UNIX you are running under.  (UNIX is a
trademark of AT&T Bell Laboratories.)  The following verions
of UNIX are defined:
.nf
    sys3	AT&T System III
    sys5	AT&T System V release 1
    sys5r2	AT&T System V release 2
    v7		AT&T Version 7 UNIX
    4.1bsd	Berkeley release 4.1
    4.2bsd	Berkeley release 4.2
.fi
Hopefully, this list will be expanded in the future.  For now,
simply choose the one that is closest to your version.
If you omit this paramter, setup will normally select the correct value.
.n path
This is the path search used by the setup program.  The default is
the value of $PATH.
.in 0
.p
The remaining parameters can be tuned as you see fit, but netnews
should run OK if you just use the defaults.
.n small
True if you are running on a 16 bit machine such as a PDP-11.
The default is yes if you are running on a PDP-11 under USG UNIX,
and no otherwise.
.n dftsub
The default subscription list.  If a user does not specify any list of
newsgroups, this will be used.  Popular choices are
.b all
and
.b general,all.general .
The default is
.b all .
.n admsub
This newsgroup (or newsgroup list) will always be selected unless the
user specifies a newsgroup list that doesn't include ADMSUB on the
command line.  That is, as long as the user doesn't use the
.b -n
flag to readnews on the command line, ADMSUB will always be selected.
The default is
.b general,all.announce .
The intent of this parameter is to have certain newsgroups which users
are required to subscribe to.
.n umask
Mask for
.i umask(2)
system call.
Set to something like 022 for a secure system.
Unsecure systems might want 002 or 000.
This mask controls the mode of news files created by the software.
Insecure modes would allow people to edit the files directly.
.n dftexp
The default number of days after which an article will expire.
2 weeks (14 days) is the default choice.
.n tmail
This is the version of the Berkeley
.i Mail
program that has the \-T option.
If left undefined, the
.b -M
option to
.i readnews
will be disabled.
.n page
The default program for which articles will be piped to for paging.
This can be disabled or changed by the environment variable PAGER.
If you have it, the Berkeley
.i more
command should be used, since the + option allows the headers to
be skipped.
If not specified, setup will look around your system in an attempt
to find a suitable program.
.n dfteditor
This is the full path name of the default editor to use during
followups and replies.
It should be set to the most popular text editor on your system.
As distributed,
.b vi
is used.
.n sendmail
This is the name of a sendmail program that understands the
.b -t
option.
.n mailer
This is the name of the mail program that recmail will invoke.
Unless you specify "internet no", this must be a mail program
that understand internet addresses.  The default is mail.
.n home
Some sites will want to run the same version of the object
code on multiple computers.  If home is defined, then the
directories lib and spool are assumed to be relative to the
login directory of the user home.
.n compadmin
Normally, the numeric user id of the netnews administrator
(specified by admin) is compiled into the netnews programs.
If compadmin is set to "yes", then the individual netnews
program will search the password file to know the numeric user id
of the netnews administrator.
.n myname
The name of your machine.  If you don't specify this, the netnews
programs will determine your system name either by using the
uname or gethostname system calls or by scanning /usr/include/whoami.h.
.n uname
Set this if the uname system call is available locally,
even though you are not a USG system.
This defaults to "yes" if you are on a USG system.
.n ghname
Define this if the 4.2BSD gethostname system call is available.
This defaults to "yes" if you are running 4.2 BSD.
.n v7mail
Define this if your system uses V7 mail conventions.
The V7 mail convention is that a mailbox contains several messages
concatenated, each message beginning with a line reading
``From user date'' and ending in a blank line.
If this is defined, articles saved will have these lines added
so that mail can be used to look at saved news.
.n spool
This directory contains subdirectories in which
news articles will be stored.
It is normally /usr/spool/news.
.PP
Briefly, for each newsgroup (say
.b net.general )
there will be a subdirectory /usr/spool/news/net/general
containing articles, whose filenames are sequential numbers, e.g.
/usr/spool/news/net/general/1, etc.
.PP
Each article file is in a mail-compatible format.
It begins with a number of header lines,
followed by a blank line, followed by the body of the article.
The format has deliberately been chosen to be compatible with the
ARPANET standard for mail documented in RFC 822.
.PP
You should place news in an area of the disk with enough free space
to hold news you intend to keep on line.
The total volume of news in net.all currently runs about 3MB/week.
If you expirenews after the default 2 weeks, you will need about 6MB
of disk space (plus some extra as a safety margin and to allow for
increased traffic in the future.)
If you only receive some of the newsgroups, or expire news after
a different interval, these figures can be adjusted accordingly.
Other newsgroup classes do not add much to the volume;
fa.all accounts for only about 80KB/week, and btl.all+bell.all
are only about 450KB/week.
.n lib
This directory will contain various system files.
It is normally /usr/lib/news.
.n bin
This is the directory in which
.i inews ,
.i readnews ,
and
.i checknews
are to be installed.
This is normally /usr/bin.
If you decide to set BINDIR to a local binary directory, you
should consider that the
.b rnews
command must be in a directory that can be found by
.b uuxqt ,
which only searches /bin and /usr/bin unless you modify uuxqt.
.n maxgroups
The maximum number of newsgroups that the software will support.
You may have to increase this as the network grows.
.n "buflen, lbuflen, datelen, fpathlen, namelen, pathlen"
See the description of defs.h in the file routines.doc for
a description of these.  Decreasing these values to save space
should not be done lightly.
