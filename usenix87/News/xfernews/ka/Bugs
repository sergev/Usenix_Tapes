We have made only some cosmetic mods to the original xfernews, primarily
to pass through any uucp flags we wish (such as -c and -L and -z).

There is a known bug in xfernews though.  If you start up a second xfernews
while one is still running (say after an hour or so) the second one
complains that the first one didn't remove the lock.  It then removes the
lock and continues on its merry way!  The first instance of xfernews
then runs into various difficulties, including losing its sense of
current directory, and generates lots of error messages before dying.
We have resolved that by only running xfernews every 2 or 3 hours.

Also, there is a naming conflict with xfernews and 2.10.2 news.
I renamed the xfer "sendnews" to "xsendnews" to solve the problem.

We're fairly well pleased with xfernews and have had few major problems.
I think it might make a worthwhile addition to 2.10.3 release.

(BTW Rick, how's the timing on that looking?)
