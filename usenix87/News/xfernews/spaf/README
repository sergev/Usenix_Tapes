See NROFFME.OUT for an explanation of how this "batching" scheme
works.

Modify common.h and mkspool to suit your configuration.  NROFFME
contains explanations of what various parameters mean.

Modify the makefile to reference the appropriate directories and
user/group names, then as root type make install.

news.send and news.recv are sample shell procedures to be invoked
from cron periodically.  The applicable crontab entries at gatech
are

	4,14,24,34,44,54 * * * *	/usr/lib/news/news.recv
	18 * * * *			/usr/lib/news/news.send

Note that the news.send script should be scheduled a few minutes
before a uucp contact is expected to minimize the latency of
articles waiting in the batching queue.
