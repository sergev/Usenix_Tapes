Folks:

The protocol specifications for the IP/TCP family of protocols are in
the Internet Protocol Transition Workbook, the Internet Protocol
Implementation Guide, the Internet Protocol Telnet Protocol and
Options, and the Internet Mail Protocols volumes.  These volumes
contain most of the protocols used in the ARPA-Internet community.
The Assigned Numbers (RFC-943) and Official Protocols (RFC-944) notes
provide a index and annotated index to the protocols.  All these above
are available from the Network Information Center (send a note to
NIC@SRI-NIC.ARPA).

Several of the Internet Protocol documents have now been issued as
military standards (MIL-STDs).  The MIL-STDs listed below are the
official DoD versions of these commmunication protocols and should be
consulted for any DoD implementations.

	Internet Protocol (IP)  		MIL-STD-1777
	Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)	MIL-STD-1778
	File Transfer Protocol (FTP)		MIL-STD-1780
	Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP)	MIL-STD-1781
	Telnet Protocol and Options (TELNET)	MIL-STD-1782

These documents may be ordered from:

	Naval Publications and Forms Center, Code 3015
	5801 Tabor Ave
	Philadelphia, PA 19120
	1-215-697-3321

Requests can be initiated by telephone, telegraph, or mail; however,
it is preferred that private industry use form DD1425, if possible.

The ARPA specifications for IP (RFC-791) and TCP (RFC-793) and the DoD
specifications above are intended to describe exactly the same
protocols.  Any difference in the protocols specified by these sets of
documents should be reported to DCA and to ARPA.  The RFCs and the
MIL-STDs for IP and TCP differ in style and level of detail.  It is
strongly advised that the two sets of documents be used together.  The
ARPA and the DoD specifications for the FTP, SMTP, and Telnet
protocols are essentially the same documents (RFCs 765, 821, 854).
The MIL-STD versions have been edited slightly.  Implementers should
also check the "Official Protocols" memo for comments on protocol
status or pending changes (RFC 944).
