You're right, we have nothing to do with X.400.

What I recommend is calling up either CCITT (I believe they do all the
X. standards) or the Institute for Computer Science and Technology (ICST).
ICST probably has copies of everybody's standards on-line or can at least
tell you better than I where to look next.  Their # is (301) 921-3151.

When I need a standard I go to ICST.  They have so many to choose from!
