Folks,
	Attached is an updated copy of the RFC sets I sent out recently.
This file is now kept in [SRI-NIC.ARPA]NETINFO:RFC-SETS.TXT, is available
via Anonymous FTP and will be updated when appropriate. If you do not 
have access to FTP, send a message to me or NIC@SRI-NIC.ARPA requesting
the file. I do not plan to send the file to the entire list again after
this.

	Also attached is a new file: [SRI-NIC.ARPA]NETINFO:TCP-IP-BIB.TXT
which contains a bibliography of recent articles pertaining to TCP/IP,
X.25, TP-4, and other standards.  

Cheers,
	Ole

If  you are ordering RFCs individually, the attached sets of RFCs can guide you
in ordering a complete list of RFCs by topic, such as  "mail"  and  "gateways".
Related  RFCs  are  grouped  together  within  each  set.  Call the DDN Network
Information Center if you need assistance in ordering RFCs.    RFCs  which  are
marked with an asterisk (*) are not included in the 1985 DDN Protocol Handbook.

The  attached  bibliography  of recent articles pertaining to TCP and IP, X.25,
the Transport Protocol (TP-4), OSI and other standards was compiled by the  DDN
Network Information Center (NIC) as a background reading list for vendors.  The
bibliography cites articles, mostly from the open  literature,  representing  a
variety  of  viewpoints.   It has not been sanctioned by any government agency,
nor does it contain references to the Requests for Comments (RFCs).    The  NIC
does not provide copies of these articles because they are readily available in
the open literature.  The NIC has copies of the DDN Protocol Handbook, the  RFC
index,  and  the OSD (Office of the Secretary of Defense) directives pertaining
to the DoD protocol suite.
