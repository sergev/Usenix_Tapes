[ NETINFO:DOMAIN-TEMPLATE.TXT ]                            [ 2/87, DBDOC ]

To establish a domain, the following information must be provided to
the NIC Domain Registrar (HOSTMASTER@SRI-NIC.ARPA):

   Note:  The key people must have computer mail mailboxes and
   NIC "Handles", unique NIC database identifiers.  If they do not
   at present, please remedy the situation at once.  A NIC Handle may
   be established by contacting REGISTRAR@SRI-NIC.ARPA.

   1)  The name of the top level domain to join.

      For example:  EDU

   2)  The name, title, mailing address, phone number, and organization
   of the administrative head of the organization.  This is the contact
   point for administrative and policy questions about the domain.  In
   the case of a research project, this should be the Principal
   Investigator.  The online mailbox and NIC Handle of this person should
   also be included.

      For example:

         Administrator

            Organization  USC/Information Sciences Institute
            Name          Keith Uncapher
            Title         Executive Director
            Mail Address  USC/ISI
                          4676 Admiralty Way, Suite 1001
                          Marina del Rey, CA. 90292-6695
            Phone Number  213-822-1511
            Net Mailbox   Uncapher@VENERA.ISI.EDU
            NIC Handle    KU

   3)  The name, title, mailing address, phone number, and organization
   of the domain technical contact.  The online mailbox and NIC Handle of
   the domain technical contact should also be included.  This is the
   contact point for problems with the domain and for updating
   information about the domain.  Also, the domain technical contact may
   be responsible for hosts in this domain.


      For example:

         Technical Contact

            Organization  USC/Information Sciences Institute
            Name          Craig Milo Rogers
            Title         Researcher
            Mail Address  USC/ISI
                          4676 Admiralty Way, Suite 1001
                          Marina del Rey, CA. 90292-6695
            Phone Number  213-822-1511
            Net Mailbox   Rogers@VENERA.ISI.EDU
            NIC Handle    CMR

   4)  The name, title, mailing address, phone number, and organization
   of the zone technical contact.  The online mailbox and NIC Handle of
   the zone technical contact should also be included.  This is the
   contact point for problems with the zone and for updating information
   about the zone.  In many cases the zone technical contact and the
   domain technical contact will be the same person.

      For example:

         Technical Contact

            Organization  USC/Information Sciences Institute
            Name          Craig Milo Rogers
            Title         Researcher
            Mail Address  USC/ISI
                          4676 Admiralty Way, Suite 1001
                          Marina del Rey, CA. 90292-6695
            Phone Number  213-822-1511
            Net Mailbox   Rogers@VENERA.ISI.EDU
            NIC Handle    CMR

   5)  The name of the domain (up to 12 characters).  This is the name
   that will be used in tables and lists associating the domain and the
   domain server addresses.  [While technically domain names can be
   quite long (programmers beware), shorter names are easier for people
   to cope with.]

      For example:  ALPHA-BETA

   6)  A description of the servers that provides the domain service for
   translating name to address for hosts in this domain, and the date
   they will be operational.


      A good way to answer this question is to say "Our server is
      supplied by person or company X and does whatever their standard
      issue server does".

         For example:  Our server is a copy of the server operated by
         the NIC, and will be installed and made operational on
         1-November-84.

   7)  Domains should provide at least two independent servers for the
   domain.  A description of the server machine and its back-up, including:

      (a) hardware and software (using keywords from the Assigned
       Numbers)

      (b) host domain name and net addresses (what host on what net for
       each connected net)

      (c) any domain-style nicknames (please limit your domain-style
       nickname request to one)

      For example:

         (a) hardware and software

            VAX-11/750  and  UNIX,    or
            IBM-PC      and  MS-DOS,  or
            DEC-1090    and  TOPS-20

         (b) host domain name and net address

             BAR.FOO.EDU 10.9.0.193 on ARPANET

         (c) domain-style nickname
  
            BR.FOO.EDU (same as BAR.FOO.EDU 10.9.0.13 on ARPANET)

   8)  Planned mapping of names of any other network hosts, other than
   the server machines, into the new domain's naming space.

       For example:

            FOO2-BAR.ARPA (10.8.0.193) -> BAR.FOO2.EDU
            FOO3-BAR.ARPA (10.7.0.193) -> BAR.FOO3.EDU
            FOO4-BAR.ARPA (10.6.0.193) -> BAR.FOO4.EDU

   9)  Delegation for networks in your domain for inclusion in the
   IN-ADDR.ZONE files, and the fully qualified domain names for the 
   IN-ADDR server sites for each network.  (If the IN-ADDR servers
   are omitted, the servers specified for the domain  will be used
   as the default when the IN-ADDR.ZONE file is generated.)

      For example:

      Address             Network Name   IN ADDR Servers

      41.IN-ADDR.ARPA     (BBN-TEST-A)  
      52.128.IN-ADDR.ARPA (MIT-AI-NET)   PREP.AI.MIT.EDU, HERMES.AI.MIT.EDU,
                                         GUTENBERG.AI.MIT.EDU

      (In the above example, a delegated IN ADDR Server was not
      specified for network 41.0.0.0, so delegation will default to
      the domain servers for the domain submitting the application.
      Whereas, the network at 128.52.0.0 will be delegated to the IN
      ADDR servers specified.)


  10)  An estimate of the number of hosts that will be in the domain.

      (a) initially,
      (b) within one year,
      (c) two years, and
      (d) five years.

      For example:

         (a) initially  =   50
         (b) one year   =  100
         (c) two years  =  200
         (d) five years =  500

  11)  A date when you expect the fully qualified domain name to
   become the official host name in HOSTS.TXT.

      Please note: If changing to a fully qualified domain name, e.g.
      FOO.BAR.EDU, causes a change to the official host name of an
      ARPANET or MILNET host, DCA approval must be obtained
      beforehand.  Allow 10 working days for your requested changes to
      be processed.  ARPANET sites should contact
      ARPANETMGR@DDN1.ARPA.  MILNET sites should contact
      HOSTMASTER@SRI-NIC.ARPA, (800) 235-3155, for further
      instructions.
