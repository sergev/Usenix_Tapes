Volume-Number: Volume 6, Number 29

This is the first of a series of five articles about timezones.
It is posted to make public previous discussions in this area
and not to stir up the issue again.  The time is propitious because
the U.S. President has just signed a new daylight savings time law.

The other four articles of this series form RFC.001,
which was submitted to the IEEE 1003.1 Working Group in
Florence on 18 April 1986.  The set of articles is as follows:

	V6N29 RFC.001 Timezones:  this article (not part of RFC.001 proper).
	V6N30 RFC.001 Summary of mod.std.unix Volume 5 by the moderator.
	V6N31 RFC.001 Timezone Interface (reposting of V5N65) by Robert Elz.
	V6N32 RFC.001 Timezone Examples (from V5N57) by Arthur Olson.
	    (just the examples from the last few pages, not the whole article).
	V6N33 RFC.001 Time Zone Proposal by jsq.

The last item has the same intent as the Elz article but is in a form which
should be usable as an actual proposal.  It may be submitted as such soon.

There was another RFC (from HP) which solved all the same problems but
by a slightly different mechanism.  Perhaps its author would like to post it?
