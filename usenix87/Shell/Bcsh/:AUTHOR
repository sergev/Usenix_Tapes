Okay, folks, I got enough requests for my Bourne shell script cshell-emulator
that I decided to post it.  It's grown a bit (well, actually, it's got
more than twice as big) since I first described it, and has quite a lot
more functionality.  Do NOT expect it to be as fast as the cshell, though.
After all, it *is* a shell script.  The primary intent of this program was
to provide cshell-like history for people familliar with the cshell who must
use a Bourne-shell-only system.  Hence, it also attempts to cope with
the problem of incompatible control-flow syntax between the two shells
(no more frustration from using "foreach i (...)" instead of "for i in ..."
and vice-versa).

I have not written a manual page for it 'cause I'm lazy -- er, I mean,
because it's pretty well covered by the regular shell manual pages.
I will actually do a man page and post it reasonably soon.
The features, bugs, etc. are all described in the voluminous comments at
the beginning of the script, which should really be peeled off as a
README file.

Enjoy it!  I'm still amazed how much of the cshell's functionality
can be done via shell.  It should work on a vanilla Bourne shell (and hence
has a lot of code duplication -- I'll do a cleaner version using shell
functions soon).

This is not a shar file.  Just cut on the line below and peel my signature
off the end.
