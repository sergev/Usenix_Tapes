	This is a set of context-diffs to implement job-control in the
	System-V Bourne Shell using sxt (layer) devices.

	It includes the additional files
		proc.c
		job.h
		README
		Makefile
		sxtalloc.c
		sxtalloc.8

	See README for installation details.

	To apply the diffs, its easiest to use Larry Wall's "patch" program,
	if you have it; otherwise its pretty hard work.
