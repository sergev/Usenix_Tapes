This and the following eight postings consist of files and context diffs
to add many long-desired features into the Bourne shell. The details of
the new features are listed below in README.gt.sh.  This is a list of
what each article contains

Part 1	-- README.gt.sh, new .c files needed for the shell, miscellany

Part 2	-- Context diffs of C code for 4.2 BSD /bin/sh
Part 3	-- Context diffs of C code for 4.2 BSD /bin/sh
Part 4	-- Context diffs of sh.1 for 4.2 BSD /bin/sh

Part 5	-- Context diffs of C code for System V Release 2 /bin/sh
Part 6	-- Context diffs of C code for System V Release 2 /bin/sh
Part 7	-- Context diffs of sh.1 for System V Release 2 /bin/sh

Part 8	-- Context diffs of C code for BRL Unix /usr/5bin/sh
Part 9	-- Context diffs of sh.1 for BRL Unix /usr/5bin/sh

I am sorry that there are so many articles; I had to do it this way to
insure that each one would be less that 64K in size.
