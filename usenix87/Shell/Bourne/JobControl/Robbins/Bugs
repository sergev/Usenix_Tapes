Bugs -- known problems in the shell.

The "suspend" built-in command is *very* naive.  E.g. cranking up a
subshell from vi, and then suspending it, will leave you sort of in limbo.
A control-Z will then suspend the vi.  Then a 'fg' command foregrounds the
stopped sub-shell. Control-D'ing the subshell puts you back in vi.

If the shell is being run from a terminal, and you interrupt it in the
middle of doing a here document (cat << FOO ..., interrupt before the FOO),
then if history was turned on, you will be left with history turned off.
Use set +H to turn it back on.

I do not have access to a PDP-11, so there will probably be problems
trying to move this stuff to a small address space machine.  Let me know
what you encounter, and I will encorporate any diffs that people send back
to me.

A recent posting in net.micro.att indicated that the Unix PC's window
manager uses $HOME/.history to save things. This is also the default for
where this history mechanism keeps things -- change the value of HISTFILE in
your .profile to be something different, and export it, if you're on a Unix PC.

****************

There are probably bugs in the code I have added to the shell.
I think I have caught everything, but I can't guarantee.  If you discover
any problems, please let me know, so that I can track them down and fix
them.

I regard this as a "first iteration."  In other words, I will not be suprised
if there are bugs.  I am counting on the net to be friendly enough to let
me know about any that may be discovered.  I am also open to suggestions for
other fixes or additions to the shell.  As things come in to me, I will
incorporate what I can, and hopefully post a new set of revisions.

Meanwhile, enjoy!
