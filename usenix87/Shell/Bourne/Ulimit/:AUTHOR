Mod.sources: Volume 6, Issue 49
Archive-name: sh.ulimit

The 4.2 BSD sh does not have any functional equivalent of the csh's 'limit'
built-in command. Below are some patches that provide the "ulimit" builtin,
basically compatible with that implemented in the ksh, which understands the
various BSD resource limits, as well as those available in System V. (Actually,
it is a little different in the output format; but at the time I wrote the code,
I only had ksh doc to go by, and not the ksh to test against. Oh well. 95% now
is better than 100% in two weeks.)

*** WARNING: This code has only been minimally tested in the BSD sh!!! ***
It is however, very straightforward, and shouldn't give you too many problems.
I pulled it out of the work I've been doing on the System V Release 2 shell.
(That work is still in progress, and maybe once things settle down with 4.3,
I'll be able to get back to it and post something.) It should be adaptable
to System V shells currently running under 4.2, such as the one in Doug
Gwyn's S5 emulation, and/or the Sun 3.0 shell (if you have source). Sun is
welcome to pick this up and add it in, as it is mostly based on Doug's code,
which is public domain.

This posting was motivated by some discussion a while back in net.unix and
net.unix-wizards. I hope it meets a need. (As for those who want job control
for the shell, see the nine part sh posting in volume 1 of mod.sources that I
did last summer. Several parts of that were diffs to the BSD sh, as well as
the S5R2 sh. I am working on that some more too.)

Enjoy,
