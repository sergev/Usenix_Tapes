This is a set of tool to manipulate Csh directory stacks.  It helps
bad typists a lot and also benefits people who deal with a lot of
directories.  I rarely type full pathnames after I started using it.

To try it out, type: source shdir.make, this will define some alias
for you to use.  Type 's' and see what happens.

To install it, type:     shdir.make.
Man page is in:          shdir.man.
