If you spend a lot of time prowling directory trees, the following Korn
shell functions are very handy. They provide a version of the "cd"
command that remembers which directories you've visited since
login. Remembered directories are maintained in a stack and labelled
with small integers; to cd to a directory you've already visited,
it is only necessary to say something like:
	r 3
which makes the 3rd directory in the stack the current working directory,
avoiding the necessity of retyping /horribly/long/directory/names.

These functions were inspired by the Csh pushd/popd/dirs commands, and
go much further than the Ksh "cd -" command. Although they are written
for the Korn shell, I have versions for Csh and /bin/sh if anyone
has trouble with the conversions involved. Overly verbose documentation
(including a little wall chart) appears in the shell file itself.
