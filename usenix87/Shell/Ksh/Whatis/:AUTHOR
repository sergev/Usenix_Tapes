Here is a function that pretty much implements the V8 shell 'whatis' builtin
command. This command, for each argument, prints out what it is in relation to
the shell. For each argument, it prints it out in the same way one would type
it as input to the shell, for instance, functions as their definitions and
parameters as assignment to their values.

It is just something I felt like trying to do as a ksh function, more for
fun than anything else.  Enjoy.
