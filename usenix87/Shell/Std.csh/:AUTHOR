Hello, you hackers who enjoyed Ken Turkowski's previous standard C program,
stdmain.c, and his standard /bin/sh script, I now present you with a new
standard script for /bin/csh, std.csh.  It is basically an argument parser, 
and will accept arbitrary argument formats:

	std -a -l -x -th0 -o outfile -
	std -alxth0 -ooutfile

...and related permutations can parse as:

	-a
	-l
	-x
	-t with argument h0
	-o with argument outfile
	-

just like stdmain.c and std.sh.  Convert all of your C-shell scripts now, so
you don't need to remember whether the -o argument should be attached or not!

I translated this script from Ken Turkowski's std.sh (i.e. I did no original
thinking). Ken tested and fixed it, but I take full responsibility for
the translation. Please forward any bug reports, suggestions, etc, to me.
