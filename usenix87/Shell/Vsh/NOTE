For PDP11's and similar machines:
Because of the granularity of memory pages on a PDP-11, it is advisable to
monitor closely the size of vsh.
The shell command file 'asfix' attempts to place the initialized strings of
vsh in text space, and can be incorporated into the makefile to increase the
amount of pure code and data that is shared.
However, it can happen that the text space may just cross a 4kword boundary
and because vsh should be loaded sharable, deprive the data area of almost
4k words of data.
Since vsh does not currently free memory allocated for option parameters,
it is possible for vsh to run out of memory.
Thus it may be reasonable to place some of the string data back in data space
just to allow more space for the data segment.
One, of course, could always:
	load vsh I&D
	load vsh non-sharable
	recode to free up option data
	reclaim some of the stack segment
