	The files genhelp, genhelp.dan, rmhelp, showhelp, vsh.doc all
belong in /usr/lib/vsh.

	vshelp is a sample help menu for novices. Set helpfile to vshelp
before entering VSH (in .vshrc) to use a help menu. It is not very compatible
with multi column directory displays.

	vshrc is a sample initialization file which is similar to the way
I like to use VSH. Its companion helpfile is genhelp.dan .

	*.beg are sample configuration files for a beginner. We use a
simply configured JOVE editor but I put in VI in *.beg since not everyone has
JOVE. In particular, a help menu is provided.
