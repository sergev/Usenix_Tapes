	A sample termcap entry with CS, CB, BO, BE.

CS	Change Scroll region
CB	Clear to Beginning
BO	Blink On
BE	Blink End

	CB, BO, BE are non-standard (at least they are not documented,
but then neither is BL or padding for SO and SE), and are not necessary
but are cosmetic.
	Note also that a CS reset has been included in CL. This change is
highly recommended.
	See the discussion in CHANGES.
