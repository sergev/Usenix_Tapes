This package contains a program called movie, which is a realtime
playback program for a set of SUN rasterfiles.  The code works on
both SUN-2 and SUN-3 bitmap displays.  It is something like framedemo,
but it uses rasterfile(5) files.  IT DOES NOT RUN UNDER SUN WINDOWS.
SUNwindows does not provide enough control of the screen or enough
speed to do this kind of stuff.  It provides single frame, forward
and backward loops with variable speed, mouse-stepped playback, and
other miscellaneous features.

I think the code is reasonable,  It tries to avoid magic as much as
possible.  I must warn you, however, that the whole thing was written
in a week, and there may be a few ugly and/or mysterious sections.
I'm sending it out because I probably won't be adding much more to it,
or spending much time cleaning it up.

Included are a makefile and a manual.

Happy Graphics!
