.TH MOVIE 1
.SH NAME
movie - realtime playback of SUN rasterfiles
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B movie
[-p r c] [-s file]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B movie
reads a set of rasterfiles (see
.I rasterfile(5)\fR)
and stores them in memory.  It provides a number of functions for
animating the sequence of rasters on the SUN bitmap display.  These
functions are described in the
.B Playback Functions
section below.
.sp
.B movie
.I does not
run under SUN-Windows.  It uses the mouse for frame and speed control,
as well as menu selection of playback functions.
.sp
The screen is divided into 5 areas.  The left square part of the screen
(900 * 900 pixels) is the frame area. All rasters are displayed here.
The right part of the screen comprises a single information line at the
top of the screen, a mouse button line, a menu area, and a menu page 
selection area.
.sp
The information line displays the currently displayed frame number,
the number of the last frame, and a speed indicator.  The speed
controls the frame presentation rate during playback.  The speed is
shown as a number between 0 and 100.  A speed of 0 indicates no motion.
A speed of 100 indicates the maximum possible redisplay rate.  When
frames are being presented in reverse sequence, as in a
.B Backward Loop,
the speed is shown as a negative number.
.sp
The mouse button line shows the status of the three mouse buttons.
The line is divided into 3 areas, corresponding to the left,
centre, and right mouse buttons.  The effect of pressing one of
the buttons is indicated in the appropriate area.
.sp
The menu is displayed below the mouse button line.  Each menu 
item is shown in a reverse video line.  The menu cursor moves
up and down through the menu, and reverses the bits in the line
under the cursor. 
.sp
The menu page selection area is at the bottom of the menu.  It has
two areas, labeled \*(lq+\*(rq and \*(lq-\*(rq, which will switch to the next 
or previous menu page.  This feature unnecessary for
.B movie,
as only the first menu page has any \*(lqlive\*(rq entries, but is
there for future expansion.  The menu contains 16 pages, each
of 32 menu items.  The current page number is displayed to
the right of the \*(lq-\*(rq selector.
.sp
Mouse motion is up/down to select menu items.  Playback functions
generally take up/down motions to cause increase/decrease in playback
speed, and left/right motions to indicate previous/next frame selection.
.sp
The position of the upper left corner of displayed frames may be
set by the command line
.B -p
option.  The following two integers are taken as row and column offsets.
.sp
By default
.B movie
will read rasterfiles from the current directory. Files with names of the
form 
.I frame.#
(where # is a number) are read into memory.  The files must be numbered
sequentially, beginning with frame.0.  This is similar to the convention
used by the SUN demo program
.B framedemo,
but note that in this case the files are in 
.I rasterfile
format.
The
.B -s
option overrides the reading of the \*(lqframe.#\*(rq files.  The argument
following the 
.B -s
option indicates a file to be read, which contains a list of
rasterfiles to read in sequence.
.SH "PLAYBACK FUNCTIONS"
.B First Frame
.br
Displays the first frame
.sp
.B Next Frame
.br
Displays the next frame in the sequence, without wrap-around.
.sp
.B Previous Frame
.br
Displays the previous frame in the sequence, without wrap-around.
.sp
.B Last Frame
.br
Displays the last frame in the sequence.
.sp
.B Single Frame
.br
Single frame playback. The left and right mouse
buttons select the previous and next frames.
.sp
.B Forward Play Once
.br
Plays the sequence from first to last frame once, at the current 
frame speed.
.sp
.B Backward Play Once
.br
Plays the sequence from last to first frame once, at the current 
frame speed.
.sp
.B Forward Loop
.br
Play the sequence continually, from first to last frame.  The 
playback speed may be adjusted with up/down mouse motion, or
with the left and right mouse buttons.
.sp
.B Backward Loop
.br
Play the sequence continually, from last to first frame.  The 
playback speed may be adjusted with up/down mouse motion, or
with the left and right mouse buttons.
.sp
.B Back and Forth Loop
.br
Play the sequence continually, from first to last, then last to first
frame.  The playback speed may be adjusted with up/down mouse motion, or
with the left and right mouse buttons.
.sp
.B Variable Speed Loop
.br
Play the sequence continually, The 
playback speed may be adjusted with up/down mouse motion, or
with the left and right mouse buttons. The playback direction
may be changed by moving the speed through 0.  Negative
speed indicates reverse playback.
.sp
.B Scroll With Mouse
.br
Frames are displayed one at a time.  Left/right mouse motion displays 
previous/next frames.
.sp
.B Position Frame
.br
Allows the upper left starting position of displayed frames
to be adjusted interactively.  A box is drawn around the frame,
and moved within the frame area with mouse motion.  Pressing
the left mouse button causes frame display to take place at the
new position.
.sp
.B Reverse Frame Video
.br
Reverses the black/white sense of displayed frames.
.sp
.B Quit
.br
Exits the
.B movie
program.
.SH ACKNOWLEDGEMENT
The playback functions in 
.B movie
are similar to the 
.B S-Dynamics
animation playback program on our
.B Symbolics 3650.
I thank the authors of that software for giving me the idea
to write this one.   This program is, however, in no way
copied or translated from that code.
