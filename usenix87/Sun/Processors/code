Here is a little code that returns a 1 on a 68020 and a 0 on the
680{00,10}.  We needed this for some machine dependant code on the
Sun-2 and Sun-3.  After I wrote this, someone told me Sun has a function
called "is68020" which I assume does about the same as this.  This
works because the "scale factor" is ignored on the 680{00,10} processors.
