This is a single-player (sigh!) game for SunView on Sun-3's.  It is probably
too dear in computrons for a Sun-2 (although I have not tried it).
It is distributed in six shar-format files, each about 50kbytes.

It compiles under 3.0 and 3.2, at least, and runs on 3/160's, 75's and 3/50's.
(I guess it will not work well in color since I didn't think much about this.
I'm told it looks ok on color Sun-3/160's and 110's.  No reports on 260's, yet.

For 3.0, you will want to define the SUN3.0 variable in the makefile.
The game will compile under 3.2 with the SUN3.0 variable define, but
the pie menu is not quite so pleasant.

The game object itself is close to a megabyte, and another megabyte of
temporary storage for .o's and things needs to be available during the
make process.

To get going, just say 'make'.  (I presume you have already unshared it
if you are reading this.)  If you want a scorefile, edit the first
line of the makefile to point to it, make the file (rw to all).  You should
explicitly then install the game someplace handy (such as /usr/local/bin),
and the man entry as well.

Other information is in the files NOTES, TODO, HISTORY.nr, and sdi.man.
