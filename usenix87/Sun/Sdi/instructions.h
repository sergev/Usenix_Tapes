"To get started, just click where it says, and try to blow up the\n\
missiles, by 'mouse-clicking' at them, before they get your cities.\n\
Different mouse buttons have different effects.\n\
\n\
The three top 'sliders' show the 'ammo' associated with your three\n\
mouse buttons. The two bottom 'sliders' show the missiles-in-flight and\n\
missiles-on-the-ground, respectively.\n\
\n\
The 'Things To Read' button pops up an assortment of reading options,\n\
including the manual entry.  The different 'options' buttons also pop\n\
up subwindows.\n\
\n\
The game is automatically suspended when in a subwindow.  If you want\n\
to retain the subwindow while playing, just explicitly 'resume' the game.\n\
\n\
Try the 'Things to Read' button for more information."
