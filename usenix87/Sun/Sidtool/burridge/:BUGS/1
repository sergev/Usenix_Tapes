Sidtool (Pacman for the Sun3) has been out on the net for about six weeks
so it has been given some use. The following bugs with their fixes have
been found.  Please apply these diffs to the original version of Sidtool,
if you haven't done so already.

There is still the problem of occasionally "losing" a motion character,
I'm still trying to track that one down.


(1) Problem with the keypad bindings on arrow keys not being replaced.
    In sid_stuff.c: routine function_keys:

<    if (state == KEY_SET) get_key(fd,key_stations[i],old_key_vals[i],count) ;
<    set_key(fd,key_stations[i],new_key_vals[i],count++) ;
---
>    if (state == KEY_SET)
>      {
>        get_key(fd,key_stations[i],old_key_vals[i],count) ;
>        set_key(fd,key_stations[i],new_key_vals[i],count++) ;
>      }
>    else set_key(fd,key_stations[i],old_key_vals[i],count++) ;


(2) Problem with not going on to successive screens.
    In sid_blt.c: routine reset_maze:

823c823
<   int i ;
---
>   int i,j ;
830c830
<       for (i = 0; i < 10; i++) LONGPAUSE() ;
---
>       for (j = 0; j < 10; j++) LONGPAUSE() ;


(3) Problem with the panel items being corrupted.
    In sid_sun.c: routine toolsw_selected:

60d59
< char lastc = '\0' ;      /* Previous character sent down the socket. */
139c138
<   char c = '\0' ;
---
>   char c ;
159d157
<         if (lastc != DEL)
166d163
<   if (c) lastc = c ;


(4) Extra copy of the small screen being left when the player scores
    10000, and gets an extra man.
    In sid_blt.c: routine updatescore:

901c901
<   int i,temp,x,y ;
---
>   int i,j,temp,x,y ;
918c918
<             for (i = 0; i < 10; i++) LONGPAUSE() ;
---
>             for (j = 0; j < 10; j++) LONGPAUSE() ;

If anybody else has found anymore please let me know, and I'll include
them in the next version. Also if anybody has added any speed improvements
I would be pleased to know.

Regards Rich.
