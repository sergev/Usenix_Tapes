	[I've actually tried this on our Sun50.  It's pretty neat.
	 This version *includes* the first official patch for the
	 game.  Note that the default is for the support files to
	 be in the same directory as the game.  Edit "sidtool.h"
	 if you want to change this.  Note also that the mouse
	 cursor has to be inside the sidtool window for it to
	 recognize the DEL key.   -br]
