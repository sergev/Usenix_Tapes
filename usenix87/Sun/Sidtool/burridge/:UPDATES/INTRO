Subject: Sid Tool (Pacman)
Keywords: Sun O/S v3.2 or later.
From: richb@sunk.oz (Rich Burridge @ Sun Microsystems Australia)

This is the next major release of sidtool, the pacman like game
for the Sun. This version has been rewritten to use SunView.
Outwardly, there is not much difference, inwardly in now uses
a state automation machine, to achieve the different states in
"real-time", and also give the Notifier a chance to do its "thing".

This version has got a fair chance of working reasonably on a Sun2,
by altering the SPEED definition in sidtool.h (probably down to 0).
I haven't got a Sun2, so that hasn't been tested.

I'll expect to rewrite this again in about six monthes time in NeWS,
and at the time, the design of the graphics might also change.

[To John Gilmore / Rich Morin: this is the version you should use
 for the forthcoming Sun User Group tape.]

Please start with the README.

Happy debugging,

    Rich.
