  Welcome to sidtool version 2.1.  -  April 1987.

This software is the second major release of the Sun Interactive
Debugger program, better known as sidtool. It probably still
contains bugs (and features). Should you find any of these, I
would be pleased to hear about them, and try to remove them.

This software will only work correctly with SunOS v3.2 or later.
With a small effort, it could probably be made to run under v3.0,
but this is not supported.

SETUP.
Note there is a #define in sidtool.h called SPEED. Experimentation
with this should give a better timing for other machines such as 
Sun2s and the 3/260s.

Unpack these files into a directory, alter the BINDIR line in
the top level Makefile to be where you want the sidtool release
to be put, and type "make install".

DISCLAIMER.
This software was developed and tested on a 3/50. It is recognised
that this software runs slowly on Sun2s, and that there are
probably timing problems on other Sun3s. If you find a good pause
factor, please let me know.

OPTIONS.
There are a few command line options for alternately specifying
where some of the files used by sidtool can be found. These are:

 -afilename   -  New animate filename.
 -cspeed      -  New class (speed) of machine.
 -d           -  Run in self demonstration mode.
 -hfilename   -  New help filename.
 -mfilename   -  New maze filename.
 -sfilename   -  New high score filename.

The replacement filenames can also be specified by environment
variables. These are:

 SID_MAZE    -  New maze filename.
 SID_ANIMATE -  New animate filename.
 SID_SCORE   -  New high score filename.
 SID_HELP    -  New help filename.

KNOWN BUGS AND FEATURES:    None known.

Have fun,
