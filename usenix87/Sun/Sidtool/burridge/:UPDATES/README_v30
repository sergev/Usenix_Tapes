Firstly, sidtool was compiled and tested on v3.2 of SunOS and
will work correctly work on v3.2 or later. I mentioned this in
the news Keywords line, but I should really have also stated it
in the README.  This is fixed in the patches below.

Tony Kusalik (kusalik@sask.bitnet) has retrofitted it back to
v3.0 (thanks Tony). Here are the things to look out for.

(1) Declarations for Pixfont should be changed to struct pixfont
(2) Declarations for Pixrect should be changed to struct pixrect
(3) Declarations for Pixwin should be changed to struct pixwin
(4) fcntl.h was in /usr/include in v3.0 not /usr/include/sys.
(5) In sid_main.c, remove the lines:
             CANVAS_FAST_MONO, TRUE,
    -and-    window_set(canvas, WIN_CONSUME_KBD_EVENTS, WIN_LEFT_KEYS, 0) ;

These are the ones Tony mentioned to me, and should solve most of
the problems. I do not support v3.0, so you are on your own.
