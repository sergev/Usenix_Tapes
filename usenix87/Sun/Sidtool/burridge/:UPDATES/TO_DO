There is a known problem of sidtool leaving a bogus copy of the Sun
screen lying around when it's in eating mode, and it "eats", a pair
of eyes going back home to be reincarnated.

This is proving to be difficult to consistently recreate, so that
fix hopefully will be in the next set of patches.

Look out for a mouse "joystick" interface to sidtool, coming soon.
