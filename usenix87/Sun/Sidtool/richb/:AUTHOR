Subject: Sid Tool - another PacMan (Part 1 of 4)


This is for all you people who are fed up with hearing:
"Yes I know, but what games has it got?"

It's a game of PacMan for the Sun3. With a little bit of work by the
SUN graphics experts it could be made to run acceptably on a Sun 2.
Please let me know how you do it.

With just a little bit more work, it could be ported to another bitblt
type workstation. I would again be interested to hear about that.

Bug,problems,improvements (yea),fixes,comments etc to me please.
