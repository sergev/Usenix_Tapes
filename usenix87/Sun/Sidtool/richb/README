  Welcome to Sun Debugger Version 1.5 - June 1986.

  This software is the first general release of the Debugger program and
associated files. It probabily still contains bugs (and features). Should
you find any of these, I would be pleased to hear about them, and try to
remove them before the next version.

DISCLAIMER.
  It is recognised that this software runs slowly on a Sun 2, but should
be much better on a Sun 3.

KNOWN BUGS AND FEATURES:
  None known.

Have fun,

  Rich Burridge, SUN Melbourne Australia.  (03) 267 6222    <richb@yarra.oz>
