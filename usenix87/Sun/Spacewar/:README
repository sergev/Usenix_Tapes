After a couple of months of beta-testing, I have decided to release
Spacewar upon the masses.  It will run only on Sun-3 machines with a
68881 chip running Sun UNIX 3.0 release or later.  For those who have
the beta test version already, this version no longer uses ethernet
broadcasts for screen updates and I have added asteroids as additional
obsticles to avoid.  Enjoy!
