SPACEWAR Version 2.0

Copyright 1987 Jonathan Biggar

Permission is given to copy and distribute for non-profit purposes.

This game will only operate on a Sun-3 processor with a 68881 chip
and a 1152x900 monochrome or color monitor, running Sun 3.0 UNIX or later.

INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:

1.	Unpack this kit in an empty directory and edit Makefile.
	Change the SCOREFILE, BYMACHINE, .c.o, and MANLOC options if you wish.

2.	run 'make install' as root.  This program must run setuid root
	because it uses udp broadcasts.

3..	Edit /etc/services (or update the yellow pages map) and add the
	following lines:

spacewar	700/udp
spaceward	701/udp

	the port numbers don't matter, as long as they are unique, and
	less than 1024.

4.	Pick a single machine on your ethernet to run the spacewar daemon.
	This machine MUST NOT be used to play the game also--spacewar
	is too much of a cpu hog.  Edit /etc/servers on this machine and
	add the line:

spaceward	udp	/usr/games/lib/spaceward

	Then restart the "inetd" process on that machine.

5.	Get a friend or two and each run /usr/games/spacewar on different
	workstations.

NOTE:

Only one spacewar server can run on an ethernet.  If you try to run
more than one, it will get VERY confusing.
