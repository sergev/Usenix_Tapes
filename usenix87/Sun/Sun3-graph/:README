For you recreational computing fans, here is a program to waste 
some time with.  Sorry if this is a rehash of some earlier posting, 
but it has been going on a year since the Scientific American article 
came out, so many readers may have missed any eariler version(s).

It draws nice stuff on your raw sun screen. 

The figures look like lace doilies, or oriental rug patterns, or when 
magnified, fine cell structure and other biological wonders.

Try these arguments for fun:
    hop	 5	13	1400    (default)
    hop	30	20	10 	(good at mag 4)
    hop	0.3	1.5	12
    hop	12	0.9	124
    hop	14 	0.9 	124
    hop	-12 	-3 	-45 	(good at mag 4)
    hop	16 	1.333 	121

Hop.c has compilation info in the header comment.
Enjoy.
