This is about the magnifying glass for Sun3s.

The program, glass, takes one argument, which quantifies the magnification it
is to do. If no argument is supplied, glass assumes you mean no magnification.
Glass opens it's own window to display the magnified image.  The image
is a region to the upper left of the cursor, the direction the cursor points,
with the lower right corner of the window corresponding to the tip of the
cursor.

To compile, use the makefile provided.

Magnification can be changed, and the screen update time changed, with
sliders in the glass tool.  Also, the magnifier can be 'locked' onto
a given screen position.  Also, color now works.
