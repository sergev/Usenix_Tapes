This is about the magnifying glass for Sun3s.

The program, glass, takes one argument, which quantifies the magnification it
is to do. If no argument is supplied, glass assumes you mean no magnification.
Glass opens it's own window to display the magnified image.  The image
is a region to the upper left of the cursor, the direction the cursor points,
with the lower right corner of the window corresponding to the tip of the
cursor.

To compile, use the makefile provided.

Glass has several shortcomings right now.

 o		There should be a way to dynamically set the magnification
		factor.  This is easy to do, but who has time?

 o		The program is too slow for small magnification.  Unary
		magnification is fast since a single bitblit is all that
		is needed, and large magnification is fast, since there
		aren't many pixels to do.  I'd be happy if Sun would
		add a "pr_mag" to the sunview library, and thereby get the
		job done without going through all the indirection that users
		have to.

 o		Glass eats up all your spare cycles.  Maybe this isn't too
		bad, especially if you don't use it all the time.  Also
		fixing it (via nice or sleep) might make it slower than
		you like.			

 o		Lint complains about all the sunview library calls that are
		defined in header files and not used.  Too bad.

If anyone decides to fix these, please mail me a copy of the changes.
I, of course, will post any changes I make.
