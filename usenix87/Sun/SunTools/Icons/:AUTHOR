As you may know the Sun icon editor only edits icons of the size 64x64
or 16x16.  I have written three small utility programs to edit and show
icons on a terminal.

moveicon: moves a 64x64 icon in the X/Y plane (either -/-, -/+, +/-  or +/+)
          and outputs an icon-style file of a 64x64 icon.
trimicon: takes a 64x64 icon, trims off bits beyond the specified width and
	  height and outputs a width by height size icon file.
showicon: shows a 64x64 icon on a terminal using x's.

There is a fourth program called showpix (still being hacked w/ from time 
to time) which shows arbitrary sized pixrects on a Sun.  It takes a list 
of files as arguments and opens a tool for viewing them.

Enjoy
