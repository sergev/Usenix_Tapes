This works well on a sun, it converts 24bit images stored in
3 files into a screen image.

The usage is: display filename [wide [high]]

"filename" is assumed to be a name for 3 files filename{R,G,B} The
default width is set to 512.  The path has a maximum length(1024
currently).  Height defaults to width unless specified.  The program
can be configured for various color limitations (and has been tested at
1/1/1, 2/2/1, and 3/3/2 bits of RGB) this fits in with some rgb
printers, the Amiga, and the Sun color frame buffer respectively.

This code was posted to net.sources a few weeks ago, but has improved
in usability and readability since then (not to mention speed and
configurability).
