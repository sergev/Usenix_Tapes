This directory contains the public domain Sun rpc/xdr code.  There
are several subdirectories:

	doc	Rpc/xdr documentation in .ms format.  See doc/README
		for more information.

	rpclib	The rpc/xdr library source code.  At Sun, RPC is part
		of the C library (libc.a).  This makefile will make a
		library called rpclib.

	tools	Two source files and their manual pages.

		portmap.c is the source to /etc/portmap, the rpc
		daemon which must be started by root before any other
		rpc servers or clients.

		rpcinfo.c dumps the information that portmap keeps.
		At Sun, it lives in /usr/etc/rpcinfo.

		Both source files assume the the rpc dot-h files
		have been installed in /usr/include.

	toys	Source to a toy sort service which can be used to test
		out the rpc/xdr library.

	rpcgen	The RPC protocol compiler.  See the README file.


The rpc/xdr library was built with a post-1.1 Sun release of the
compiler.  Old compilers complain about valid C.  You can make old
compilers happy by changing some voids to ints.  However, the fix to
the 4.2 VAX compiler is as follows:

trees.c:

removed spurious type mismatch errors in expressions involving
pointers to void functions, e.g., void foo(){...} void (*f)() = foo;
