.LP
In order to do an RPC callback,
you need a program number to make the RPC call on.
Since this will be a dynamically generated program number,
it should be in the transient range, 0x40000000 - 0x5fffffff.
The routine
.LW gettransient()
returns a valid program number in the transient range,
and registers it with the portmapper.
It only talks to the portmapper running on the same machine as the
.LW gettransient()
routine itself.
The call to
.LW pmap_set()
is a test and set operation,
in that it indivisibly tests whether a program number
has already been registered,
and if it has not, then reserves it.
On return, the
.LW sockp
argument will contain a socket that can be used
as the argument to an
.LW svcudp_create()
or
.LW svctcp_create()
call.

The following pair of programs illustrate how to use the
.LW gettransient()
routine.
The client makes an RPC call to the server,
passing it a transient program number.
Then the client waits around to receive a callback
from the server at that program number.
The server registers the program
.LW EXAMPLEPROG ,
so that it can receive the RPC call
informing it of the callback program number.
Then at some random time (on receiving an
.LW ALRM
signal in this example), it sends a callback RPC call,
using the program number it received earlier.

The parameter

is the name of the machine on which the information was created;
.LW uid
is the user's user ID;
.LW gid

.Lf
.BE
Calls the remote procedure associated with
.LW prognum ,

and
.LW procnum
on the machine,
.LW host .
The parameter
.LW in
is the address of the procedure's argument(s), and
.LW out
is the address of where to place the result(s);
.LW inproc
is used to encode the procedure's parameters, and
.LW outproc
is used to decode the procedure's results.
This routine returns zero if it succeeds, or the value of
.LW "enum clnt_stat"
cast to an integer if it fails.
The routine
.LW clnt_perrno()
is handy for translating failure statuses into messages.

.BE
Like

whose form is

.Lf
.BE
A macro that calls the remote procedure

The parameter
.LW in
is the address of the procedure's argument(s), and
.LW out
is the address of where to place the result(s);

A macro that frees any data allocated by the RPC/XDR system
when it decoded the results of an RPC call.
The parameter
.LW out

is the XDR routine describing the results in simple primitives.
This routine returns one if the results were successfully freed,

.SH
clntraw_create()

clntraw_create(prognum, versnum)

.Lf
.BE
This routine creates a toy RPC client for the remote program
.LW prognum ,
version
.LW versnum .
The transport used to pass messages to the service
is actually a buffer within the process's address space,
so the corresponding RPC server should live in the same address space; see
.LW svcraw_create() .
This allows simulation of RPC and acquisition of RPC overheads,
such as round trip times, without any kernel interference.
This routine returns

.Lf
.BE
This routine creates an RPC client for the remote program
.LW prognum ,
version
.LW versnum ;
the client uses TCP/IP as a transport.
The remote program is located at Internet address
.LW *addr .
If
.LW addr->sin_port
is zero, then it is set to the actual port that the remote
program is listening on (the remote
.I portmap
service is consulted for this information).
The parameter
.LW *sockp
is a socket; if it is
.LW RPC_ANYSOCK ,
then this routine opens a new one and sets
.LW *sockp .
Since TCP-based RPC uses buffered I/O, the user may specify
the size of the send and receive buffers with the parameters
.LW sendsz
and
.LW recvsz ;
values of zero choose suitable defaults.
This routine returns
.LW NULL
if it fails.

.Lf
.BE
This routine creates an RPC client for the remote program
.LW prognum ,
version
.LW versnum ;
the client uses use UDP/IP as a transport.
The remote program is located at Internet address
.LW *addr .
If
.LW addr->sin_port
is zero, then it is set to actual port that the remote
program is listening on (the remote
.I portmap
service is consulted for this information).
The parameter
.LW *sockp
is a socket; if it is
.LW RPC_ANYSOCK ,
then this routine opens a new one and sets
.LW *sockp .
The UDP transport resends the call message in intervals of
.LW wait
time until a response is received or until the call times out.
The total time for the call to time out is specified by
.LW clnt_call() .
Warning: since UDP-based RPC messages can only hold up to 8 Kbytes
of encoded data, this transport cannot be used for procedures
that take large arguments or return huge results.

.I portmap
service, which returns the port number
on which waits a service that supports program number
.LW prognum ,
version
.LW versnum ,
and speaks the transport protocol associated with protocol.
A return value of zero means that the mapping does not exist or that
the RPC system failured to contact the remote

contains the RPC status.

.BE
A user interface to the
.I portmap
service, which instructs
.I portmap
on the host at IP address
.LW *addr
to make an RPC call on your behalf to a procedure on that host.
The parameter
.LW *portp

.LW procnum ,
.LW procname
is called with a pointer to its parameter(s);
.LW progname

.LW inproc

This routine returns zero if the registration succeeded, \-1 otherwise.

A macro that destroys the RPC service transport handle,

is undefined after calling this routine.
.SH
svc_fds

A global variable reflecting the RPC service side's
read file descriptor bit mask; it is suitable as a parameter to the

if a service implementor does not call
.LW svc_run() ,
but rather does his own asynchronous event processing.

.BE
This routine is only of interest if a service implementor does not call

but instead implements custom asynchronous event processing.
It is called when the
.LW select()
system call has determined that an RPC request
has arrived on some RPC socket(s);

.BE
Associates
.LW prognum

.LW versnum
with the service dispatch procedure,
.LW dispatch() .
If
.LW protocol
is zero, the service is not registered with the
.I portmap
service.  If
.LW protocol
is non-zero, then a mapping of the triple
.LW [prognum,versnum,protocol]
to
.LW xprt->xp_port
is established with the local
.I portmap
service (generally
.LW protocol
is zero,
.LW IPPROTO_UDP

The procedure
.LW dispatch()
has the following form:
.BS
.LS
	dispatch(request, xprt)

svc_run()
.Lf

The parameter
.LW xprt

void
svcerr_weakauth(xprt)
	SVCXPRT *xprt;

Called by a service dispatch routine that refuses to perform
a remote procedure call due to insufficient (but correct)
authentication parameters.  The routine calls

.SH
svcraw_create()
.LP
.BS
.LS
SVCXPRT *
svcraw_create()
.Lf
.BE
This routine creates a toy RPC service transport,
to which it returns a pointer.  The transport
is really a buffer within the process's address space,
so the corresponding RPC client should live in the same address space; see
.LW clntraw_create() .
This routine allows simulation of RPC and acquisition of RPC overheads
(such as round trip times), without any kernel interference.
This routine returns
.LW NULL
if it fails.

SVCXPRT *
svctcp_create(sock, send_buf_size, recv_buf_size)
	int sock;
	u_int send_buf_size, recv_buf_size;
.Lf
.BE
This routine creates a TCP/IP-based RPC service transport,
to which it returns a pointer.
The transport is associated with the socket
.LW sock ,
which may be
.LW RPC_ANYSOCK ,
in which case a new socket is created.
If the socket is not bound to a local TCP port, then this routine
binds it to an arbitrary port.  Upon completion,
.LW xprt->xp_sock
is the transport's socket number, and
.LW xprt->xp_port
is the transport's port number.
This routine returns
.LW NULL
if it fails.  Since TCP-based RPC uses buffered I/O,
users may specify the size of the
.LW send
and
.LW receive
buffers; values of zero choose suitable defaults.
.SH
svcudp_create()
.LP
.BS
.LS
SVCXPRT *
svcudp_create(sock)
	int sock;
.Lf
.BE
This routine creates a UDP/IP-based RPC service transport,
to which it returns a pointer.
The transport is associated with the socket
.LW sock ,
which may be
.LW RPC_ANYSOCK ,
in which case a new socket is created.
If the socket is not bound to a local UDP port, then this routine
binds it to an arbitrary port.  Upon completion,
.LW xprt->xp_sock
is the transport's socket number, and
.LW xprt->xp_port
is the transport's port number.
This routine returns
.LW NULL
if it fails.
Warning: since UDP-based RPC messages can only hold up to 8 Kbytes
of encoded data, this transport cannot be used for procedures
that take large arguments or return huge results.

The routine returns a pointer
to a contiguous piece of the stream's buffer;
.LW len
is the byte length of the desired buffer.
Note that pointer is cast to
