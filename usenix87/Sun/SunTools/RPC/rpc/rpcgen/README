This directory contains the source for the RPC protocol compiler
`rpcgen.'   Rpcgen allows you to specify the protocol and data types
used for an RPC service in a concise format, and will automatically
generate the various stock components required to make a server for
that service.  See rpcgen.1 for usage information.

The `test' directory contains an example of how rpcgen might be used.

This software is from the Sun Microsystems 3.2Beta software release and
is made available subject to the same conditions as the Remote
Procedure Call library.  Please send comments and bug reports to
sun!rpc or rpc@sun.com.

./xdr_update.c contains two xdr routines which have been added in
3.2 (and which rpcgen uses).  This file may either be loaded with the
server being built (as in the `test' directory), or may be added to the
rpc library.  These routines will be part of the next rpc library
release.
