This is the kit to create a screensaver version of /etc/getty so your
SUN workstation screen don't fry.  The screensaver is composed
of two parts:

	Mods to /etc/getty to specify a 'greeting program' to be executed
	before any prompts are issued.  An example /etc/gettytab entry
	is included.

	A screenholder program that runs the acutal screensaver program
	until interrupted by keyboard input.  A simple manual page
	is included.

While this was done for a SUN workstation, it is trivially portable to
any 4.2BSD-based U-Know-What* and should be easily portable (at least
holdscreen) to most U-Know-What systems.

* Not a trademark of anybody I know of (yet).
