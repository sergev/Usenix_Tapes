[  I generally dislike posting anything other than source code.  In this
   case, however, I'm making an exception because (a) there's no other
   way to do it; and (b) there is apparently a lot of demand for this
   program.  So, I took the object and data files in the fontdir and
   libdir directories and uuencode'd them.  The decode.sh script in the
   toplevel directory will uudecode them and remove the uu.xxx files;
   the lists the files by name, so you can check if you're missing
   something.  This comment will appear at the beginning of each of the
   postings of this program.  --r$  ]
