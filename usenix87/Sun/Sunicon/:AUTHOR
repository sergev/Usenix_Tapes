Here is a simple suntool that displays an icon, whether the
tool is open or closed.  You can display your favorite icons
somewhere on the console screen, without invoking a more CPU
expensive tool. 

Three icons (gort, the robot from the "Day The Earth Stood Still";
marvin, the cute kid from the comic strip by Tom Armstrong; and
the bat signal from the "Batman" TV series") are enclosed.

If you have an "Odie" plush toy on your desk, or if you hang
fuzzy dice from the rearview mirror of your car, you'll
probably enjoy this program!

This program was compiled and installed on both a Sun 2 and
Sun 3 running 3.0.
