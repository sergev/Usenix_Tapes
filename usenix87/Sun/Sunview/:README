Here is a program (+ makefile and manual page) called "sunview" which
allows you to view a halftone rendition of a raster "image" file on
a SUN running suntools.  It is meant to run in a "gfx-window".  The
input image file should be 1 byte per pixel.  Number of rows and
columns are set in the command line.

Happy viewing!
