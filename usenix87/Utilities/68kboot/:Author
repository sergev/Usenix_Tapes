You expressed interest in a 68000 system monitor.  Here is one I wrote for my
CompuPro 68000.  It isn't very pretty, but it does work.  Its most interesting
characteristic is that it will work without ANY memory working.  It may thus
be used to bring up a system that much easier.  I hope you can make some use
of it.  (P.S. this is only part of the original ROM, so there may be a few
undefined symbols.  This part is the non-disk non-BIOS part though).
