Archive-name: append

Here is a shar archive of the program "append", which fixes a small
security hole for large unix sites.  The files "append.c" and
"append.1" are necessary, the rest (secur.r, append.web and append.r)
are merely of interest:

 1) Source for append in C (the output of TANGLE, edited
    for readability by humans. See 5, below).
 2) The man-page for append(1) in nroff input format.
 3) An essay on security -vs- freedom to donate programs
    on a multi-user site.
 4) The WEB input form of append (which was written in C
    using Knuth's WEB "literate programming" system)
 5) The nroff input form of append (after processing with
    WEAVE), suitable for nroff -ms for a programming logic
    manual.
