Here's an alternative to `asroot.'  This is a small program which does
nothing more than exec a shell (typically csh, for me) with exactly
those arguments with which it was called.  I have this on multi-user
systems, but it lives in a private bin directory with mode 700, so no
one but me can get at it unless they're already root or me.

Typical usage is
	% enable
which gives me a plain root shell, or
	% enable -fc 'some random single command to be executed'
