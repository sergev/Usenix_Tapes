We have a useful command called "sudo", which verifies a
user is allowed to execute a command as root, and keeps
records of sudo usage. 

/usr/local/adm/sudoers contains a list of superusers and
their sudo priveleges.  If a user is listed in sudoers, and
the user is permitted to execute a command, the command is
executed with root's ownership. 

Permissions in sudoers are either "all", a list of commands,
an enviornment PATH variable, or a PATH followed by a list
of commands.

A record of sudo usage is kept in sudo.log, and a record
of non-superuser attempts to sudo is kept in sudo.log.failures.

Sudo with no command to execute just shows your sudo permission.

Sudo must be installed setuid root.
