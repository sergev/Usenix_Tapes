Several weeks ago, I posted source for the at(1) command. There were
several problems with it, especially on Sys V machines (such as the
AT&T 7300 I write it on): by 'chown'ing an at file to 'root', the file
would be run by 'at' with super-user permissions. I have fixed this
problem, and several others, in the new version below. Moreover, rather
than supplying a 'makefile' that automatically installs the command,
I have merely included written instructions on what to do (in the
original, the 'make install' option clobbered /usr/lib/crontab); if
something goes wrong in the installation, at least it won't be my
fault.
