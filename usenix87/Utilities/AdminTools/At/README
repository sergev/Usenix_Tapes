#	NEW FEATURES!!!!!
#
#	1. no longer will the error file ATRUN.ERR get filled up with
#	   messages saying 'there aren't any files to run'.
#
#	2. a file in the AT directory will not be run if its owner has
#		been changed since its creation; thus, users can no longer
#		'chown' their at files to root. however, they may make changes
#		to their own at files without endangering the jobs.
#
#	3. files in the AT directory are in the form YYDDD.HHMMC, where C
#		is a letter which distinguishes between files with the same
#		time.

#  to set up 'at' on your AT&T Unix PC, do the following:
#
#	0. make sure that the files 'at.c', 'atrun.c', 'at.h' and 'at'
#		are all in the current directory.
#
#	1. make both 'at.exe' and 'atrun' by typing 			
#		make at
#
#	2. put 'at.exe' and 'at' in /usr/bin, changing the owner and group
#		of 'at' to bin and making it executable by all. change the
#		owner of 'at.exe' to root, and set the mode to 4755, so that
#		it sets effective user-id to root upon execution by anyone.
#
#	3. put 'atrun' in /usr/lib, changing the owner and group to root
#		and mode to 700.
#
#	4. insert the following line in /usr/lib/crontab: (without the '#')
#	 	change the first group of digits to taste. remember that the more
#		often 'atrun' runs, the more likely that it will be running
#		when the power goes out - and then you get a head crash.
#
#		0,15,30,45 * * * * /bin/su root -c "/usr/lib/atrun > /dev/null"
#
#	5. save the sources, the documentation and this file in a safe
#		place, perhaps /usr/src/at.
