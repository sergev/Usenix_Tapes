.SH NAME
.PP
at - run commands via
.IR sh (1)
at a later time
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
At has two forms:
.IP
at time weekday [ week ] [ file ]
.IP
at time month day_of_month [ file ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.I At
takes commands from the given file (standard input default) and runs
them via
.IR sh (1)
at the time specified by its arguments. Input and output are lost
unless redirected. The 
.I time 
argument consists of up to four digits
and an optional trailing 'A' (for AM), 'P' (for PM), 'N' (for noon)
or 'M' for midnight. If one or two digits are present, 
both are assumed to be hours; if three or four,
the first one or two are hours,
the last two minutes. If no 'A' or 'P' is supplied, twenty-four
hour time is assumed. With no further arguments, the next occurence of
the given time (later today or tomorrow) is used.
.PP
The
.I weekday
argument specifies one of the seven calendar weekdays by name; either
upper or lower case may be used, with only enough letters to uniquely
identify one. If the word
.I week
follows, the date is moved seven days into the future.
.PP
The 
.I month
argument specifies one of the twelve months by name, again in either
or lower case, with the following argument supplying the day of that
month during which execution is desired. If 
.I month
is earlier than the current month, or the same and 
.I day_of_month
earlier the current day, a date in the next calendar year is used.
.SH OPERATION
.PP
.I At
creates a file which switches to the current directory
and sets up the current environment before executing the user's
comamnds. Actual execution is carried out by /usr/lib/atrun,
invoked every so often by an entry in the file /usr/lib/crontab.

.SH DIAGNOSTICS
.PP
All error messages produced by 
.I at
appear on the user's terminal, while those produced by 
.I atrun
are place in the file /usr/spool/at/ATRUN.ERR.
.SH BUGS
.PP
The granularity of
.IR cron (1)
means that commands will be executed only within some reasonable
period (usually fifteen minutes) after the exact time given.
.PP
.I At
is very stupid about dates and
times - it does not check them for validity. Thus,
.IP
at 499 jan 88
.PP
will cause no warnings or error messages, just a file that will run
on the 88th day after January first at 99 minutes past four AM.
