[ I have included part of the description from the original release of
  mdump for those who may not have seen the first release.  Note that this
  is an UPDATE, there are files and programs that are not included with
  this module - contact me to obtain the original distribution.

This revision incorporates suggestions contributed from the net as
well as some code cleanup engendered from a fresh look at the 
program.

The dump level for dailies and weeklies can now be specified with the
dl or wl switches.  Omitting them causes 5 and 4 to be used as the 
default level (set by #define's).

The somewhat awkward use of #define's to group printf strings together
has been eliminated in preference for moving the strings to where they're
used.  The comment  /* EDIT THIS */  now flags the location of site-
dependent strings.

Re-structuring the code inflated the patch file to be larger than the
original.  Included is the new mdump.c and mdump.8 man page.

Release 2.5 of OSx for the Pyramid 90x has changed the exit code of a
successful dump from 1 to 0.  Either revise dump.h and recompile dump,
or change mdump to check for 0 rather than 1.
