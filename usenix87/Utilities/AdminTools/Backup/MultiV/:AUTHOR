	[ This is a program that was announced in net.unix-wizards
	  some time ago (May perhaps).  It reads standard input
	  and splits the (assumed large) file across multiple
	  tape volumes.  It does some label checking on tapes.

	  I have tested this to the extent of seeing that it compiles,
	  and runs its own test cases, on both 4.3beta and Sys V.
	  To compile this on Sys V you will need to add
		  -Dindex=strchr -DSYSV
	  on the DEFINE= line in Makefile.

	  You should read the Makefile carefully, there are some system
	  dependant defines scattered through it.  Also read the READ_ME
	  carefully.
