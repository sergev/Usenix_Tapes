	Multivol V1.00 - multivolume backup utility

========================================================================
To install :-
	0) check Makefile
		- sorry you'll find a lot of testing junk - see below.
	1) make depend
		- to build dependencies in makefile 
		- check them at the end of the Makefile.
	2) make multivol
	3) Test writting to a file (i.e. not a device)
		3.0) make testdata - to build a test data program.
		3.1) make wfile - test writting to file
			The first time a file or device is written to
			multivol will report that it finds no header.
		3.2) make rfile - test reading the file.
		3.3) make rewfile - test writting and re-reading the file.
	4) Test writting to a device.
		4.0) Change TSTDEV in makefile to the device used for testing.
		     or better - create the link /dev/multivol to the device.
		     This is compiled into multivol as the default device.
		4.1 - 4.3) Simple tests are 'make w', 'make r', 'make ro'
		4.4) Have a look at Makefile to try some other tests (e.g wbig)
	End)
		E.0) Change DEFINE in Makefile to not include -DDEBUG
		     This ensures tracing is removed from object code.
		E.1) Change CFLAGS in Makefile to include -O
			(if you have an optimising compiler)
		E.2) make clobber - to remove any object code.
		E.3) make multivol - to rebuild the thing without any tracing.
		E.4) If it still works (i.e. you can trust your optimiser)
		     install it in you favourite bin directory and
		     multivol.8 in /usr/man/man8 or wherever.

	Using /dev/rmt0, doesn't appear to read volume header unless
	the block size matches the written block size.  I/O failure.
