Backup is a front-end for 4.[23]bsd dump, allowing non-programmers to
successfully run disk-to-tape backups.  It incorporates what seems to
be a sufficient amount of paranoid thinking to prevent data-destroying
blunders.  I'm sending this out partially because I feel it could be of
some use, and partially because I'm interested in seeing what
[constructive] comments we'll receive; we're considering some changes
in the way we do backups.

Note that this program is NOT a standalone backup program; it has never
been tested with anything other than 4.2BSD and 4.3BSD dump.
