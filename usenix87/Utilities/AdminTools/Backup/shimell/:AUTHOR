	I enclose a dump script which we run every night via crontab.
	The script runs on BSD4.2 and does an incremental dump level 6
	Mon-Thu and a level 3 on Fri.  Once a month we do a manual
	level 0.  Yes, I know this is a trivial command script to write
	but how many of you still labour with manual dumps?

	Operation is simple.  a) load tape before going home, b) remove
	tape in morning! 

	All file systems are dumped to a single tape therefore you have
	to "mt fsf n" to the correct file system before restore.

	Bugs: 
		- If the dumps require more than a single tape, the
		  last dump must be aborted and manually restarted.
		  (I guess the script could keep track of the amount
		  of tape used in previous dump run.)  As the script
		  is reading /dev/console, you have to compete with
		  getty to talk to dump.

		- There is a check for machine stc-b (6250 bpi), you
		  may have to change this line if you use a 6250 bpi
		  tape drive.  Any one know of a better way of finding
		  out the tape density?

		- The hostname call fails when single user.
