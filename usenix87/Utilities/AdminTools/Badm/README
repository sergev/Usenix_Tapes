badm Rev 2.0						31-Oct-85

The "badm" utility is a formater for certain MASSBUS disks, operating
under full multi-user timesharing 4.2bsd Vax system.  This software
has been placed in the public domain, for the benefit of all Vax
4.2bsd sites.  The following files are included in this distribution:

	badm.c		C source code for badm utility
	badm.8		Manual entry for badm - READ THIS FIRST!
	hp.diffs	Additions/differences to vaxmba/hp.c
	dkio.add	Additions to vax/dkio.h

Installation consists of some minor additions and modifications to the
4.2bsd MASSBUS disk driver (vaxmba/hp.c) and some additions to the
disk ioctl header file (vax/dkio.h).  badm will *not* work without
these changes to the 4.2bsd kernel.

To install:
	1.  Read hp.diffs and dkio.add, and make coding changes
	    specified therein.
	2.  Recompile kernel and boot it.
	3.  Compile badm.c.
	4.  READ MANUAL ENTRY BEFORE USING badm.

This is the 2.0 revision of badm, supporting the following disks:
	RM05  RM03  Eagle  RP06  RP05  RP04

Additional disks can be supported by adding entries to the disktypes[]
table in badm.c (this may also require a new whdr_XXX() subroutine,
depending upon the header design of the target disk).
