	I ran across the following shell script which does a nice job
of providing the much missed batch command on the AT&T UNIX PC.  The
original file (below the cut line) is pretty much self explanatory.

	I hope others find it as useful as I do.  I would also be
interested in any feedback on this file or the availability of other
goodies for the PC 7300.
