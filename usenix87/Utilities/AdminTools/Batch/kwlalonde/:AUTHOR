Batch allows you to run resource-intensive jobs with mimimum impact on
other users, without going out of your way.  Batch submits a shell
script to a queue for execution by a daemon.  Each queue has a
"profile" file describing its characteristics.  Here is the profile for
our "troff" queue, with comments in ():

	nice 2		(nice jobs +2)
	maxexec 1	(run at most one at a time)
	mail ec		(mail submitter when job is done, or if crash)
	supervisor /usr/spool/batch/troff/This_week	(see "man batchd")
	mailsupervisor sec	(see "man batchd")
	loadsched 10	(don't schedule jobs if load average > 10)
	loadstop 14	(stop running jobs if l.a. > 14)
	restart		(restart after crash)
	rlimitcpu 1800	(various 4.2BSD resource limits)
	rlimitfsize 10000000
	rlimitcore 0
	rlimitrss 50000
We use batch to run most troff's, and some special
purpose things like image processing and simulations.

The original author is Alex White (watmath!mks!alex).
The code is written for 4.2BSD.  Comments welcome.
