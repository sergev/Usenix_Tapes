<eat me>
	Here is a batch system for BSD4.2 written by Bruce Ollie Munro.
	(I am posting it as he is currently away on a course - please
	address flames etc to ollie@stc.UUCP)

	The batch system uses the line printer queueing system to do
	the hard work.  This has the advantages of using standard
	software to control queues.  Thus batch queues may be
	manipulated by lpc.

	We have run this batch system for a number of months with no
	problems.  Please note that the Makefile is an augmented Make
	so this may not work on your system.  To install for the first
	time type:

		make new	(as root)

	May I suggest that if your system is greatly loaded then you
	should think about running the load contol software distributed over
	the net recently from San Diego.  We run it in addition to batch
	and are greatly impressed!
