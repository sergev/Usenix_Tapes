This directory contains the source code and man page for "cfs", a program that
checks file states on 4.2/4.3 BSD Unix systems.  Cfs has been tested on a VAX
750 4.2/4.3 BSD system, and a Sun 100U running Sun Unix version 2.  Cfs can
check the states of over 60 files per CPU second on either system.

You should be able to type:

  make
  make test
  make install
  make clean

You'll probably want to edit the Makefile before you type "make install".
You must install the man entry by hand.

System managers should use cfs to check almost all files in the following
directories:

  /
  /etc
  /bin
  /lib
  /usr
  /usr/bin
  /usr/ucb
  /usr/lib
  /usr/include
  /usr/src
  /usr/local/bin  -  or any other dirs in most everyone's path

Gradually, you can weed out the volatile files.  Don't forget to add "hidden"
files starting with ., etc., that *'s don't pick up.  I have crontab run cfs
every night and mail the results to root.

If you make useful changes to cfs, particularly if you port cfs to System V,
please mail the changes back to me.
