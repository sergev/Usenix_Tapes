[ moderator's note:  I have had SEVERAL people send mail indicating
  security problems with the original chsh,chfn.  This is the only mail
  I recieve that contained code fixes.  I have not tried to verify that
  THIS version is secure - but it appears to be MUCH better than the
  original.                         John Nelson, moderator
