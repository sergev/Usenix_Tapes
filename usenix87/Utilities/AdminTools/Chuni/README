	Here is a program to let users change their default login universe.
It's Pyramid specific and is used in a fashion similar to ``chsh''.

	This program was written very early on and as much as anything was
really to play with file locking and with universes.  It has been used on
our Pyramid for nearly 18 months and hasn't been changed in over 12 months.

	The major problem with it is that it relies on the Universe name
being only three characters long.  If this ever changes (and it probably
will) then the program will have to be rewritten.

	To use it just compile and install it setuid root.  See the
accompanying Makefile.

	Any bugs or problems let me know.
