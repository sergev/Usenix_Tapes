This script prints nice summaries of people's disk usage, as they change
from day-to-day and week-to-week.  The sample shown below is somewhat off,
because I just ran the thing twice to get two reports.  I lifted this from
a source that would rather remain anonymous.  I did some hacking to make
it more efficient (e.g., the "eval" stuff).
