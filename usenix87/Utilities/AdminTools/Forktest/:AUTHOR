Archive-name: forktest

I would like to submit the following program to mod.sources.  I hope
that the comments are sufficient explanation.  I don't see that a
manual is worthwhile.

I have run this program under System V and Version 7.  I have not
tested it under BSD, but I know of no impediment.

With this program, I have found bugs in a number of UNIX System V
utilities.  I am sure that BSD programs would be just as buggy, but
I haven't tested them.  Here are some examples:

Programs that leave extra file descriptors open:
     sdb ! command
     mailx ~! command during message composition, and ! command (two extra)
     mail ! command
     rn ! or | command (5 extra!)
     cu ~! command (one extra: number 5)

Programs that leave signals ignored:
     mailx ~! command (SIGINT!)
     rn ! and | commands (SIGEMT!?)

I think that this list shows that it is easy to get fork(2) wrong.
I hope programmers will use ForkTest to catch this type of bug
early.  Exercise for the reader: what can you scribble on with those
extra file descriptors?
