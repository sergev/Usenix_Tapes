To all who have IBM PC or XT (maybe AT) with an AST SixPak expansion
card with onboard clock/calendar and running VENIX/86 (TM VenturCom)
operating system:

	The following program will free you from setting date and time
	manually everytime you boot the system.  Just follow the 
	directions below on how to use it and you are off and running.

NOTE:	No matter which hardware your system is running on, make sure
	that the AST  port addresses on your card are the same as in
	the defines below, if not then it is easy to modify the defines.

My next project will be a change to VENIX boot record so that by
typing "dos" to the ampersand (&) prompt at boot time, the PC-DOS
will be booted from its partition on the C disk (if there is any).
So far by setting the dos partition active has not worked and I don't
know of any other way of booting dos from the hard disk partition;
does anybody???  Another project I would love to do is to provide
access to PC-DOS files on the hard disk C partition, but this is tricky.
As far as running PC-DOS programs under VENIX, I would suggest looking
at VenturCom's CONNECTOR.  Thats All Folks!  Enjoy the program!!

PS:	It is not in any special format, just cut at the dashed line
	below and that is it.
