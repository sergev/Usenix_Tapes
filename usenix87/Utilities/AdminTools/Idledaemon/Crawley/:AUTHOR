This posting contains the source and manual entry for a daemon for
managing a pool of terminal ports to try to make sure that there
will be free one when it is needed.  It does this by checking for
sessions that have had no input, and that have no active processes.
When there is a shortage of ports, some or all of these sessions are
sent warning messages, and if necessary killed off.  

The program is 4.2 specific, since (for example) it grubs around in 
the process table to determine whether a session has active processes.

To compile the program, feed the stuff below the dotted line into /bin/sh,
then type
		cc idledaemon

If you want to see what the program is up to, compile it with the DEBUG
flag set, and it will tell all on stderr.

Read the manual entry, to find out about the various parameters you can
tweak, then run the daemon.  I recommend that before you install it for
real, you run the program with the -d option for a few days to get your 
users used to the idea.  

We have been running the daemon for a few weeks now, but bugs are still
jumping out occasionally.  Please send any bug reports, suggestions for 
changes and so on to me at the address below.
