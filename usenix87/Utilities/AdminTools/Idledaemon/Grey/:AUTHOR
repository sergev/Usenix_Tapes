The following program  will kick users off of the system if their
idle time exceeds a specified number of minutes.  The program checks
for "silent" processes, so as to not terminate a connection just because
no I/O to the terminal had taken place.  Our system is set up with
customer user ID's and group ID's starting at 100.  This way, certain
users can be made exempt from the idledaemon.  Another site specific
item in the program is the location of the dialup lines, since console 
and hardwire ports are exempt.
