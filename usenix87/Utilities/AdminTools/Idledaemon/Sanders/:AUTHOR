I'm reposting the following for two reasons:  someone asked for it,
but I couldn't reply, and a minor modification (see 5/85 entry) is
helpful to those with paging in the kernal, or lots of terminals with HOLD
keys.

-----
The following is a shell script/crontab line we've had running for more
than a year.  We have about 24 ports and about 100 terminals meeting at
a nicely wood-crafted plugboard, so contention is a problem.  Sorry, no
man page for this one - but carefully note the bug comment.
This works for us on VAX/4.2 BSD, and SUN 1/4.2 BSD.  Note that the
"echo -n" lines are supposed to have control-G's between the "".
I don't know if they will make it past various mailers.
