Dear Moderator,

Please find within the source code for a daemon I have been running for
more than 6 months without problems on our 4.2BSD system. It simply
logs off idle users afer giving them fair warning. See comments at the
start of the code for more details.

I wrote this thing after I noticed the some users never logged off.  I
have seen similar things on the net before, but they all seemed rather
complicated, whereas this thing is very simple and easy to use and
configure.  Maybe the config data should be read from a file, I thought
of this but felt that the thing is so seldom reconfigured that this
seemed unecessary. Have not put in any comments about this being public
domain etc, but of course anyone can use this exactly as they want as
far as I am concerned.
