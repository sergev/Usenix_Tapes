I wrote this program after a couple of days in a row of news
arriving and being unbatched during the day.  News unbatching
doesn't mix well with troffing and macsyma.  Our poor 750 was
at load averages hardly ever seen before (~20!).

This is a modified form of our play program.  It sits above
the program and monitors the load average.  If the load average
gets high it nices the process group.  If the load average comes
back down the nice goes down also.  After a couple of days of use
this looks like a useful program.  


Sigh!  I know....  post it to net.sources.4bsd.  Well, there aint
one, so there!   (phthththth)  (We need a little icon for raspberries)
