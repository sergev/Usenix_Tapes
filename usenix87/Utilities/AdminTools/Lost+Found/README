Here's something that people may find useful:  a shell script for
scrounging around in fsck ``lost+found'' directories and telling
people about newly found files.  Basically, you invoke it by running
it in the lost+found directory.

This works under 4.1BSD.  You might have to change the names assumed
by the awk script for other Unixes; I don't know whether all fsck's
are alike.

For example, we have the following in our /etc/rc:

-------------------------this goes in /etc/rc---------------------------
                                echo notifying about files >/dev/console
	for lfdir in /lost+found /*/lost+found
	do
	    if [ $lfdir != /tmp/lost+found ]
	    then
		(cd $lfdir; /etc/recover_notify)	   >/dev/console 2>&1
	    fi
	done
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now (fanfare) here's /etc/recover_notify:

---------------------this goes in /etc/recover_notify-------------------
d=`pwd`
ls -l |\
awk ' {\
    if ( length( $3 ) > 0 && length( $8 ) > 0 && substr ($8, 1, 2) != "##") {\
	print "mail " $3 " << XXXXXXX" ;\
	print "To: " $3 ; \
	print "A file of yours was recovered and placed in '$d'/#" $8 "." ;\
	print "XXXXXXX" ;\
	print "echo Notifying " $3 " about file '$d'/" $8 "\\" ;\
	print "mv \\" $8 " \\#" $8 ;\
    }\
}' |\
sh
