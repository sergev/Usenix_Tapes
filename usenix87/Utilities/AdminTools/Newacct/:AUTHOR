# Newacct is a program that creates an "account request" form,
# has the user fill it out, then sends mail off to someone to
# get the account installed.  We use it for account requests on
# our local machines.  It could certainly be fancier, but it
# works well enough as is.
#
# No manual entry (sorry), but the program is self explanatory.
# You will need 4.2BSD (or remove the gethostname() system calls)
# and the Maryland Window Library to run it (or convert it to
# curses).
#
# It also uses the error() routine we have in our C library.  I've
# included the Vax/Sun/NS32000 version with the rest of the code.
