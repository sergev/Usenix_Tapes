DESCRIPTION
	Newspace(1) reports the disk space used by Usenet newsgroups.
	It is more intellegent than a du(1) of the directories of the
	newsgroups; see the man page for details.

CONFIGURATION EXPECTATIONS
	The shell script is set up for the default news configuration;
	however, if yours is different, inspect the shell script's use
	of the environment variables "newsdir" and "active", which
	give the directory under which the newsgroups are and the
	location of the active file.

SYSTEM EXPECTATIONS
	The shell script by default uses the System V cut(1) and xargs(1)
	commands; if you don't have cut(1), some commented-out code is
	provided to imitate its function.  Edit accordingly.

	A public domain xargs(1) has been distributed separatedly
	for non-System V Unixes.  As with cut(1), some
	commented-out code in the shell script is provided to imitate
	xargs if you don't have it (although use of xargs is encouraged!).

COMMENT
	One notable feature of this shell script is that it contains the
	longest pipeline-command I think I have ever seen; all the work
	is done, in fact, by a single pipeline.

HISTORY
	The original newspace was written by me and distributed to
	the San Francisco Bay Area sites via ba.news in January, 1986,
	partly for testing purposes.  David St. Pierre (ptsfa!dsp)
	suggested some improvements and enhancements (thanks, David),
	which are included here.  Before it's posting to mod.sources,
	John P. Nelson (panda!jpn) provided an alternative for the
	xargs usage (thanks, John).

BUGS
	I have no bugs to report; however I would like to hear of any
	bugs or enhancements for this shell script, and any comments
	and improvements for the manual page.  (One obvious enhancement,
        perhaps, is for newspace to report the size of particular
        newsgroups, instead of all of them at once).
