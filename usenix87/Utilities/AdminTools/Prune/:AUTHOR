John,

The following is a program I wrote to "prune" log files.  The purpose
of this is to keep files that keep getting larger from getting too
large.  I became annoyed at having to search and remember where these
files are, then make them smaller by hand, every time disk space gets
tight.  I also didn't like the idea of having a separate cron entry for
every log file I wanted to deal with.

While prune is not extremely robust, it is very functional.  It
compiles and runs as is under 4.2BSD.  I have not tested it under
System * or Xenix, however I believe it should run as is or with little
modification.
