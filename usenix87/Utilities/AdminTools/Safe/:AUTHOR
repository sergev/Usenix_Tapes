[ Between an amazingly massive work crunch, and the replacement or exchange
  of both our minicomputers, there has been no mod.sources postings for almost
  a month.  Sorry.  For this program, I wrote a Makefile and tweaked the
  manpage a bit.  --r$ ]

I thought I'd send this in since there has been some discussion about this
sort of program.  I have tested/used it on SYS V r2.  It *should* be portable,
though.
