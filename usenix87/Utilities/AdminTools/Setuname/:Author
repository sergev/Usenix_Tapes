There has been some discussion lately on uucp problems on Sys V machines
that do not have properly set nodenames.  The following program has been
tested ONLY on NCR Towers but should be easily modified to handle other
systems.

The program needs a namelist (the disk version of the kernel that you are
running) and permits you to change any or all of the utsname structure
(nodename, machine, system, version, and release) in either the namelist
or in the running kernel or in both.  The structure in "/unix" is found
by looking into the symbol table (COFF assumed) and computing the correct
offset.  The address is also used as the offset into "/dev/kmem" to find
the structure, but before writing into kmem the structure is read and 
compared to the results of a uname() call.

Please send me any fixes or portability improvements.
