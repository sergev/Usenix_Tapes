Untamo is a locally developed daemon which periodically wakes up and
logs off idle terminals; it also can deal with multiply-logged in
users.  It is configurable without recompilation, and features tunable
parameters such as maximum allowed idle time, maximum allowable
multiple logins, exemption lists, and so on.  (Note: session limits
do not work at the moment.)

We use this program to ensure availability of one of our scarcer
resources: terminals.  Others may find it useful for different reasons;
preventing users from leaving a terminal logged-in and unattended
for hours is probably a reasonable security measure.

The original posting caused a deluge of mail, as the sources contained
references to local include files.  This has been fixed by #ifdef'ing
the code which applies only locally.  This version has been successfully
compiled on a Sequent Balance 21000 running Dynix v2.0.6, a CCI 6/32
running 4.3bsd, a DEC VAX-8600 running 4.3bsd, a Gould PowerNode 9080
Running UTX-32 Release 1.3, and and a VAX-11/780 running 4.2bsd.

Please address correspondence concerning untamo to "doc" on this machine;
the original author has left Purdue, but Craig Norborg (aka "doc") is
reasonably familiar with the program.
