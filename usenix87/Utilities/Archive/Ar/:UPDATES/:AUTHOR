After I posted my patch to unpar for System V compatability
I recieved a nice letter telling me that this patch wouldn't work
if the filename was a full pathname, i.e. "tmp/foo/file".

Absolutely, right, but ar uses basenames, so the filename should
only be a filename. So I got out my patching kit and patched arwrite.c
so that:
	1. Only the basename is uplaced in the header.
	2. The filename is truncated to the proper length.

I also repatched unpar.c so only the last '/' on a filename is removed,
to preserve some measure of sanity relative to the original par.

Below is the patch to arwrite.c, my old patch to the original unpar.c
and an upgrade patch to the latest unpar.c. Hopefully, this way people
who installed the original, can deinstall it and install the new patch.
