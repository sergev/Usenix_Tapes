These programs pack and unpack files in the portable archive format.
This format is compatible with the ar command on 4BSD and System V
release 2.  These programs are available for use by anyone without
fee or license.

The par program packs into portable archive format.  The files to
write are named on the command line, the resulting archive is
written on stdout:
	par file1 file2 ... filen > files.a

The unpar program unpacks from stdin and writes the named files
out directly:
	unpar < files.a
