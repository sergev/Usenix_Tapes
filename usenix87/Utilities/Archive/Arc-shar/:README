WARNING!!!

Although I've managed to get this running on a 68k Unisoft (sys 5) box,
the code is not thoroughly tested.  I *do* know that it will handle
crunched files and am pretty sure packed also.  Some of the other formats
have not been tested although it probably works.  This program makes
assumptions about sizeof and endedness.  It was written for CI-C86
(8086 architecture) where sizeof and endedness is different for just about any
datatype than on a 68k box.  Since it works at all, I've probably caught most
(all?) of the dependencies.  The troublesome code is mostly (all?) in
arcunix.c which replaces arcdos.mac and arcdir.mac.  I've done the
typedefs for this machine only, but porting to others should now be
simple.  The most troublesome part is dealing with the arc headers
as you have to read the header into a buffer and parse it into a
structure.  I have, of course, converted the source to *not* need the
obscure macro processor.  The orriginal arcdos.mac and arcdir.mac are
included at the end of this for the sake of completeness.  They are not
converted.  I *have not* tried to get marc or xarc going although the
Makefile would lead you to believe otherwise.  They're of little use under
unix anyway.  Thanks to the poster of tm_to_time.c (included also) as
this is necessary for the time/date conversions between dos/unix.  Sorry
I can't remember who it was.

Some notes towards a UNIX version of ARC:

1.  These sources represent the MS-DOS version of ARC.  As such, they have a
    few of the MS-DOS limitations, i.e., eight-letter filenames with a three-
    letter extension, limited use of pathnames, and assumption of a single-
    user, single task OS.  It would be nice to address these limitations
    for a UNIX version.

2.  The sources are not, strictly speaking, C sources.  They need to be
    preprocessed by a macro preprocesser.  The preprocessor used to produce
    them is called MACRO, and is a commercial product of SEA, the producers
    of ARC.  It should be a simple task to fake it, though, as the preprocessor
    does not appear to have been used extensively.
