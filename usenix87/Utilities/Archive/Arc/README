ARC  -  For Unix System V

This version is based upon a version that was posted to net.sources for
BSD.  This program DOES NOT suffer from core dumps!  After looking at
the code for BSD I understand why there were core dumps in the first
place.  The BSD version is based upon IBM PC ARC 5.12.  I tried to
maintain backwards compatability with the original PC ARC, but, the
BSD version I got, only made a half-hearted attempt at it, commenting
out entire sections, and deleting sections of the MSDOS version.  After
looking at the BSD version, I decided in favor of NOT attemping to
remain backwards compatable with it.  Maybe some can clean up the code
and make it work under both systems, and send diffs, or the program back
