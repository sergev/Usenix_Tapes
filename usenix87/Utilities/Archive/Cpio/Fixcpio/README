This is a program for fixing broken cpio -c archives.  It is commonly
used to recover a backup when disk 10 from a 30 disk archive has gotten
trashed.

It is often the "help" required by "Out of phase--get help."

To compile, either go:

	cc -O fixcpio.c -o fixcpio
	
or on System V say:

	make fixcpio	

-dB
