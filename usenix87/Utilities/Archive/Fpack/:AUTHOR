The following program is similar to the shar archiver used to
send files over the net.  One thing I like about shar is that
the recipient only needs the Bourne shell to unpack a bunch of
files, making shell archives a great way to send files to UNIX
machines.  fpack was created to transfer files between machines
where one or both does not have sh.  It is like programs like
tar or cpio that pack and unpack their own archives, but fpack
is more portable, and not something I mind posting to the net,
because I wrote it.  The version here is very simple--it transfers
only plain text files, not directories--but it helped me transfer
100 files to MSDOS and unpack them there (ie, it simplified the
transfer because I could only transfer one file at a time and preferred
to transfer one huge file).  fpack can also be used to save space
because it can place several files in one file.  It is also pretty
safe because it does not code the files; if all else fails, you
can unpack an archive file using a text editor.

Example:
	fpack *.c > archive    -- creates the archive
	rm *.c                 -- get rid of the old files
	transfer archive       -- transfer archive
	fpack < archive        -- unpack archive and create files
