As the final header comment indicates, this is a modification of a script
I posted a while back that includes the capability to traverse directories.
It seems to work very well, and I am posting it in response to some discussion
in net.sources.d about multi-part shar files.  I hope that it will satisfy the
needs of those who have the problem.

[ I would be particularly interested in a /bin/sh or C version of
  this that everyone could use.  I somehow think it would make my
  job a little easier.  Steven's original version was posted in
  mod.sources Vol2#16.  Note that this version supports up to 10
  kits, or 640K of source; just barely big enough for hack.  --r$]
