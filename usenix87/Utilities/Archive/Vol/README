This distribution contains the first release of the `vol' command,
which creates volume header files for multivolume `tar' archives.
A man page is included.

The following items may be of interest for porting:

	1.  It was compiled undex XENIX 3.0 originally.
	2.  My compiler has the 8-character limit on names.
	3.  I used upper and lowercase in names.
	4.  It reads directories and uses stat(2) and time(2).

Here's my copy of /etc/default/vol:
# tape/disk volume sizes
VOLSIZE=1400
DISKSIZE=1400
TAPESIZE=60000

I'd be very interested in hearing any comments, and of course I'd
appreciate receiving any modifications, bug fixes, ports, etc.
