After all the discussion about a "bug" in unix cal, I decided to post
this version.  It compiles both in the unix environment and under
MSDOS using Lattice C (with a little .ASM assist).  It folds years
between 13 and 99 into the twentieth century, and recognizes months
either by name or number.

Included is the source and uuencoded MSDOS executable.

Usage:	cal [m] [y]
	'm' is 1 thru 12 or any reasonable month name.
	'y' is a year between 100 and 9999.
	Years 13-99 are abbreviations for 1913-1999.
	With no arguments, the current year is printed.
	With only a month given, the next instance of
		that month (this year or next) is printed.
	Year as a single argument gives that whole year.
