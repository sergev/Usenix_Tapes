This is the source to a program called 'calend'.  'calend' reminds
you of scheduled events from a dates file.  It is similar to 'calendar',
but is more general, including reminders for weekly, bi-weekly, monthly
etc. events, automatic cleaning up, of one-time-only events, and even telling
you to get off the terminal at a certain time.  It uses another enclosed
program called 'remind', which is like 'leave', but also uses a message
telling you what you have to leave for.  It can remind you by mail as well
as just by printing out messages.  To make it, cut below the dotted line and
run the file as 'sh <file>' in a clean directory.  Any comments, criticism,
complaints, bug fixes, enhancements, etc. to umcp-cs!israel.  Enjoy it.
