This directory contains the source for two programs; 
	1) calend - an appointment calendar maintainer
	2) remind - a program that reminds you to log off the
		    system and why;

Calend is a program that takes apointments specified in a .calrc
and notifies the user about them when the user wants to be notified.
An example .calrc is as follows:

: print out a message about bill's party on July 21 the week
: before it; delete when done.
ad	*-7	7/21		Party at bill's on %2
: tell me by mail the week before the monthly rent is due.
m	*-7	{jan - dec} 1	%m2's Rent is due
: remind me to get off the system for math class every mon wed and fri at 2.
r	{mon wed fri}	*	1400 Go to math class
: the week before its due, tell me about my insurance payment once
1	*-7	{jan 12, apr 14, sept 15, dec 10}  insurance payment by %2
: tell me on the next payday, and then move the message forward two weeks.
: (i.e. tell me about bi-weekly paydays)
a+	sept 23	*	+14 Payday today

In addition, there is a shell script here called 'addcal' which makes
it a little easier to add an entry to your .calrc.

The remind program nags you to get off the system at some time.  An example
call is:
	remind 1830 'go home for dinner'
which will nag you to get off the system for dinner at 6:30pm.  This
program is a modification of the 'leave' program.

To install:

1) First modify the variable LOCDIR in the file "Makefile"
   to reflect, where on your system the executables should go.

2) Next, modify the config file globals.h to indicate where you chose
   to store the "remind" executable.

3) run 'make inst-all' which will make and install the executables and
   the manual entries.
