This is part one of my calendar generation program.  This
file contains all of the source code and the next one contains
the data file.  This program works on 4.1/4.2 BSD on a VAX and
on a PYRAMID.  It has never been tested on any other systems
because I don't have access to any other systems.  It should
work fine fine on system III/V if you compile with -Dindex=strchr.
If you have any problems porting it to other systems let me know
and I will help out as much as I can.  If you make any changes
to the program, either for porting purposes or otherwise, let
me know and I will see about incorporating the changes into my
source.  This program requires 'getopt' which is not included
with this distribution.
