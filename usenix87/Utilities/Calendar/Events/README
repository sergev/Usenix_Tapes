Here are a few shell scripts and a C program for dealing with future
events.  `dates' is a program similar to `calendar' except that you can
ask it to report future events as well as today's.  I find it useful
for birthdays, seminars, and anything that needs reminding more than a
day in advance.  See `dates.1'.  I've been using the program for quite
a while now, and believe it to be stable (recently caught a leap-year bug).

`events' is a shell script that calls `dates' on a single, publicly
accessible file.  A flag lets you edit it while temporarily locking out
other attempts to do so.  I use it for keeping track of upcoming films,
but it clearly has other applications.

`remind' is a shell script that does more-or-less what `leave' does.
The difference is that it won't go away if you log out, and it will
contact you even if you change terminals.  It calls the enclosed shell
script `hi' to do this.

Note: fix paths in `events' and `remind'.

Enjoy.
