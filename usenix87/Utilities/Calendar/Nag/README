Description
-----------

Nag and okok are provide a reminder service for people who need
a *lot* of provocation before doing something.

The system lets you run arbitrary commands at intervals around
specified events.  For instance, you can echo a message 15, 10,
and 5 minutes before a meeting.  The configuration is kept in a
~/.nag file.  You add and alter events with your favorite
editor.

Okok (which is just a link to nag) provides a simple way of
shutting up messages once you've gotten the point.

You start a nag daemon in your .login or .profile.  It puts
itself in the background and exits after you log off.

The system works correctly if you are logged into multiple
terminals. Each login gets it's own daemon issuing messages on
each terminal. Running okok on one will silence output on all
the others.

Comparisons with existing facilities
------------------------------------

at:
	* Makes you post the events.
	* No intervals
	* Not available to all users.  Even on SV.2 with user cron tables,
	  you need special permission in cron.allow.
	* Doesn't know when you log out.

cron:
	* No intervals.
	* Not available to all users.  Even on SV.2 with user cron tables,
	  you need special permission in cron.allow.
	* Doesn't know when you log out.
	* Hard to turn off.

calendar:
	* One mail message only (too easy to ignore).
	* No subject line in the mail.

leave:
	* Inadequate flexibility.
