I took the postscript text posted, and added the following
cshell script text to the top of a file containing the postscript
stuff:

#!/bin/csh -f

END-OF-CALENDAR


----------
Note also that I have one extra line at the end of the postscript
text and I've substituted shell variables in the text for the month
and year.

This makes this program work like cal(1) except that you can pass
it a printer name if you like.

Now the only problem is I run this program to get 6/1960 and
I run cal(1) on the same month and I get two different answers!
