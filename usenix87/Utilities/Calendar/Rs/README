This directory contains the source and manual entry for the rs program.
See the manual entry for more information on the use of rs.

To Install:

1)	Look at rs.c and change any #defines needed.
	Defaults:

		CALENDAR  "/calendar"		users calendar file.
		RSFILE	  "/.reminders"		users reminder file.
		RSNOTES	  "/.rsnotes"		users notes    file.

		LPR		"/usr/ucb/lpr"	location of lpr command.
		EDITOR		"/usr/ucb/vi"	default editor.

		MAXLINES	500		Max. number of lines (reminders)
		MAXLEN		256		Max. len of a single line.

	If your /tmp directory is somewhere else, change rstmp.
	Default:	char rstmp[] = "/tmp/rsXXXXX"

2)	Edit the Makefile.

	Change target directory for the rs executable and manual entry
	if you wish.

	Defaults:

		DEST  = /usr/local		rs program >> /usr/local
		MDEST = /usr/man/manl		rs manual  >> /usr/man/manl

	If you have something other than termcap, make the change to LIBS.

	If you are not a BSD site, take '-DBSD' out of the Makefile so that
	strnchr and <string.h> will be used in place of rindex and <strings.h>

3)	Run 'make install' which will make and install the executables and the
	manual entries.
	If you want to compile the rs program in the current directory,
	run 'make program'.

The main purpose of the rs command, is to make remembering easy!
