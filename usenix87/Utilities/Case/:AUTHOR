I had to compare two versions of a file; one was mostly uppercase,
while the 2nd had a lot of changes that were only case changes.

While I wish "diff" had an ignore case option, it doesn't.  So
I spent 20 minutes and wrote this. (no cracks about my slowness).
It converts upper to lower or vice versa, and should work on just
about any system.

Note on names: "case" was out for obvious reasons.  "uc" implies
upper more than "lc" implies lower, to my limited mind.  And there's
already ld, ln, ls, and I used the alias "lf", so "u" looked better.

***FLAME SUIT ON***
If BSD 4.2 or V/2.0 already does this, MAIL but do not FOLLOW-UP.
***FLAME SUIT OFF**

As always, we welcome comments by spokespersons with opposing viewpoints.
