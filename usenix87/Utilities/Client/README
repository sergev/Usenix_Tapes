This posting includes source and man pages for two programs called
client and server.  They form a remote command execution facility
similar to rsh, except that the user of client(1) does not have to have
an account on the machine server is running on, and the commands
server(8) will allow to be executed are limited by a parameter file.
Some associated programs are also included.

An implementation of finger for use with client is included,
as are client and server shell scripts for a telephone directory
lookup facility.  Some people have noticed that uuhosts (not included
here) has a potential call on client in it.  Diffs to the man command
follow in a separate article.

This implementation is for 4.2BSD with inetd.  I may eventually
adapt it for 4.3BSD, which has better logging facilities than
server uses in this implementation.

WARNING:  It is easy to build new server facilities with these
programs, but it is even easier to write them in such a way as
to be very easy to break into and to use for unintended purposes.
I make no claims whatever as to the security, safety, or utility
of this software.  USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!
