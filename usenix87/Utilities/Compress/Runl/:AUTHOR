Subject: Quick compression (for ftp'ing tar files)

Having recently completed ftp'ing a couple of very large files over
the net, I thought it might be nice if this might be done a bit
faster.  The obvious solution is compression.  Indeed, I know of two
Unix compression utilities, compact and compress, which would serve.
Compress invariably compresses better and runs faster.

However, even compress takes a fair amount of time.  Given the format
of tar files (the most common file to ftp), I thought that a simple
run-length encoding scheme would run much faster while getting a fair
compression ratio.  A little run-length encoder I whipped up (see
below) runs about six times faster than compress on our Vax, but typ-
ically compresses by about 30% rather than the 40-50% often seen with
compress.

In any case, I offer it to you and hope it is of use.
