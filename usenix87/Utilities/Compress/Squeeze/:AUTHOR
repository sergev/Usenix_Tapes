I am sorry if the following has been posted before, but I received a number
of requests, so I am (re-?)posting it.  I acquired these programs from a local
BBS, where they were apparently modified to run on PCs. I have been using
them on our VAX for some time with no problem, although I am told by another
user that there is apparently a CP/M SQueeze utility out that is incompatible
with this usq. Test it before you rely on it!! (I don't know if it will run
on a PC.)
