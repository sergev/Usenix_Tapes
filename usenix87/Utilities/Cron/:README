[This is a "cron" for 4.3BSD (also 4.2) which implements the "user crontabs"
feature in System V cron.  Now all we need for it is to include "at" and a
way to define multiple "at" queues.  It also should have cron.allow and
cron.deny; emagine someone putting the line

* 5-60/5 * * * echo "THE ROOT IS A FINK!" > /dev/console

in their crontab.  The environment setting is also useful, and is NOT in
System V (cron/.proto is a poor substitute).  Also: the interaction of day-of-
month and day-of-week is incompatible with existing crons.  ++bsa]
