Vixie's Cron V1.0
May 6, 1987
Paul Vixie

This is a version of 'cron' that is known to run on BSD 4.[23] systems.
It is functionally based on the SysV cron, which means that each user
can have their own crontab file (all crontab files are stored in a
read-protected directory, usually /usr/spool/cron/crontabs).  No direct
support is provided for 'at'; you can continue to run 'atrun' from the
crontab as you have been doing.  No log file is written; also, the
cron.allow and cron.deny files were not implemented.  It doesn't run on
SysV, although some effort has gone into making that port an easy one.

The code was all written by me, and is (quoted from Makefile):

This is more or less the copyright that USENET contributed softwaree usually
has; the 'commercial...negotiable' is in case Berkeley or even ATT finds this
cron superior to their versions -- I certainly do.  Since ATT couldn't use
this version if they had to freely distribute source, and since I'd love to
see them use it, I'll offer some rediculously low license fee just to have
them take it.  In the unlikely event that they do this, I will continue to
support and distribute the pseudo-PD version, so please, don't flame me for
wanting my work to see a wider distribution.

To use this: Sorry, folks, there is no cutesy 'Configure' script.  You'll
have to go edit a couple of files... So, here's the checklist:

	Read all the INFO.* files
	Edit cron.h			/* both of these files have
	Edit Makefile			 * instructions inside */
	'make'
	'su' and 'make install'		/* you will be told to install the
					 * man pages by hand... */
	kill your existing cron process
	build new crontabs using /usr/lib/{crontab,crontab.local}
		(either put them all in "root"'s crontab, or divide it up
		 and rip out all the 'su' commands, collapse the lengthy
		 lists into ranges with steps -- basically, this step is
		 as much work as you want to make it)
	start up the new cron (must be done as root)
	watch it. test it with 'crontab -r' and watch the daemon track your
		changes.
	if you like it, change your /etc/{rc,rc.local} to use it instead of
		the old one.
