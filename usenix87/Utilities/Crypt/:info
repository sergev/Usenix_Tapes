	    CRYPTOGRAPHY SOFTWARE TO BE PUBLISHED HERE

During this week I will be posting two important pieces of encryption-
related software.  The first is a public-domain implementation of the
DES encryption standard, pulled down off a PC bulletin board and sent
to me by John Gilmore.  The second is the "crypt-breaker's workbench,"
by Bob Baldwin.  CBW is an interactive, full-screen program to decode
files that have been encrypted using the Unix crypt(1) command.  CBW
has been available to ARPAnet sites for some time.

There is a great deal of confusion about US laws regarding the export
of cryptographic technology.  This confusion caused the cancellation
of the DES article published in Volume 6, e.g.

John Gilmore spent some time reading US export regulations and law, and
provided me with the following information I quote below.  Basically,
all software is technical data; all data that has been generally
available to the public can be exported under a GTDA general license --
no paperwork or clearance is necessary.  Since both these items have
been generally available, I am free to export them via Usenet.  From a
reading of the regulations, it seems to me that if you first posted an
article with a "usa" distribution, you could then turn around and post
it with a "world" distribution without any concern.

For more information, interested parties should read the US Export
Administration Regulations, Part 370.2; Part 370.3; Part 379.1;
Part 379.2; Part 379.3; and Part 399.1, supplement #1, "ECCN 1527A"
which makes public software applicable for GTDA licenses.
