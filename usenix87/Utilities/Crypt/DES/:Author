Rich - Here is an updated copy of the DES routines shar file.  Phil found
and fixed a bug in the main.c module that caused the DES program to
occasionally mutilate keys resulting in un-decodable files.  He also has
now included uuencode and uudecode routines, which are helpful for creating
filters into and out of mail systems... since many mailers don't deal with
8-bit data.
