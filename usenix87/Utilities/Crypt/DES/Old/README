This program came from a cryptography related BBS near Washington, DC.
I have been unable to verify whether it works.  It does compile and run
on 4.2BSD (Sun Unix).  However, the other DES implementation I have
available (Sun's) uses a different format for keys.  I wish both would
allow you to type the 56-bit key as 14 digits of hex -- but neither one
does, they do different transformations of 8 bytes of ASCII.

If anyone has the DES validation samples [from the standard or its 
accompanying publications], please post them.

Note that I do not recommend the use of DES if you want to keep your
data secure.  All that can be said for it is that fewer people know
how to break it than crypt(1).
