This is a public domain version of AT&T's cut and paste commands. Included is
yet another version of getopt(3). If you already have a version then 
change the makefile.

The software has been tested on both 4.2BSD (CCI Power 6/32 aka Sperry 7000/40)
and SVR2 (3b2/400). It is currently in production mode on 4.2.

The only known difference is that this cut does not require the list to be in 
assending order.  e.g.
	cut -f4,2,1 x  <=>  cut -f1,2,4 x

When a range is specified then the range must be in order e.g.
	cut -f3-2
will cause an error message.
	
Depending upon your point of view this may or may not be a 
problem.

Error messages are a little more helpful than in SVR1, in particular they 
tell you what the limits are for line lenghts etc.

Feel free to change the software, send any bug reports to

since I am off the unix mail until the next assignment!!

Have fun,
