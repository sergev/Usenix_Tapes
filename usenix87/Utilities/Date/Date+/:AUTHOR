The recent date-oriented postings prompted me to finally get this out.  
What prompted its creation was the fact that I had to write yet another
single-purpose add-something-to-the-current-date program.  Also, I noticed a
recent posting of a script that used `at` with a "+ #" option that we do
not have.  

Now you can do things like:
	at `date+ 2 hours` < reminder
or	set lastmonth = `date+ -1 month "%y.%n"`

Date+ has more options than I know what to do with, but it's the kind of
program that needs options.  So send me your suggestions.  It is written
for Berkeley 4.2.

Here is a one line unshar that you can apply to most shar postings
to avoid having to edit off news/notes/mail headers.
 #! /bin/sh
 # unshar - pipe shar part of input through sh
 # Ignore lines before first "#" comment starting in first column.
 # Input is either $1 or stdin.
 sed -n '/^#/,$ p' ${1-} | sh
