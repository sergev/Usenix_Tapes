Here's a little Bourne shell script which allow you to
have "change bars" in your nroff/troff text to show what
has changed from the last version of your document.  In
case, there's not enough disclaimers in the script itself,
I did write this, but I didn't come up with the idea originally.
This also isn't necessairly the best way to do it (and if there
is a better way,  I'd be real interested in hearing about it).
We had a need for something quick and this ended up being it.
I don't make any claims as to how it works with other things
in between it and troff (like pic, I know that's a little wierd,
but it's still usable).  Because of n/troff's strangeness with
the ".mc" command, this doesn't come out with only the lines that
was changed having the "|" at the end.  When it's wrong, though,
there should be too many "|"s, not too few.  Enjoy.
