Display 1.0
15-December-1986

This is another C implementation of the 'display' command, written because
(a) is was easy, (b) I didn't know how to find the original, and (c) I have
an disease whose only means to remission is writing flinky programs like
this one.

Display runs a specified command over and over, printing the output through
curses(3X).  The command can be compound ('date;uusnap' is a personal
favorite), and the delay between executions is settable on the command line.
The output from the command had better fit on a single screen, of course.

To install, unshar into an empty directory, edit the Makefile to change the
DESTDIR (probably to /usr/local, /usr/local/bin or /usr/ucb), then su and
type 'make install'.
