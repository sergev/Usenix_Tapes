About a week ago I sent out a request for some software to draw
family trees.  I didn't find anyone who had anything, but there
did seem to be some interest in what I have.  This is a pretty young
program, and I submit it to the net in the hopes that there is
a large enough community of people interested in genealogy that we
can standardize on a data format and assist each other in creating
and improving the programs which work with that data.  Whether or
not this is the case, I plan on continuing to improve what I have.

	In response to a good many requests I have debugged the
	vsprintf routine in the original posting of Geneal. It
	is no longer used. The vsprintf routine proved to be to
	flaky across UNIX SYS V installations. Therefore the 
	new posting will work correctly on the following UNIX
	versions: Unix Version 7, BSD 4.1, BSD 4.2, and UNIX Sys V.

	Also in response from a good many people I have broken the 
	sources up into three parts. This will fix the problem with
	various mailers size limitations.
