	Changes made by Terry L. Ridder

	The tprintf function has been changed from calling vsprintf to
	calling sprintf. The reason for this is that the version of
	geneal for Unix Sys V was to flaky. I could not trust the 
	changes made to work the same way on different Unix Sys V
	installations.                              

	I have still included the file vsprintf.c in the distribution
	of geneal. I am rewriting vsprintf using the varargs.h and
	the example given in varargs(3). 

	The Makefile has been changed to reflect that vsprintf is no 
	longer needed by geneal. The Makefile has also been changed 
	in that there is now a define for USG. If USG is defined  the
	there are the necessary define's in place to take care of the
	switch of 'index' -> 'strchr' and 'rindex' -> 'strrchr'.
	

	The errorman.c file has been changed from calling vsprintf to
	call sprintf. The function errormsg is not used in the geneal
	program.

	The original file GENEAL.DOC was rewritten into a manual page
	, which is now called 'geneal.1'. The file geneal.man
	is the result of the cmd 'nroff -man geneal.1 > geneal.man'

	The original file PGMR.DOC was rewritten into a nroff file using
	ms macros. The file is now called pgmr.doc. The file pgmr.man
	is the result of the cmd 'nroff -ms pgmr.doc > pgmr.man'.
	
	All files are now in the style that I normally use in C programs.

	i.e. if (expression)	for (expression)	while (expression)
	     {			{			{
		....		    .....		    ....
	     }			}			}
 

	     if (expression)
	     {
		....
	     }
	     else		where '....' is any number of statements.
	     {
		....
	     }
