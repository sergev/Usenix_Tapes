This file describes what other files exist and what you will have to
do in order to make geneal useful to you.

Files of interest:
    *.[ch]	The source files for geneal.

    Makefile	Exactly that.

    README	What you are looking at right now.

    geneal.l	Manual page for geneal. nroff -man geneal.l to
	   	generate geneal.man.

    geneal.man	Manual page for geneal. Describes (briefly) what
		geneal is all about.  Gives list of options.

    pgmr.doc    nroff file for prog.man. nroff -ms pgmr.doc > pgmr.man

    pgmr.man	Programmer's documentation.  Gives more detail about some
		of the source files.  Read this if you are going to make
		any changes to the program or if you need to look for bugs.

    genealogy.dat    The data file.  This is a sample file for you to use
		as a template for creating your own data file.

    family.1003	Sample output file produced by "geneal -f 1003".

What to do (after unpacking):
1. Read geneal.man.
2. Make the program.  You should be able to simply issue a "make" command.
   If you wish, you can test it out at this point on the sample data file
   and make sure that it works.
3. Make your own data file.  Delete all of the supplied data file except
   record 0 (the description of the data format).  Add your own data in
   the same format.
4. Run the program.  There are numerous checks for data consistency, so
   you should get error messages if things do not point to each other
   properly.  These are typically easy to fix.
5. If you want to make changes, read pgmr.man first.
6. Send us your comments and improvements.
