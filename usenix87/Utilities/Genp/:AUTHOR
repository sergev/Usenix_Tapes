I'm sure there are better ways and better algorithms, but I just had to install
1,000 accounts for our students. I wanted passwords which are gibberish yet
rememberable. The following program generates passwords with alternating
consonant and vowel sequences, using "consonant" and "vowel" as defined in the
tables.

Sample output:
$ genp 3
viflaver
douparster
flaxchewjay

Obviously, if you're really concerned about security you can expand the
consonant and vowel lists to your heart's content.  For security, you should
also change the calls to rand() along the way to depend on current time, since
otherwise there's a finite list (30000) of sets of passwords which can be
generated. Or keep the source hidden.

Oh yeah: if anyone wants the code to create and install the accounts, generate
the passwords and simultaneously print an account/password form for each
student, I can provide it.  But it's a qed script.
