This quick throw-off is a public-domain implementation of the USG
getopt program.  Not to be confused with the library routine, this
program helps scripts parse their options/flags/arguments.

After unpacking, tweak the Makefile as appropriate and run make.  Copy
the examples from the manpage into separate files as verify that they
work ok.  Do a "make install".  For your final examination, convert
lint to use this program.  I write more Makefiles for mod.sources
submissions than I care to, and sometimes I get tired of it; I
apologize for the terseness of the one here.

If you don't have getopt(3) in your C run-time library, snip it off the
tail of the source file, and add it, or make it easily, publicly,
available in some other way.
