[ moderators note:   This program ONLY works properly on System III/V
  where chown(3) allows you to give away ownership of a file.  It might
  be useful to superusers on V7/BSD type systems, perhaps?

	Enclosed find the manual page and C source for a program
	to change owner and group id's for one or more files. If
	a named file is a directory, the entire tree beginning
	with (and including) that directory is descended and changed.
