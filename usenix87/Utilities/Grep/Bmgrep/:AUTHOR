1. Bug fixes:
	- incorrect operation of -x with -c, -s, -l. Fixed.
	- major bug, which was acute with piped input: lines containing
	matches were mangled or missed entirely. Fixed.
	- Some sites were having trouble with externs and #include files
	(the systems at Waterloo run 4.2, and we have not found this,
	but I have changed thing to make everyone happy.
	- Some compilers don't like line 36 of Search.c. I have
	added alternate code (line 39) against this possibility

	One site reported abnormally high system time. Installers may want to
	play around with MAXBUFF to optimize.

2. Added features:
	-e: take next argument as a pattern, even if it starts with a '-'
	-h: do not print file names.

3. Why bm is always case-sensitive.
	95% of the time I use a pattern matcher, I know the pattern exactly.
	If not, I use grep. I didn't consider the speed penalty worth it.
