This program 'greps' out a set of contiguous lines from a file based on a
pattern lying within the lines, and directions indicating how much of the
context surrounding the pattern is desired.  Context can be specified by a line
count, paragraph boundaries, or a second pattern to search for.  The same rules
may be used to print backward and forward from the initial pattern.  This is my
first posting of source code and any constructive criticism (but not flames) is
more than welcome.  Please report to me any further bugs that you may find.
