[  This is the latest posting of the Woods/Spencer super-fast grep.
   It was announced in net.sources a few weeks ago.  You will probably
   want to replace all your other greps with this one.  (Greps?)
   When you unpak this, take careful not of the last few lines of the
   script -- they make some "8-bit kanji" files.  --r$  ]
