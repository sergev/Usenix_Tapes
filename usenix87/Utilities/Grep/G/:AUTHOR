Hi,
	Well I hacked "tele" a bit further (sorry, I should have waited).
Below is a Bourne shell archive of "tele" and a manual page for it. The
GREP-like interface "g" now supports most of the grep options and besides
context provides another feature that I've always wanted in grep, multiple
patterns. For example, ever grep through the kernel looking for several
different defines or identifiers ?

	g -c3 -e nami -e iput iget sys/*.c

will print plus and minus three lines around every hit of nami, iput or iget.
