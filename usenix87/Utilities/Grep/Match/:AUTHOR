This contains the same bug fixes as in the latest release of
bm. Match is a very fast (faster than bm, much faster than grep)
pattern matcher for Vax machines, using the MATCHC
instruction. Be warned, though: some Vaxen (such as Microvax I)
interpret the MATCHC instruction, and don't achieve the same performance.
