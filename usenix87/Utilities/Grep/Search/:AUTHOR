Here is a little C program to search for an arbitrary string in a file
or files.  Unlike the 'grep' variety of searching commands, it works even
if the string to be searched for contains newline characters or if the
file to be searched is not an ASCII text file.  It reports the byte offset
(byte 1 is the beginning byte) at which the match occurred, and the line
of the file (number of newline characters encountered through the end
of the match, plus one) in which the match occurs.

Code follows below.  Do NOT run through /bin/sh or unshar.  Watch out
for trailing signature.  Flames about gotos > /dev/f77 :-).
