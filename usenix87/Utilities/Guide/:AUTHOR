This tidbit is being posted for oster%ucblapis.CC@Berkeley.  Kudos and
complaints to him, I'm just a middle-man.

On the macintosh, there is an "info" field on each file, in which you
can put a short description of the file.  I have implemented this on Unix:
The command "guide" types out the file ".guide" which contains a oneline
description of every file in the directory.
The command "makeguide" updates the .guide file, inserting the names of
any new files in the directory, and marking lines of formerly existing
files with a '#'.
