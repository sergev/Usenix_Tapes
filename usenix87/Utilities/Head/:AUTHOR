# I've recently had the  pleasure  (?)  of  working  with  an  AT&T
# 3B2/300.   Among  the  many  differences  I  encountered  are the
# absences of the Berkeley  commands  head(1)  and  ctags(1).   I'd
# gotten  used  to those command due to the generosity of Plexus in
# providing them on their System III and V  systems.   Needless  to
# say I immediately sat down and wrote them.
# 
# My version of head(1) adds a command line option to the standard:
# +n.   In  this  case,  +n means "skip n lines before displaying".
# Yes, I'm aware that I could use  sed(1)  for  this.   But  sed(1)
# doesn't stop when it has done what you asked.  It still processes
# to the end of file.  So, I figured that I'd  just  add  this  one
# little feature.
# 
# My version of ctags(1) is pretty much the same  as  the  Berkeley
# one,  as  far  as  I  can  tell.   It uses some code to recognize
# function declarations that I borrowed from `cpr'  (I  don't  have
# the  original author's name).  It is simple, straightforward, and
# readily modified.
# 
# As always, comments, changes, and corrections are welcome.
