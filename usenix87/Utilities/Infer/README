    infer --- an inference engine written in C, based on George
Hageman's programs "rulecomp", and "inference".

    Unfortunatly, not much is left of the original sources.  I began
by copying the expert.h file into infer.h, but now, the only things
left from the original are some names, and the keywords it recognizes.

    Now, down to building the thing.  First, edit the Makefile
and modify the BIN and CFLAGS variables to be compatible with your
system.  Type "make" and stand well back.  To crank it up type
"infer file" where file contains some rules.  The knowledge base
named "animal" is included, and is a copy of the original.  Infer
understands one option, "-v" for verbose.  It will display each
line it compiles to stdout, and display each rule it considers
as it contorts.  It's not espcially useful output, but, boy, is
it verbose!

    As it asks a question, infer understands [YyTt] for TRUE,
[NnFf] for FALSE, [Qq] for quit, and [Ww] for why.  The why only
shows rules proven TRUE, and the rule under consideration.

    If infer detects circular logic, it will attempt to display
each rule in the circle.  This should help isolate things pretty
well.

    Error messages are intended to be self-explanatory.  It mostly
complains about unopenable files, and improperly formed lines.

    If you find usefulness in this program, drop me a line.  I'd
be interested in knowing where it's used.
