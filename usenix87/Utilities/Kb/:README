I while back I posted the sources of a litle program that allows you
to jot down notes and then you can retrieve them again without knowing
were you put them on the system. (called KB).

This new posting has of course some bugs removed (and added, but I cannot 
find them), and now works without the need for other programs as
the orignal version did.

It also contains a very fast search algorithm that might be enough reason
to look at this code. 

Furthermore it contains a routine to actively go through all files in a
directory and possibly execute a function on them (something like
find . -print -exec \{\} .....) but then in C.

On top of that it contains a boolean expression parser which compiles to
intermediate code and does some optimalisations, this also might be of use
to someone not interested in the whole kb. stuff.

Feel free to use or abuse this sw, at your own risk.
