[ This posting contains a couple of features designed to have less and
  more "interoperate" more easily.  I have edited the prolog Casey
  sent with his submission.  In the next couple of paragraphs, read "I"
  as "Leith (Casey) Leedom," not "Rich $alz."  --r$]

I modified less to accept a command line parameter of the form "-number",
used to change the window scrolling size.  Some programs pass this on to
more, so I added it for compatibility.  This is reflected in the updated
manual page.

Not all programs that use a pager (e.g., man in the August seismo BSD2.9
distribution) refer to the $PAGER environment variable.  I therefore
wrote a small program designed to supplant /usr/ucb/more, or whatever
the local pager is.  It looks for $PAGER, and executes the indicated
program with the passed parameters, othherwise, it executes the default
pager (moved to somewhere else, like /usr/ucb/More) with the passed
parameters.

Also included are new versions of the makefiles, modified for pager_patch.
  I've also included new versions of all the makefiles (only slightly
modified).  The makefiles for Xenix and SYSV should be fixed to indicate
where Xenix and SYSV keep their standard pagers (I have no idea myself) - as
of now, they're both set to /usr/ucb/more.  "Make pager_patch" will make
the pager patch; "make install_pager_patch" will move the OLD_PAGER to
OLD_PAGER_NEW_LOCATION and install the pager patch in OLD_PAGER.
