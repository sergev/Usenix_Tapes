          _L_e_s_s is a program similar to _m_o_r_e (1), but which allows
          backwards movement in the file as well as forward movement.
          Also, _l_e_s_s does not have to read the entire input file
          before starting, so with large input files it starts up
          faster than text editors like _v_i (1).  _L_e_s_s uses termcap, so
          it can run on a variety of terminals.  There is even limited
          support for hardcopy terminals.  (On a hardcopy terminal,
          lines which should be printed at the top of the screen are
          prefixed with an up-arrow.)

          Commands are based on both _m_o_r_e and _v_i. Commands may be
          preceeded by a decimal number, called N in the descriptions
          below.  The number is used by some commands, as indicated.

          In the following descriptions, ^X means control-X.

          h    Help: display a summary of these commands.  If you
               forget all the other commands, remember this one.

          SPACE
               Scroll forward N lines, default one window (see option
               -z below).  If N is more than the screen size, only the
               final screenful is displayed.

          f or ^F
               Same as SPACE.

          b or ^B
               Scroll backward N lines, default one window (see option
               -z below).  If N is more than the screen size, only the
               final screenful is displayed.

          RETURN
               Scroll forward N lines, default 1.  The entire N lines
               are displayed, even if N is more than the screen size.

          e or ^E
               Same as RETURN.

          j or ^J
               Also the same as RETURN.

          y or ^Y
               Scroll backward N lines, default 1.  The entire N lines
               are displayed, even if N is more than the screen size.

          k or ^K
               Same as y.

          d or ^D
               Scroll forward N lines, default 10.  If N is specified,
               it becomes the new default for subsequent d and u
               commands.

          u or ^U
               Scroll backward N lines, default 10.  If N is
               specified, it becomes the new default for subsequent d
               and u commands.

          r or ^R or ^L
               Repaint the screen.

          R    Repaint the screen, discarding any buffered input.
               Useful if the file is changing while it is being
               viewed.

          g    Go to line N in the file, default 1 (beginning of
               file).  (Warning: this may be slow if N is large.)

          G    Go to line N in the file, default the end of the file.
               (Warning: this may be slow if standard input, rather
               than a file, is being read.)

          p    Go to a position N percent into the file.  N should be
               between 0 and 100.  (This is possible if standard input
               is being read, but only if _l_e_s_s has already read to the
               end of the file.  It is always fast, but not always
               useful.)

          %    Same as p.

          m    Followed by any lowercase letter, marks the current
               position with that letter.

          '    (Single quote.) Followed by any lowercase letter,
               returns to the position which was previously marked
               with that letter.  Followed by another single quote,
               returns to the postion at which the last "large"
               movement command was executed.  All marks are lost when
               a new file is examined.

          /pattern
               Search forward in the file for the N-th line containing
               the pattern.  N defaults to 1.  The pattern is a

               regular expression, as recognized by _e_d. The search
               starts at the second line displayed (but see the -t
               option, which changes this).

          ?pattern
               Search backward in the file for the N-th line
               containing the pattern.  The search starts at the line
               immediately before the top line displayed.

          n    Repeat previous search, for N-th line containing the
               last pattern.

          E    Examine a new file.  If the filename is missing, the
               "current" file (see the N and P commands below) from
               the list of files in the command line is re-examined.

          N    Examine the next file (from the list of files given in
               the command line).  If a number N is specified (not to
               be confused with the command N), the N-th next file is
               examined.

          P    Examine the previous file.  If a number N is specified,
               the N-th previous file is examined.

          = or ^G
               Prints some information about the file being viewed,
               including its name and the byte offset of the bottom
               line being displayed.  If possible, it also prints the
               length of the file and the percent of the file above
               the last displayed line.

          -    Followed by one of the command line option letters (see
               below), this will toggle the setting of that option and
               print a message describing the new setting.

          +cmd Causes the specified cmd to be executed each time a new
               file is examined.  For example, +G causes _l_e_s_s to
               initially display each file starting at the end rather
               than the beginning.

          V    Prints the version number of _l_e_s_s being run.

          q    Exits _l_e_s_s.

          The following two commands may or may not be valid,
          depending on your particular installation.

          v    Invokes an editor to edit the current file being
               viewed.  The editor is taken from the environment
               variable EDITOR, or defaults to "vi".

          Command line options are described below.  Most options may
          be changed while _l_e_s_s is running, via the "-" command.

          Options are also taken from the environment variable "LESS".
          For example, if you like more-style prompting, to avoid
          typing "less -m ..." each time _l_e_s_s is invoked, you might
          tell _c_s_h:

          setenv LESS m

          or if you use _s_h:

          LESS=m; export LESS

          The environment variable is parsed before the command line,
          so command line options override the LESS environment
          variable.  A dollar sign ($) may be used to signal the end
          of an option string.  This is important only for options
          like -P which take a following string.

          -s   The -s option causes consecutive blank lines to be
               squeezed into a single blank line.  This is useful when
               viewing _n_r_o_f_f output.

          -t   Normally, forward searches start just after the top
               displayed line (that is, at the second displayed line).
               Thus forward searches include the currently displayed
               screen.  The -t option causes forward searches to start
               just after the bottom line displayed, thus skipping the
               currently displayed screen.

          -m   Normally, _l_e_s_s prompts with a colon.  The -m option
               causes _l_e_s_s to prompt verbosely (like _m_o_r_e), with the
               percent into the file.

          -M   The -M option causes _l_e_s_s to prompt even more verbosely
               than _m_o_r_e.

          -P   The -P option provides a way to tailor the three prompt
               styles to your own preference.  You would normally put
               this option in your LESS environment variable, rather
               than type it in with each less command.  Such an option
               must either be the last option in the LESS variable, or
               be terminated by a dollar sign.  -P followed by a
               string changes the default (short) prompt to that
               string.  -Pm changes the medium (-m) prompt to the
               string, and -PM changes the long (-M) prompt.  The
               string consists of a sequence of letters which are
               replaced with certain predefined strings, as follows:

                    F    file name
                    f    file name, only once
                    O    file n of n
                    o    file n of n, only once
                    b    byte offset
                    p    percent into file
                    P    percent if known, else byte offset
               Angle brackets, < and >, may be used to surround a
               literal string to be included in the prompt.  The
               defaults are "fo" for the short prompt, "foP" for the
               medium prompt, and "Fobp" for the long prompt.
               Example: Setting your LESS variable to "PmFOP$PMFObp"
               would change the medium and long prompts to always
               include the file name and "file n of n" message.
               Another example: Setting your LESS variable to
               "mPm<--Less-->FoPe" would change the medium prompt to
               the string "--Less--" followed by the file name and
               percent into the file.  It also selects the medium
               prompt as the default prompt (because of the first
               "m").

          -q   Normally, if an attempt is made to scroll past the end
               of the file or before the beginning of the file, the
               terminal bell is rung to indicate this fact.  The -q
               option tells _l_e_s_s not to ring the bell at such times.
               If the terminal has a "visual bell", it is used
               instead.

          -Q   Even if -q is given, _l_e_s_s will ring the bell on certain
               other errors, such as typing an invalid character.  The
               -Q option tells _l_e_s_s to be quiet all the time; that is,
               never ring the terminal bell.  If the terminal has a
               "visual bell", it is used instead.

          -e   Normally the only way to exit less is via the "q"
               command.  The -e option tells less to automatically
               exit the second time it reaches end-of-file.

          -u   If the -u option is given, backspaces are treated as
               printable characters; that is, they are sent to the
               terminal when they appear in the input.

          -U   If the -U option is given, backspaces are printed as
               the two character sequence "^H".

               If neither -u nor -U is given, backspaces which appear
               adjacent to an underscore character are treated
               specially: the underlined text is displayed using the
               terminal's hardware underlining capability.  Also,
               backspaces which appear between two identical
               characters are treated specially: the overstruck text
               is printed using the terminal's hardware boldface

               capability.  Other backspaces are deleted, along with
               the preceeding character.

          -w   Normally, _l_e_s_s uses a tilde character to represent
               lines past the end of the file.  The -w option causes
               blank lines to be used instead.

          -d   Normally, _l_e_s_s will complain if the terminal is dumb;
               that is, lacks some important capability, such as the
               ability to clear the screen or scroll backwards.  The
               -d option suppresses this complaint (but does not
               otherwise change the behavior of the program on a dumb
               terminal).

          -p   Normally, _l_e_s_s will repaint the screen by scrolling
               from the bottom of the screen.  If the -p option is
               set, when _l_e_s_s needs to change the entire display, it
               will clear the screen and paint from the top line down.

          -h   Normally, _l_e_s_s will scroll backwards when backwards
               movement is necessary.  The -h option specifies a
               maximum number of lines to scroll backwards.  If it is
               necessary to move backwards more than this many lines,
               the screen is repainted in a forward direction.  (If
               the terminal does not have the ability to scroll
               backwards, -h0 is implied.)

          -[z] When given a backwards or forwards window command, _l_e_s_s
               will by default scroll backwards or forwards one
               screenful of lines. The -z_n option changes the default
               scrolling window size to _n lines.  If _n is greater than
               the screen size, the scrolling window size will be set
               to one screenful. Note that the "z" is optional for
               compatibility with _m_o_r_e.

          -x   The -x_n option sets tab stops every _n positions.  The
               default for _n is 8.

          -l   The -l option, followed immediately by a filename, will
               cause _l_e_s_s to copy its input to the named file as it is
               being viewed.  This applies only when the input file is
               a pipe, not an ordinary file.

          -b   The -b_n option tells _l_e_s_s to use a non-standard buffer
               size.  There are two standard (default) buffer sizes,
               one is used when a file is being read and the other
               when a pipe (standard input) is being read.  The
               current defaults are 5 buffers for files and 12 for
               pipes.  (Buffers are 1024 bytes.) The number _n
               specifies a different number of buffers to use.  The -b
               may be followed by "f", in which case only the file
               default is changed, or by "p" in which case only the

               pipe default is changed.  Otherwise, both are changed.

          -c   Normally, when data is read by _l_e_s_s, it is scanned to
               ensure that bit 7 (the high order bit) is turned off in
               each byte read, and to ensure that there are no null
               (zero) bytes in the data (null bytes are turned into
               "@" characters).  If the data is known to be "clean",
               the -c option will tell _l_e_s_s to skip this checking,
               causing an imperceptible speed improvement.  (However,
               if the data is not "clean", unpredicatable results may
               occur.)

          +    If a command line option begins with ++++, the remainder
               of that option is taken to be an initial command to
               _l_e_s_s. For example, +G tells _l_e_s_s to start at the end of
               the file rather than the beginning, and +/xyz tells it
               to start at the first occurence of "xyz" in the file.
               As a special case, +<number> acts like +<number>g; that
               is, it starts the display at the specified line number
               (however, see the caveat under the "g" command above).
               If the option starts with ++++++++, the initial command
               applies to every file being viewed, not just the first
               one.  The + command described previously may also be
               used to set (or change) an initial command for every
               file.

          When used on standard input (rather than a file), you can
          move backwards only a finite amount, corresponding to that
          portion of the file which is still buffered.  The -b option
          may be used to expand the buffer space.
