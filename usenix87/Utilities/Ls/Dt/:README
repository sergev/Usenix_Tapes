I spent an hour hacking this utility out because I was looking
for something like it but couldn't find one.  I guess you could
put together something in shell-script that does something similar,
but I don't like waiting that long for code to run. Also could
use find, I guess.....

This utility recursively descends a directory tree and prints
the structure of it.  I know that "ls -R" will do something
similar, but it doesn't leave out normal files.  This is a
heck of a lot more flexible in what it does, anyway.

The *real* reason that I wrote this was because I wanted to
learn more about the 4.3bsd file system (like symbolic links)
and also the directory reading calls.  I've been modifying
programs that use the directory reading calls, and I wanted
to write something original.

Took more time to figure out how to write a manual entry than
it did to code....
