Here's the results of my request for "dtree".  I recieved about 8 copies of
various versions, plus offers for about a dozen more.  Thanks for the active
response! Shortly after the sources, requests for the best one started drifting
in.  When the list of requests got over a dozen, I decided there might be
enough general interest in a reposting.  (I'm not sure what the level should be
to swing the post/e-mail scale.) Anyway, if you are happy with your copy of
dtree, hit "n" now.  Otherwise, I have run diff on the copies I got and sorted
out the one that seems to be the most complete.  It is reputed to run on System
V and 4.2 depending on #ifdef options, however I haven't tested it yet.  Enjoy!
