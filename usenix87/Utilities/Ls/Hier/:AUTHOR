hier(1) is yet another way to view a directory hierarchy.  It's
analogous to ls -R, but presents the data in a new fashion especially
useful for novice users or display on a wall.  Now, with the plethora of
similar tools available, what's special about this one?

- I wrote it after four *years* of consideration and using similar tools.
- I interacted with an "end user" who knew what he wanted.
- The code is carefully crafted, commented, and tested.  (But not yet
  widely ported, I fear.)

So give it a try, and see if you like it.

Also note!  This package includes a "sorted ftw()", which is a major
and non-trivial library routine you'll love if you are familiar with
ftw(3) (file tree walk), but wish you could get sorted results.

[  I ported SFTW to BSD.  This included writing (most of?) <ftw.h>
   and a couple of real minor tweaks.  I started on HIER, but gave up
   at the first bug.  A public-domain manpage for sftw would be real
   nice.  -r$ ]
