	This is 'lc', the program that everybody here uses instead of ls.
It may not seem like a big deal, but whenever somebody moves away, they
realise that lc isn't part of standard Unix, and call back to get a copy.

This is known to work on 4.2, 4.3, and Ultrix 1.2.  We don't have any
SysV machines here, so it may not work there.
