Summary: A C program to protect your terminal

Here's a very simple C program which will protect your terminal
session from unauthorized use.  It uses crypt(3) in conjunction
with /etc/passwd -- and requires you to type in the password
corresponding to the *login* user, located by getlogin(3).
I hereby place this in the public domain -- but I'd like a copy
of any improvements.
