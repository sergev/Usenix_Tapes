I noticed the net news regarding the construction of dependency
lists, so I thought the following program would be of interest.
Makemake is a (complicated) shell file which will take a list of
files, and construct a Makefile to compile the files into a binary
or a library.  Unfortunately it only handles single targets, but
the source may lie in many directories.

The feature of interest in the program is 'make depend', which constructs
the dependency list.  What might be a tricky activity is simplified
by using the C preprocessor itself; IT handles all that mucking
about with nested includes in multiple directories.  You also
get include dependencies right back to /usr/include, which I
suppose is good.
