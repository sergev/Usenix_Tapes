Enclosed is a program  named "newmake"  that  creates  a  generic
SCCS-style Makefile for its argument:

  Usage:	newmake filename
  Output:	Makefile for the file filename.c

I looked at several automated Makefile  generating  programs, but
found  them  to be overkill.  This is "quick and dirty", but fits
my needs.

This program was written for three purposes:  first,  to  quickly
automate  the  compilation  and  archiving  of  single  source  C
programs; secondly, to provide a base skeleton for creating  more
complex  makefiles;  and  thirdly,  for fun :-). 

Notes; first, the "make shar" output assumes  the  shar  you  use
supports  the  "-v"  option,  since I use Gary Perlman's version;
secondly, if you want to include the current date (in the form of
Saturday, December 7, 1985) compile with -DDAYTIME.  My apologies
to the author of the origional dtime.c routines, I've  lost  your
name;  thirdly,  you'll  certainly  want to modify the output for
*your* site; and lastly, I solved the BSD/USG  "time.h"  location
differences  on  my  machine by cross-linking the files.  You may
have to explicitly #ifdef them.

Things to do: Command-line arguments to drive the Makefile or ?
