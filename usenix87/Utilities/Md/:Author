Here 'tis.  It basically uses expr to hack apart the requested path, and do
mkdir's on all the intermediate components.  I wrote it a while ago, but
haven't used it much, but I do think it works well.  There are three known
problems:

     1.	It's slow.
     2.	It doesn't trap any signals, so you can hit delete and have half of a
	path made.  This doesn't hurt anything, you may just have to do a
	little cleaning up.
     3.	It's slow.

I called it md, for Make Directory, kind of like Change Directory.
