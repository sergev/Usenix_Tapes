Mult reads the input comparing adjacent lines.  In the normal case,
the second and succeeding copies of repeated lines are output,
and the remainder of the lines are removed.  Note that repeated lines
must be adjacent in order to be found, see sort(1).
This program was motivated by the uniq(1) program.
Options are present to output the first of multiple lines, for
comparing adjacent lines by field only, and for specifying the
field separator character.

Files are:
	mult.help - help file for mult(1)
	*.c = source
	mult.t.* = test files to test mult against, may be deleted

	After you read this in, type 'make mult', play with
	mult on some of the test files, and then read
	the help page last, :-).


	Enjoy,
	dennis
