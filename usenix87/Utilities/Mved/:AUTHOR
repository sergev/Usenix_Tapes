This is a quickie shell script that I think is rather fun.  It allows you
to change the names of a set of files by deleting or adding character patterns.

The '=' character acts as a wildcard much like the '*' does in many
PIP variants, ie: it can be used in the target file name and will
expand to whatever it matched in the source file name. '=' was chosen
as it is not expanded by the shell;  '\*' should also work, but doesn't.

For instance, to remove .old extensions from a set of C source files,
you could use:
	mved =.c.old old/=.c
To add a 'lib' prefix to all archives in the current directory use:
	mved =.a lib=.a

You can use he '-n' option to see what mved would do if you're unsure.
Use it if you're at all unsure of the results, especially for the first
few runs.  The script has only been used on a Sys V system.
It's yours to use, at your own risk.
