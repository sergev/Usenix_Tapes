Here is a simple routine you can use wherever you want to beep the terminal
without annoying people like Jordan (who has a terminal that chokes on ^G!)
It checks for a visual bell capability in $TERMCAP and uses visual bells
instead of control G if the terminal is capable, without dragging in the
whole term{cap,lib} library.  Note that is doesn't use stdio, you may want 
to change this for your particular application.
