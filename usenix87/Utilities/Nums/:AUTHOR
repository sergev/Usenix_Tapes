Greetings.  Here's an almost-ultimate (?) implementation of a list-of-numbers
generator.  It's carefully coded, proof-read, tested, and documented.  Of
course I've only run it on local systems (HP9000s), so I can't guarantee
ultimate portability.

 [
   It uses the new system V random number generator functions - srand48 and
   lrand48.  You should be able to replace srand48() with srand, and lrand48
   with rand() to make this run on most other systems.
