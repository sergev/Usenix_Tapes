Here is a csh script to find outdated symbolic links.  To my knowledge,
symbolic links are only available on 4.2BSD and 4.3BSD, so this script
is useless to people on other systems.

It is useful to run this script after moving files or directories around,
because you may have symbolic links to these files/directories that become
outdated after the move.

Usage: oldlinks <directory> [<directory>, ...]
Output: names of symbolic links (stored in the specified directory 
	hierarchies) which are outdated, if any.
