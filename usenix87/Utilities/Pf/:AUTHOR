pf is a C program to print files in multiple columns without truncating its
input on long lines.  To do this, it prints stuff using as many columns as will
fit on each page -- this means that pages of the same file are printed in
varying numbers of columns, which saves paper & usually reduces printing time.

Fight Back For Trees!!!

A manual page & a rudimentary makefile are included.  Mail bug fixes to me at
ukc!ubu!snow!req please; I will repost -- if there are any! :-) :-) :-)
The software has been in use for over a year now, with no major known bugs
remaining.  A rewrite would, however, possibly improve efficiency no end.

The original author was Crispin Goswell, who is possibly rlvd!caag, but I'm not
sure about that.  I have fixed a couple of minor bugs, but left the original
style/layout.

Enjoy!
