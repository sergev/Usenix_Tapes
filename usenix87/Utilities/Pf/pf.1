NAME
     pf - print file with automatic multi-columning

SYNOPSIS
     pf [ option ] ...  [ file ] ...

DESCRIPTION
     _P_f produces a printed listing of one or more _f_i_l_e_s. If there
     are no file arguments, or if a file name is '-' _p_f prints
     its standard input.

     Options apply to all following files:

     -_F   Specify footer information - see note which follows
          options.

     -_H   Specify header information - see note which follows
          options.

     -_d   Don't break a page for each file - continue in next
          column.

     -_e   Ensure all the columns on a page are of equal width.

     -_f   Produce true action for formfeeds, i.e. move to next
          page. The default action is to move to the top of the
          next column.

     -_h   Produces a list of options.

     -_j   Causes the text to be justified to the right hand
          column (old behavior).

     -_ln  Set the length of the page to 'n' (the default is 66
          lines).

     -_mn  Set the maximum number of columns to use to 'n'
          (default is the page width).

     -_sn  Set the minimum width to separate columns by to 'n'
          (the default is 1).

     -_tn  Set the width to which tabs are expanded to 'n' (the
          default is 8).

     -_wn  Set the width of the page to 'n' (the default is 132
          positions).

     The header and footer options H and F, respectively allow
     specification as follows:

     Mere inclusion indicates that headers and footers are
     required.

     Either can be followed immediately by one of l, c or r which
     mean that the next argument will be the _l_e_f_t, _c_e_n_t_r_e or
     _r_i_g_h_t header or footer respectively. The s specification,
     immediately followed by a number will give the vertical size
     of the header or footer,
     e.g.  Fs3 indicates that footers are to be placed in three
     lines at the bottom of the page.

     The three headers or footers are placed on a single line in
     the middle of the vertical space.

NOTE
     _P_f knows about control characters and escape sequences of
     length two: it assumes these to print in zero width and will
     print them even if the line has been truncated because it is
     longer than a page.  These means that bold will get turned
     off properly when the line is too long.  To prevent this
     behavior, put the input through _c_o_l_r_m first.
