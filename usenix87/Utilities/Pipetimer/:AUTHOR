Don't be concerned about the warning msgs produced by line 34 of
listener.c.  For some block sizes ("chunks"), an odd sized block
is transmitted to insure that a full 1M byte of data is transmitted
in the cases where 1M is not an integral multiple of the block size.

The timing statistics are written to *stdout*.  *timesPrint* insures
that the talker and listener don't write to *stdout* at the same
time.  Error msgs appear on *stderr*.  Enjoy.
