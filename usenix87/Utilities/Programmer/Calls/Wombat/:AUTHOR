[ I collapsed the handling of the -D -I and -U flags, and changed the
  lines that used sprintf's return value.  Other than index/strchr, it
  should work on any Unix.  --R$]

This is a massively revised, bug-fixed, and hacked version of "calls",
which has been bouncing around the net for some time.  Comments and
bugs and whatnot to Kevin Braunsdorf at pucc-j!ksb or ksb@j.cc.purdue.edu.

It's also available via anonymous ftp on j.cc.purdue.edu.
