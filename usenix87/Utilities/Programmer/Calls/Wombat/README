Calls is a program I use a lot.  It came off the net last year;
since then I have been beefing it up to take on bigger and better
things (static functions are the biggest).  The only thing calls
would like to know to run okay is if calloc() really does zero out
all of the memory it returns: if not, use the -DBADCALLOC in the
Makefile.

P.S. to see the neat stuff you might try
	./calls -v -F newHASH/scan.c -f level1 -f dostdin *.c
