# In 1983, the calls program was given to the net by
# M. Taylor from DCIEM. Subsequent hacking by various 
# people produced a version posted in 1984. About that 
# time, I started using it heavily, found some things
# lacking in it, and began fixing/reworking a number
# of bugs/features. The current version has been in use
# for over a year now with no further changes, so it is time
# to give it back out to the net for further use and abuse.

# Note that this version assumes that "cc -E" is available
# to access the C preprocessor. It also assumes that getopt(3)
# is available, which most people should have by now. (If not,
# write.)
