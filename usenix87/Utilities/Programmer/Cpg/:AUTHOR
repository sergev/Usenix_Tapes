	Here is a 'working' version of the same program that was posted by
	someone else a while back (whoever you are, take credit). It will
	compile on VAX/VMS4.1 with the C2.0 compiler, and I expect that it will
	compile on any other UNIX system since as far as I can remember there
	is *no* fancy code in it. It just makes it easier to read a C source
	listing since it finds the function definitions and breaks the pages
	there. The table of contents should be sorted, but I had to comment
	that out for my computer (VMS) which doesn't have the same sort as UNIX
	and I didn't care to go to the trouble. The program should be pretty
	self-explanatory. The following is the C code for cpg. Get out your
	scissors and leave /bin/sh at home, because this is *not* an archive.
