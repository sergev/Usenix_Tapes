Here is a distribution kit for my macro based debugging package.  I have
found it invaluable in porting stuff around to many different systems,
which may or may not have a conventional debugger.

One very useful feature is that a complete execution trace can be
dumped into a normal file, for comparison with a reference run on
a system where the suspect program works correctly, thus isolating
the place where the two executions diverge.  I.E.:

	On reference system:

		myprog -#d:t:F:L:o,goodlogfile <some arguments>

	On other system:

		myprog -#d:t:F:L:o,badlogfile <some arguments>

	Copy other badlogfile to reference system and:

		diff goodlogfile badlogfile


SPECIAL AMIGA NOTES:

On the AMIGA or other non-protected machines note the 'D' control
flag, which provides for a delay after each debugger output line.
I set my delay to about half a second (:D,5:) to give the system
time to flush my line out before it crashes due to one of the code
lines executed after the dbug line.

For the AMIGA, the installation procedure is as follows, assuming you
have my "cc", Lattice C frontend:

	(1)	cc -c dbug.c
	(2)	copy dbug.o df1:lib/dbug.lib
	(3)	makedir df1:include/local
	(4)	copy dbug.h df1:include/local/dbug.h

Then, reference the library using "-ldbug" on the cc command line.

	cc -o foo foo.c -ldbug
