The following program is a first cut at producing a program generator that
will produce the boiler plate needed at the beginning of most programs.
Unpack the archive, make the program, and type, for example

	mkprog -o ab

and look at the program generated in prog.c.  EXAMPLE contains a commented
output.

I hope to work further on it and produce something worth archiving in
mod.sources.  I will appreciate comments and, above all, code to improve
this version.

Enjoy!
