Mkprog will make a skeleton of a program, which includes the
"boiler-plate" that almost all programs contain.  That includes certain
external declarations, the code for interpreting specified command line
options, and the code for for looping over named files, with standard
input as the default.  The generated program will interpret command
line arguments using getopt(3).  Many options exist.

I am posting this preliminary version to net.sources and hope to get ideas
for improvements as well as bug fixes.  I hope to incorporate as many
suggestions as possible, and to post a new version to mod.sources later.

I can be reached as ellozy@harvard, which is on most nets known to man or
beast.
