1.  It should be possible to specify whether you want your programs to
have RCS or SCCS stuff, and what your favorite tab indent is, in an
environmental variable.  Easy to do, but I have temporarily run out of
energy.

2.  While on the subject of environmental variables, the generated code should
be able to search for options first in an environmental variable, then on
the command line.

3.  It would be nice to be able to say, for example:

	mkprog -i l,page_len,66 ...

to mean that there should be a -l flag, setting the value of the int variable
page_len, with a default (if no -l flag) of 66.  Trickier (not really difficult)
and I am not sure how necessary.

Comments will be appreciated, code even more so.
