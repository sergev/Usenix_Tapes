[ One of the major reasons why I'm sending this out is that is
  that there is now a manual page.  From now on, I will probably
  not send out anything that is missing one.  Probably exceptions
  are non-Unix source, like the recent Apollo pacman.  --r$]

The enclosed shar file is an enhanced version of printfck which
generates check code for scanf() as well as printf(), has a
manual page and comes with a makefile.  It is a straightforward
extension of the program from Guido van Rossum (mod.sources:
Volume 4, Issue 114) which was recently distributed.
