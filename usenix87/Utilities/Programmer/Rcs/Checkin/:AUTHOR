This tool provides 
	-- an editor interface for creating RCS log messages.
	-- automatic RCS checkin using just-created logs.

If you are a user of RCS, and find yourself frequently using `rcsdiff` to
create a log messages, `checkin` may be useful.  Additionally, checkin retains
a log message, once created, if, for some reason the RCS checkin procedure `ci`
fails. 

The man page and csh script, in shar format, are included below.

`checkin` has been in use by several users on our Vaxen for a few months.  We
are running 4.2bsd.
