This is CVS, Concurrent Versions System, a front end for RCS.  It
supports the concurrent and independent use of an RCS directory by
several people.  We have been using it for half a year now, on various
projects.  It uses the RCS programs rcs, ci, co, rcsmerge and rlog in
such a way that you can do a multi-file commit, etc.  It is all shell
scripts.
