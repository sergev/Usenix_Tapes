CVS is an front end for RCS, supporting the concurrent and independent
use of an RCS directory by several people.  See manual page cvs.1.

This set of shell scripts assumes the presence of the RCS programs
rcs, ci, co, rcsmerge and rlog (by Walter Tichy).

To install, examine the Makefile and give suitable values to:

CVSBIN	the directory for the commands themselves	eg. /usr/local
CVSLIB	idem for the auxiliaries			eg. /usr/lib/local/cvs
CVSMAN	idem for the manual page cvs.1			eg. /usr/man/man1
RCSBIN	the directory that holds the RCS programs	eg. /usr/bin

Then call     make install

Be sure you can write/create:
	in $(CVSBIN): AE CM CV DF GC LS RM RV SV UV
	in $(CVSLIB): anything
	in $(CVSMAN): cvs.1

NOTE:
If you have been using CVS already, you may have directories named ".old";
they are now named "Attic".  Please rename any you have before starting to
use this release.
