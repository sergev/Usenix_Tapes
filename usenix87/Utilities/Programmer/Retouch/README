retouch is a command that can be used to "correct" last changed
dates, such as when by 'make' or 'ls -l -t'.  These dates
can be inaccurate after a cp, or uucp, or kermit to create a new
copy of an existing file, or to import it from another system.

retouch looks for an sccs string of the form
	@(#) anything at all mm/dd/yy
	@(#) anything at all yy/mm/dd
to get the date.  It is intended for use on source files, and
assumes there is no such string if it's not in the top 10 lines.

It has the following options:
	-v	verbose
	-g	assume the date is GMT rather than local time
	-d date	set the last change date to "date".

It has defs for BSD and USG, although it's been tested only
under BSD.  It was intended as a one-time hack, and may not
be as clean as it should be, but it has proven versatile and
necessary over the past 6 months.

I'd appreciate any suggestions or changes.
