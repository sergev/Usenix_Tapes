Mod.sources:  Volume 4, Issue 50
Submitted by: convex!smu!s100ms!marquez

I have put some hacks into the shortc program recently posted to mod.sources.
First, shortc can now take input from a pipe,  as in:

cat *.h *.c | shortc -p > global.h

of course the same effect is gained by "shortc *.h *.c > global.h", but
this allows for special applications.  I also added a -s option so that
a sed command file can be created instead of an include file.  Remember,
if the -s option is needed, then the -p option will probably be required
too.

This submission is in the form of a context diff, suitable for "patch"ing
the original.
