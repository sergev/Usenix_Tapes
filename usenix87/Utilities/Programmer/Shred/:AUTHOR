	This is a quick hack that may come in handy. It takes a .c file 
and tries to chop it up into discrete subroutines. (Note the "TRIES")
If you use it, I suggest using it in a subdirectory of its own, and
on one file at a time. It functions by getting subroutine names, prepending
and "_" and then appending what it thinks is the subroutine. Misc stuff
(that it can't recognize) goes into _header.h
	Hope it comes in handy...
