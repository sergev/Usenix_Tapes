An  a.out  to  s-record converter was recently requested, so here is the
source in shar format.  I've included a manual (man macros) and a simple
makefile.   I've  used  tohex to download to emulators, prom programmers
and  embedded  systems.   It runs on Unisoft System V.0 and an old 68000
Xenix system.  I owe the original idea to Bill Welch (zaiaz!bill).
