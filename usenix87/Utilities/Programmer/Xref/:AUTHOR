In the last few months a couple of requests for f77 or C cross
reference map generators have appeared on the net.  This submission
is a quick and dirty implementation of a general purpose (i.e. stupid)
cross reference utility.  It was done using lex, awk, and sh as an
example for a UNIX tutorial.  I have mailed copies to the original
requestors.  Possibly some of the rest of the net isn't satisfied by
egrep, ctags, ptx, etc., and might like it too.
