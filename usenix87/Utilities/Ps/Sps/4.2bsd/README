		SPS - Show Process Status
		=========================
To compile, install and test, type the following commands (as super-user):
	% make                  # Compile SPS
	% make install          # Install SPS into /bin/sps
	% sps i                 # Initialise SPS
	% sps va                # Run SPS
********************************************************************************
The files in this directory are for the 4.[12]BSD / VAX-11 version of SPS.
Compiler options are as follows -
	-DCHAOS         if the Chaos network is incorporated into 4.xbsd
	-DTRACE         for testing/debugging purposes
	-DBSD42         compile SPS for 4.2bsd.
			Otherwise, SPS is compiled for 4.1bsd.
********************************************************************************
If you want to tell SPS about a new type of device, then add a new line to
the symbol table (see globals2.c),after ensuring that there is sufficient
room in the `info' structure. (NWAITSTATE may need to be increased in sps.h).
********************************************************************************
SPS understands if the size of internal kernel tables are changed under VMUNIX,
but must be recompiled if major modifications are made to the kernel.
