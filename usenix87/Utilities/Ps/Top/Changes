Mon Oct  6 1986 - wnl (2.1)
	A bug with the kill command was pointed out by "dciem!tim"---
	specifying a signal by name did not work correctly.  This bug has
	been fixed with a simple change to commands.c.  Another bug made
	the cpu state percentages incorrect the first time they were
	displayed.  This bug has also been fixed (changed top.c).

Thu Sep  4 1986 - wnl (2.0, at last)
	This is the version that will (hopefully) get released to the
	world as top 2.0.
	Added the "r" and "k" commands for renice and kill, respectively.
	This required adding a way to handle system call errors, and the
	addition of the "e" command.  Help screen and manual page were
	changed to reflect this change.  Changed all "#ifdef SUN" directives
	to "#ifdef sun", and changed all "#ifdef PYRAMID" directives to
	"#ifdef pyr".  As much as I hate those choices of preprocessor
	names (they too easily conflict with real variable names), it does
	make automatic compilation possible---people don't have to change
	the Makefile anymore for specific machines.  The manual page was
	changed to automatically incorporate the defaults as set in the
	Makefile (including an infinite value for TOPN) and the way the
	manual page is generated by the Makefile was changed to make
	maintenance of this information automatic.

Mon Jul 28 1986 - wnl (still pre 2.0)
	Real close now.  I put in a new definition for the macro "pagetok"
	that does an explicit shift of a constant expression involving
	PGSHIFT.  Appropriate checks are made if PGSHIFT is to small.
	"pagetok" is now used exclusively everywhere to convert kernel
	clicks to kilobytes.  I added a full blown interactive mode with
	the ability to change some of the runtime parameters (how many to
	display, time delay, etc.) while top is running.  I also
	incorporated a few ideas from the net:  control characters in the
	command name are replaced with '?'; the '-S' option makes the
	swapper and pager visible; options have been added to control the
	number of displays produced (this makes it easier to make
	performance snapshots with top).  I have also added the notion of
	"infinite" values for number of processes and number of displays.
	I fixed a long-standing bug in the uid to username mapping code
	that was only aggravated on the pyramids:  it was an ill-defined
	expression (akin to i = i++).  I tweaked the proc_compar routine
	for qsort slightly so that stopped processes were more likely to
	show up.  Manual page was updated to reflect all changes
	noticeable to the user.

Tue Jul  1 1986 - wnl (pre 2.0 -- 1.9999?)
	In the process of major revamping on the way to version 2.0.
	I have completely done away with curses by adding my own screen
	management routines in a separate file (screen.c).  The rationale
	for this is that top knows a whole lot more about what is and is
	not redundant on the screen and can compare simple integer values
	where curses would have to compare strings.  This has turned out
	to be a very big win speed-wise.  The proc_compar routine for
	sorting has been rewritten to include several more keys.  I
	decided this was necessary when I noticed that the "top" process
	itself kept disappearing off the top 10 list on a Sun-3.  All the
	processes had the same percentage (0%) and the sort wasn't really
	doing anything worthwhile.  I changed the expression that computes
	memory usage to use the ctob macro instead of just assuming that
	pages were 512 bytes.  More work still needs to be done before
	this version is usable.  I changed options-processing to use
	getopt and added appropriate incantations to the Makefile.

Wed Feb 20 1985 - wnl (still 1.8)
	Put in the ifdef FOUR_ONE statements to make top still compilable
	on a 4.1 system.  Apparently, there are some users out there that
	need this functionality.  Oh well.  I don't guarantee any of it,
	since I can't test it.  Made appropriate changes to README and
	final installation related changes to Makefile.

Sat Feb  2 1985 - wnl (1.8)
	Removed all the ifdef FOUR_TWO statements and made "top" into a
	4.2 only program.  If someone really wants to still run it on 4.1,
	then they can do all the work.  We don't have a 4.1 machine
	anymore, so I don't even know if the thing still works under 4.1.
	Cleaned up the Makefile and the README.  Added installation rules
	to the Makefile, as requested by several sites.  Fixed a very
	obscure divide-by-zero bug.  Added a second "key" to the qsort
	comparison function (proc_compar) so that comparisons are based on
	cpu ticks if the percentages are equal (provided by Jonathon
	Feiber at Sun).

Tue Dec 11 1984 - wnl (1.7)
	Added the virtual and real memory status line to the header area
	(provided by Jonathon Feiber at Sun)

Tue Nov 20 1984 - wnl (1.6)
	Added an "exit" if sbrk's fail.  Added changes from Jonathon
	Feiber at Sun:  ifdef SUN to make top work on Suns (they don't use
	doubles in the proc structure), register declarations, check for
	getting a user structure that has disappeared since the proc array
	was read (it used to die, now it just shows the process as swapped).

Tue Nov 13 1984 - wnl (1.5)
	If the number of displayable processes ("active_procs") was less
	than the number of requested processes ("topn"), top would
	segmentation fault.  This bug has been fixed.  Thanks to Prentiss
	Riddle at ut-sally for pointing out the existence of this bug.

Tue Oct 23 1984 - wnl (1.4)
	Finally fixed the hash table bug that caused processes owned by
	root to sometimes appear with either no name or a different name
	that had UID 0 (such as "operator").  Removed all the ifdef DEBUG
	blocks to make top ready for distribution to the real world.

Sun Apr  8 1984 - wnl (still 1.3)
	Made some slight changes to the display format.  It now looks more
	aesthetically pleasing.  Added some preprocessor constants so that
	the two defaults (number of processes and seconds of delay) easier
	to change.

Thu Apr  5 1984 - wnl (1.3)
	Changed the order in which things are done at initialization time.
	This way, if an error occurs before starting the main loop, curses
	will never get started.  Also changed other error handlers so that
	endwin() is called before any flavor of exit.  Specifying a number
	of processes that is more than the screen can handle is no longer
	fatal.  It displays a warning message and pretends the user
	specified the maximum for the screen.  Finally cured all the TSTP
	blues (well, almost all).  I removed my TSTP handler and convinced
	the system to always use the one that curses sets up.  Turns out
	that "sleep" was stepping all over it during a pause.  So, I don't
	use sleep anymore.  The only problem that remains with it now is
	redrawing the old display before updating it after a pause.

Tue Apr  3 1984 - wnl (from 1.0 to 1.2)
	I changed the format of the TIME column from just "seconds" to
	"minutes:seconds".  I also made pausing work correctly.  Screen
	redraws with an up to date display.  For compatibility with 4.2, I
	changed the name of the "zero" function to "bzero".  The makefile
	has been altered to handle versions for 4.1 and 4.2, and README
	has been updated to reflect these recent changes.
