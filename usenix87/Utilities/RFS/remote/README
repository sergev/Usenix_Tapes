Start with running off the following documents in the doc directory:

	install.ms	(standard Berkeley ms macros)
	remotename.2	\
	remoteon.2	 \ (standard Berkeley man macros)
	rfs_server.8	 /
	rmtmnt.8	/

The directory doc/paper, contains a paper that contains most of the early
design considerations for RFS, but is written using some TEK-internal
ms macros.

Read the install.ms document first.
