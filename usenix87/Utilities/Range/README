Here is the command we use to
generate values for Shell loops.  The syntax was intended to
match that of the Shell.  Originally, it was called `from',
which might be a better name, but it later clashed with another command.
It isn't spectacular, but I thought it would be nice to see some
source in this news group for a change (hint), however short.

Exercise: extend it to allow looping through string values
