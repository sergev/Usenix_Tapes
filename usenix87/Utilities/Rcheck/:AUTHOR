This program tells you when users log in or out from your machine
and from other machines connected to a local network. It can be told
to only watch for some users, ttys and hosts in any combination you
like.
The program was written on a VAX 11/750 with 4.2 BSD and will only
work on a 4.2 BSD system in its original form. If you don't have
4.2 BSD you will have to change a little in the makefile, and then
it might work. If it does it will ignore a local network, if there's any.
