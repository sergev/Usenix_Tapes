Here is an interactive rmdir Bourne shell script which prompts
user for confirmation whenever he/she attempts to delete a non-empty
directory. I found this useful because I used to use the /bin/rm -r 
to delete such directories.  However, if I made a mistake with this command
it would delete all my files !!  This shell script is the safe way out.
Also, its convenient.   

Please test in a separate directory before use !! NO GAURENTEES
No Copyright but credit me out of courtesy if you don't mind !

To use shell this file ;
