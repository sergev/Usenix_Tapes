  I don't know if this is a generic UN*X problem, or if it just
occurs on our Masscomp system, but sometimes improperly written
programs will create files which rm can not remove.  (Typically
because they contain imbedded garbage characters.)

  This program, rm-damnit(1), allows users to remove these files.

  I have checked this program out pretty carefully, but since it
does delete files, be warned that it comes with *NO* guarantees.
(We use it at geowhiz and haven't had problems.)
