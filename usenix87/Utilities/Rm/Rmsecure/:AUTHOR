Below is the presentation and the code of a command which replace "rm";
it works exactly the same, except that it just asks for confirmation when
its arguments use some wild cards.

[ This ONLY works with csh, because it uses aliases, and it may only work
  with the BSD4.2 or better csh      - John P. Nelson, moderator mod.sources
]

I wrote it long ago, after having had some bad experiments with conjonction
of misstyping and wild cards in the use of the usual "rm" command.
These accidents turned sometimes to drama, especially when I was learning
the (difficult?:-) job of the superuser.
Months along, other users too experimented such personnal disasters and the
safe "rm" gained popularity on our site. We have now used it without problems
over a year.

I would be pleased if it could be of some interest for other (super)users.
