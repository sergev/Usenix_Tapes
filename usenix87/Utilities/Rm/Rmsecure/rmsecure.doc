Adding security when removing files:
------------------------------------

DESCRIPTION:
------------
With the standard "rm", no confirmation is asked when using wild cards;
you surely once experienced that this may be really catastrophic.
If not, think about a misstyping like "rm * BAK" instead of "rm *BAK" !!!

A new command, "rmsecure", may prevent this by asking for a confirmation
before removing any file whose name issued from a wild card expansion.

This command works a bit slower than the usual "rm", but is really safer !


USE:
---
To use it, you MUST create a special alias like this one:

	alias rm '(set noglob; rmsecure \!*)'

in order to prevent former wild cards expansion by the shell.

When used, any list of files resulting from a wild card expansion will be
asked globally for confirmation prior to deletion; if answer is negative,
each file in the expanded list will be prompted separatly, like the "-i"
option of usual "rm".

As reel deletion take place only just before completion of the command,
this one can be safely interrupted at any time if necessary; in this case,
no file will be removed.


WARNING:
--------
Files whose name is completely specified won't be asked for confirmation,
even if they appear between other arguments using wild cards.


LIMITS:
-------
 - as all expanded file names are concatened within one unique string,
   command can fail due to limitation of shell variable length.
   To overcome this, just select narrowed range.

 - due to successive evaluations, any quotes or double quotes will be lost;
   removing files with "strange" names should be done with the standard "rm"
   command using the "-i" option with a "*" wild card.

 - the following version is running perfectly with Cshell of 4.2 bsd;
   problems were encountered trying to run it on Unisoft System III,
   probably due to some limitation of the Cshell implemented.
