This is an online rolodex program that has been used here at Thinking
Machines Corporation for quite a while.  Lot's of people find it very
useful and I have never had any problems with it.

This code has only been tested on BSD42 on a VAX.  It definitely will
not work under System V, although I have included a "sys5.h" to start
things going.

Instructions on how to install:

1.  This program should have come in 3 parts.  Choose an empty directory,
    and unshar them all.  Check the Makefile, you may want to select
    either TERMCAP or TERMINFO.

2.  Pick a library subdirectory where the help and menu files will go.
    (Say /usr/local/lib/rolo).  Edit the Makefile and change the definition
    of ROLOLIB to that path.  (Do not leave it as is!).

3.  Create the directory and move all the files in helplib to this directory.

4.  Pick the appropriate place in your manual hierarchy where the man
    page should go.  Adjust MS and MAN in the Makefile accordingly.

5.  Pick the appropriate place where the executable should live.  Adjust
    BIN in the Makefile accordingly.

6.  Edit the manual page (ctools.1) if you wish to change the FILES
    section to point to the directories you selected.

7.  Type 'make man' and read the manual page.

8.  Type 'make'.  

9.  Type 'rolo' and try out the rolodex program!

10.  Type 'make install'.

11. Type 'make clean'.


The files ctools.c and ctools.h in the toolsdir directory are useful in
their own right, as they contain many little useful string manipulation
routines and other goodies.  You might wish to install it as <ctools.h>
and -lctools as is done here.
