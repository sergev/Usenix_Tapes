You are adding a new entry to your rolodex database.  If you want to
get back to the main menu type the character '\' followed by RETURN.

Each entry is composed of 7 fixed items, which are Name, Work Phone,
Home Phone, Company, Work Address, Home Address, and Remarks.  You are
being prompted to give a value to each item, one after the other.  Simply
type in some characters and end with a RETURN.  If you realize you've made
a mistake after hitting RETURN, type '^' RETURN, which will prompt you
again for the item you just entered.  If you have no information for a 
particular item, simply type RETURN and you will be prompted for the next
item.   Finally, the program will prompt you with 'Other fields? '.   At
this point type 'no' RETURN unless you know what you are doing (see below).

     (Advanced feature) If you have entered all the information about a person
you have, and the program is still prompting you for fields, type '!' RETURN
and it will assume that all the remaining fields are to be left empty.
     (Advanced feature) You can add items in addition to those listed above.
To do so answer 'yes' to the 'Other fields? ' prompt and then ask for help.
     (Advanced feature) The character ';' is used as a line separator.  If
you typed in '245 First St.,; Cambridge, MA 02139', when this information was
displayed the street address and city/state would print out on different lines.
