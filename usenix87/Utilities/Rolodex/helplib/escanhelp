The rolodex program is displaying each entry in your rolodex database
(the entries are ordered alphabetically) one by one.  After an entry
has been displayed, you have the option to

  -- have the next entry displayed (type RETURN)
  -- have the previous entry displayed by (type '<' RETURN)
  -- delete the entry from your rolodex (type '-' RETURN)
  -- change the information contained in this entry (type '+' RETURN)
  -- abort this sequential display mode and go back to the main menu 
     (type '\' RETURN)

If you elect to delete the entry, the message 'Entry deleted' will be
displayed briefly, and then the next entry will be displayed.

If you elect to update the entry, after you have completed the update
operation the message 'Displaying next entry in scan list' will be
displayed briefly, and then the next entry will be displayed.
