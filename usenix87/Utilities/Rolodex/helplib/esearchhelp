The rolodex program is displaying each entry that matches the search string
you provided, one by one.  After an entry has been displayed, you have
the option to

  -- have the next entry displayed (type RETURN)
  -- have the previous entry displayed by (type '<' RETURN)
  -- delete the entry from your rolodex (type '-' RETURN)
  -- change the information contained in this entry (type '+' RETURN)
  -- abort this sequential display mode and go back to the main menu 
     (type '\' RETURN)

     If you elect to delete the entry, the message 'Entry deleted' will
be displayed briefly, and then the next entry will be displayed.
     If you elect to update the entry, after you have completed the
update operation the message 'Displaying next entry in scan list' will
be displayed briefly, and then the next entry will be displayed.
     If only one entry matched your search string, or the entry being
displayed is the last entry which matches, if you try to continue the
program will inform you that there are no more matching entries and
return you to the main menu.
