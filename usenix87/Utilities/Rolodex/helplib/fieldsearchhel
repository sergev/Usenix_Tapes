You have asked to search the rolodex database by some other item than name.
For instance, if you wanted to find people who worked in Cambridge, you could
select the 'Work Address' item and use as a search string 'Cambridge'.  If
this is not what you want to do type '\' RETURN to get back to the main menu.

To select an item to search by, type the number of the item.  It will
then prompt you for a search string.  Type in what you want to search
for followed by RETURN.  The program will then show you the entries that
it has found that match your search criteria.

(Advanced feature) You can search by items which you have defined, as well as
the standard items.  The last choice is not a standard item but an option to
allow you to type in the name of your own user-defined item name.  For
instance, if your rolodex database contained 'Net Address' items, you could
search for Net Addresses containing 'ihnp4' by selecting the last choice
and typing in 'Net Address' RETURN, followed by 'ihnp4' RETURN at the
appropriate prompts.
