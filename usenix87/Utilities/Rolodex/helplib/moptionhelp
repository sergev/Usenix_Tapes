     This is the TMC Rolodex, an online way to store and retrieve information
about people you know, and other important pieces of data.
     Data is stored in units called entries..  There will generally be an entry
for each person in your rolodex.  Inside entries are items.  Items store such
things as a person's name, his phone number(s), and address(es).  You can
change items or add new ones.  You can create or delete entire entries also.
     At any time you can type the character '\' followed by RETURN to abort
what you are currently doing.  Most of the time '?' or 'help' followed by
RETURN will get you more information on what you are expected to type in next.
     If for some reason you wish to terminate the rolodex program without
saving any changes you have made, hold down the CTRL key and type 'c'.

     When you are searching for information, typing in any part of the
information that uniquely identifies it is good enough.  For instance, if you
were looking for John Finklesnort, typing 'John' is probably not a good idea
because you probably have a few names that contain 'John', but typing 'Finkle'
or 'snort' will probably uniquely identify the entry you want.  The search
program is completely case-insensitive.
     The rolodex search is completely case-insensitive (e.g., searching for
'Finkle' is the same as searching for 'finkle' is the same as 'fInKLe').
