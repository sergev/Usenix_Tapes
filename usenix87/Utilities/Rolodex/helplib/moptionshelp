This is the TMC Rolodex, an online way to store and retrieve information
about people you know, and other important pieces of data.

At any time you can type the character '\' followed by RETURN to abort
what you are currently doing.  Most of the time '?' or 'help' followed by
RETURN will get you more information on what you are expected to type in
next.

At the Top Level Menu, which you are currently at, you can type the following:

'+'     to begin entering information about a new person.
'%'     to begin scanning your rolodex, entry by entry.
'!'     to print out your rolodex in a nice format.
'*'     to save any changes you have made to your rolodex.
'\'     to exit the rolodex program.
