At this point you can type the following:

the RETURN key.
the 'n' key followed by RETURN.
the '\' (backslash) key followed by RETURN.

If you used the rolodex program by typing something like 'rolo john'
then typing RETURN will find for you the next person in your rolodex
who has the letters 'john' as part of their name.

If you used the rolodex program by typing something like 'rolo john mary'
then typing 'n' after the program had displayed one of the people whose
name contained 'john' would stop the program from looking for any more
'john's and start looking for 'mary'.

If you just wish to exit the program type the backslash character.
