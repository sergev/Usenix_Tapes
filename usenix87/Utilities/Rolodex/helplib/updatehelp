You have asked to change some information contained in the entry that was
being displayed before you typed '+'.  If this is not what you want type '\'
RETURN to get back to the main menu.

Currently, the program is displaying the name of each item in the entry and
its contents (some items may have no contents).  Each item is numbered.
Simply type the number of the item whose contents you wish to change.  The
program will then display the old contents of the item and ask you to type in
some text which will become the new contents.  Once you have done this for
each item you wish to change, type RETURN when it again asks for you an item
number.  It will then print out the revised entry one more time, and ask you
to confirm all your changes.  You can abort all your changes for this entry at
any time by typing '\' RETURN.

You can also add new items to this entry.  The last numbered choice is not an
item name but an option to allow you to do this.  Type this number (now 8) and
you will be prompted for the name and contents of a new field.  For instance
you might want to add an item called 'Net Address' with a value 'cca!alex'.
When prompted you would type 'Net Address: cca!alex' RETURN.  You stop adding
new items by typing just a RETURN.
