*** amusing & useful program ***

What follows is an amusing and useful program to repeatedly execute
command(s) and display their output on the screen...overlaying
subsequent output on preceding output...thus, you can watch something
change over time.  The default (expensively) is "ps -af"...so that
you can watch the system change.  There are all sorts of interesting
variations and modifications possible...please send them to me.  In
releasing this (simple) source please keep my name in it.  Finally,
we don't have 'nroff' or 'man' macros to make a real man page.
