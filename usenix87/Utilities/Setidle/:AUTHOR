This is a program which allows a user to set and maintain a specified idle
time on his tty.  The default (giving no parameters) sets the idle time to
zero every 10 minutes.  It is useful for those who need to maintain control
on their idle time without being present at their terminals.

To use the program one types:
        setidle [idle time] [update time]

I hope this finds use with some of you out there.
