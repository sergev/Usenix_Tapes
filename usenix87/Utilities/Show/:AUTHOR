This is an echo like command that has some of the features that the
older echo commands had (like -n) as well as some new features. While
I was writing this I found some things in the System V echo command
that looked like bugs. For instance if you type 'echo \\0077' you get
a '?'. The way that the manual entry reads I expected a bell followed
by a '7'. In show you get a bell followed by a '7'. Show is based on
a version of echo that was posted to net.sources which had a -q flag
to prevent the echoing of the arguments. This feature is retained. I
found that the System V echo will not echo its arguments if you type
'echo \\c args', and show has this feature also.
