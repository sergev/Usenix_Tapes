This program originally appeared in the May 1984 issue of Byte Magazine.  It
was originally written in Pascal by Marco Caceci and William Caceris at Florida
State University.  I have translated it to 'C'.

This program is based upon the Simplex curve fitting algorithm.  For a detailed
descripstion of this program and it's workings see the above mentioned article.

I acknowledge the work of Marco Caceci and William Caceris for writing the
original Pascal program from which this is derived.  The original authors
explicitly stated ''no copy-right''.

I've had some problems with accuracy.  I've checked and rechecked my source
code and I can't find anything that would account for it.  I could very well be
overlooking something, though.  I suppose it could have to do with differences
in the precision of the floating-point libraries of the authors Pascal compiler
(Pascal/Z Version 4.0 CP/M) and my C compiler (Xenix 3.0).  I welcome E-mail
on this subject.  Nevertheless, the differences in values returned between
the original and mine are comparatively small.

I hope this helps someone in Netland.
