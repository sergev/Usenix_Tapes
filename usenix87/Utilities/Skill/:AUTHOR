	`skill' is a program which sends signals to processes given
any combination of usernames, ttys, commands, and pids.  It is based
on ps(1) and kill(1), but its command line that is completely order
independent.  It's been used on Vaxen and a CCI running BSD 4.2/3 as
well as Sun 2/3 Workstations.

The syntax is an extended version of kill(1):

	skill [-<signal>] [-i] [-v] [-w] {<tty> <user> <pid> <command>}

but there is absolutely no order placed on anything.  It is popular with
system administrators, systems programmers, and the user community in
general.  There are a million uses for it if you think about it.  I tried
to make the program as easy to use as possible, it basically works like
kill(1) except that you can specify commands, ttys, and usernames as well
as process ids.

The name stems from `SuperKILL', but if you use it under `csh', you'll
discover another reason for calling it `skill' (hint "s!!").  ANyways,
I think you'll like it...
