	`skill' is a program which sends signals to processes given
any combination of usernames, ttys, commands, and pids.  It is based
on ps(1) and kill(1), but its command line that is completely order
independent.  Also, there is an interactive and verbose mode of
operation.

`skill' has been tested and on Vaxen and a CCI running BSD 4.2/3
as well as Sun 2/3 Workstations.  One (and only one) of these
defines must be selected:

	BSD4_2	- 4.2 BSD system
	BSD4_3	- 4.3 BSD system
	SUN2	- Sun 2 Workstation
	SUN3	- Sun 3 Workstation

See the makefile for more information.  Besides this "Readme" file,
there is a (Makefile), the source file (skill.c), and a manual page
(skill.1).

If you modify "skill" and feel that it would be beneficial to others
who use this program, or if you find and fix a bug, feel free to send
me the change!  Thanks!!
