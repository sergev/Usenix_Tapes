	This is the nth rewrite of stat(1), which I believe was originally
written by Phil Hochstetler (now of Sequent).  Essentially, it prints out
the structure returned by stat(2).  Defining SINCE will cause stat(1) to
print the difference between "now" and "then" for each of the three dates
associated with the inode--this is probably easy to demo than to explain.

	Here's a sample of the output:
-----
  File: "."
  Size: 2048         Allocated Blocks: 4            Filetype: Directory
  Mode: (0751/drwxr-x--x)         Uid: (18506/     rsk)  Gid: (    4/   staff)
Device: 5      Inode: 41167     Links: 3    
Access: Sat Jul 13 09:54:12 1985(00000.00:04:11)
Modify: Sat Jul 13 09:58:22 1985(00000.00:00:01)
Change: Sat Jul 13 09:58:22 1985(00000.00:00:01)

	The times in ()'s are generated by the SINCE-defined code; note
that they are of the format ddddd.hh.mm.ss, which should be more than
sufficient to cover times back as far as the Epoch.

	Please report bugs to me; also please note that this is for 4.2bsd;
although I have little doubt that it would be easily adaptable to other
species--such mods are also welcome in my mailbox.
