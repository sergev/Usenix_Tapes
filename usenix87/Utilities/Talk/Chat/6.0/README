Files included in this directory are as follow:

     main.c misc.c page.c ttyset.c cursub.c send.c readmsg.c

        These files are the source code for the chat system.  After
Chat has been compiled it must be setuid to "root" or another
system user with read-write permission on the directory in which
the LOGFILE is stored.  (See defs.h)

        defs.h

        This file contains all the major Chat system variables. Included
are:

MAXUSERS        = Maximum amount of users in a single chat session.
LOGFILE         = User file for chat.  Similar to /etc/utmp in nature.
PREFIX          = The prefix and directory name for system buffers.
FNAME           = File containg list of users logged in host system (utmp)
PAGER           = The utility to notify other system users.
SYSTEMFILE      = ** File which holds "squelch" information. And info. on
                  system status. (See following comments).

	chat.1

	Manual page for Chat.  Formatted in man macros.

        cwho.c

        Source for a small utility which prints a list of users logged
into the Chat system  This file requires no special permission.

        ruser.c

        Due to some system malfunctions and/or screwups, on rare
occasions a user may not be removed from the LOGFILE.  The drawback
is that messages still get sent to the user's buffer and could
account for a lenghty /tmp file.   If such an occurance ever happens
this utility will allow you to delete the user from the LOGFILE without
disturbing any other system users in chat.  This has only 
happened once during he duration of Chat's development.  But I included
the utility just in case.
------

        In the rare event that it is necessary to take the Chat system
down it may be accomplished by simply using a standard editor on the
Chat SYSTEMFILE and adding  the line:

system-down

        When called up Chat will display a system down notice
and exit.   This is a hangover from the development stage and I have
found no practical use otherwise - enjoy it anoyhow.

        In the case of a system user abusing the Chat system
or the users on it,  he/she may be denied access until the owner
feels confident that the user has straightened out.  This is a last
resort.  The perferred methind would be to communicate wih the
user in question first.  If that dosen't seem to work then you
may remove their access.

        To remove a user's access simply add a line to the
chat SYSTEMFILE saying

squelch username

Where username is the user in question.  When the user tries
to enter Chat they will be given a notice regarding removal of
access.
