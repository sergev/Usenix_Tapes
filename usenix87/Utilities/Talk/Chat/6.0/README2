To get Chat up and running:

	#1 unpack and rummage through the Makefile.  Tailor it to your
		needs.

	#2 Edit and change "defs.h" to suit your particular system.

	#3 Type "make" and sit back and watch the fun.

If you defined what you wanted the makefile to do for installation type
"make install" and that will move Chat, and it's subprograms, to the
destination directory. Along with changing it to the correct permissions.

Other important stuff is in README2.
