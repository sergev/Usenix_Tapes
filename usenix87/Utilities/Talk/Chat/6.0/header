*       This is a copy of the Chat system developed at Brookhaven           *
*  National Labs (Later drastically improved at my house) to allow a        *
*  group conversation between users.                                        *
*                                                                           *
*       A very early version of this program was released a while           *
*  ago and I apologize to all the non-V7 people who struggled with it.      *
*       This version (6.0) was developed on both a PDP-11/44 and an AT&T    *
*  UNIX PC. So, I can almost guarentee no problems with sysV or V7.         *
*   For 4.x BSD there should be little or no modifications to make.         *
*                                                                           *
*       6.0 adds a few goodies like wordwrap, accessing of the termcap      *
*  library for special functions, and an overall enhancement in the way it  *
*  works.                                                                   *
