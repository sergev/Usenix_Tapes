The hey(1) program, published in the October 1985 Unix/World's magazine's
Wizard Grabbag column, attempts to contact a particular person by writing to
all terminals that s/he is using.  To save the net some typing, here's a
(slightly improved) machine-readable copy.

The version packed as "hey" in this bundle is a superset of the one published
in the magazine.  The new one handles a -n option to look you up all over the
(4.2BSD-style) network.  The published magazine version looks only on the local
system, and is packed here as "hey.local".  The enclosed man page documents the
networked version.

I haven't seen the issue yet, but I received mail asking for the networked copy
so I guess it's been published.  I recently updated the man page with better
English, so this copy is more up-to-date.  I don't know if there have been any
bugs introduced by the publishing process (copy is frequently mangled in its
travel from the submittal to the final page), so trust this version.

PS:	I'm hoping to start a trend here.  If you send sources to a magazine,
	please send duplicates to mod.sources when they're published (if the
	magazine's editors don't mind).
