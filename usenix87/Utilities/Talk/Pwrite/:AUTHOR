Gentlepeople:

	After completing a software design course, which involved a 
	software project using sockets, I decided to do a little spare
	time hacking myself in order to produce this multi-user "talk"
	program. I thought it would be an interesting project because
	I could learn the use of 4.2BSD sockets and because talk(1)
	only handles two people and requires a driver.

	Do whatever you want with this piece of software, but please leave
	the comments in main.c undisturbed.

	A few notes:

	1)	In evals.c, in e_ring(), change the command for pwrite
		from ~puchyr/com/pwrite to an appropriate path.

	2)	The following is a shell archive file. make a directory
		and save this file in it. Edit this file and remove
		the top portion of this file up to and including the
		----cut here---- line. Then use the command:

		sh this_file

		Do not run this file through csh. It must be fed to the
		Bourne shell.

	3)	You should end up a number of C programs, a Makefile, and
		a pwrite.man manual entry. use the command:

		make

		to compile the programs. An 'a.out' will result.


	If anyone comes with bug fixes please post them to the net.
