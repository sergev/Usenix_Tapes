NAME
     pwrite - multi-user ``talk'' program

SYNOPSIS
     pwrite

DESCRIPTION
     _P_w_r_i_t_e allows a user to communicate with a number of other
     users who are logged into the computer. There are no command
     line arguments for _p_w_r_i_t_e.  After entering _p_w_r_i_t_e, a box or
     window labeled with your username and terminal tty will
     appear in the upper left portion of your screen. There are
     two modes in _p_w_r_i_t_e, talk mode, and command mode. The ESCAPE
     button functions as a toggle switch between talk mode and
     command mode. The following commands are available in com-
     mand mode.

     a         - Add a user. A ``ghost'' window will appear on
               the screen.  When adding a user, the user's name
               or the user's terminal tty number are valid
               inputs. Ghost windows, drawn with dotted lines,
               are used to indicate incomplete connections.

     d         - Delete a connection. Deleting yourself will exit
               you from the program.

     r         - Ring. All unanswered connections, ghost windows,
               are rung by sending a note to the expected users.
               [NO RING] appears if a user has his write permis-
               sion off. You are free to ring as frequently or
               infrequently as you wish.

     w         - See who is on the system.

     ?         - Help. A few help windows are displayed in the
               lower right area of the screen.

     _P_w_r_i_t_e allows a maximun of 12 windows on the screen. You are
     free to change the windows within command mode.  Included in
     command mode are four corner posts, [ [  ] ] , which are
     used as sights for changing windows. The window on which
     they are placed is called the _c_u_r_r_e_n_t _w_i_n_d_o_w.  The commands
     for customizing the windows within command mode are:

     h j k l   - Moves the sights left (h), down (j), up (k), or
               right (l) respectively.

     H J K L   - Changes size by moving the lower right sight
               left, down, up, or right while holding the upper
               left sight stationary.

     SPACE     - Select current window. With a number of windows

               on your screen, pressing SPACE will allow you to
               select a different current window.

     @         - Actually move and resize the current window to
               fit within the four sights.  Moving the sights
               alone will not change the current window's loca-
               tion or size.  The @ command does.

FILES
     /tmp/.pw_*               - communication sockets

SEE ALSO
     talk(1), mesg(1)

BUGS
     _P_w_r_i_t_e is heavily dependent on sockets.

     The program tends to boldly state that the current Universe
     is defective. This is done when an unknown SIGPIPE error
     ocurrs with the sockets.
