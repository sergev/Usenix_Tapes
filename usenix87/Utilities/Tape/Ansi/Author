The following magtape handling package will read and write ANSI standard
labelled tapes in various formats, copy tapes even when you have only one
tape unit, survey odd tapes, read Cyber NOS system format tapes and do
some other useful things.  It has been used extensively on a PDP11/45
and on a VAX 750, UNIX V7 and 4.1BSD.

The following sharchive (excusez le mot) contains, among the usual files,
one file which is a demonstration tape image; it is pure ASCII96, and thus
it does not contain newlines.  I do not know how well it will survive the
various uucp's on its journey, but it is the last file in the sharchive and
it is not essential to the package.
