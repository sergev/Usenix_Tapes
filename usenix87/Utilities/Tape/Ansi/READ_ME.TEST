SALES TALK
        If you have one or more magtape units and want to do more with
them than just run `tar', this is for you.

        On the `shell' level this package offers programs for
  - getting a quick look at a tape,
  - making exact copies of tapes even if you've got only one magtape
    unit,
  - extracting arbitrary portions from tapes and
  - the reading and writing of ANSI standard labelled tapes.
All these programs work equally well on real tapes and on tape images
on disk.

        On the C-level it supplies routines for handling real tapes and
tape images on disk as a unified concept (`generalized magtape').

INSTALLATION
        Take a look at the 4 small files

        tploc.h  tprdloc.c  tpwloc.c  tpwtmloc.c

and decide if they look reasonable on your system. If not, change them
or use the files `tp*LOC.?' which come from the PDP11/45. Then call
`make all' and the shell commands as described in mag(I) will appear.
        To install the shell commands, change the macro USR (and
possibly BIN, LIB, and INC) in the `makefile' and do `make install'. To
install the C-routine library `libt.a', do `make crout'.

        Now do

        ansir -fp test.image

to get a feel for what it does. (Then do it a second time!).

CYBER
        If you happen to have a Control Data Cyber around, running
SCOPE or NOS/BE, call `make NOS' to get `NOSsplit', a program for
reading Cyber SI-format tapes, and `NOStr' which converts from various
Cyber character codes.
