     This is a program that I've had around for some time, but never
really did anything with before.  I use it for transferring data
between VAX/VMS, IBM MVS, and Unix 4.2BSD.  It works well for me, but
someone out there is likely to find a bug.

     In particular, I could not get a full copy of the ANSI magtape
standards, so I did the best I could by testing to see what would
work.  I think this does enough to be useful in most cases, though.

     I'm not in the support business, but I would like to hear about
bugs.  As time permits, I'll try to fix them.  Updates will be
published in mod.sources, using 'patch' formats.  I'd like to do the
'official' patches here, so everyone doesn't end up with custom
(incompatible) changes.

     This software was developed on Government time, and is therefore
freely available to the public.  (It's even covered under the Freedom
of Information Act, if anyone ever cared to ask for it.)

Hope someone finds this useful.
