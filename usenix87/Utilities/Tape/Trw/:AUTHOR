eeerrrrr   uuuummmmmm

It seems I forgot to include a couple of files in my earlier posting
of trw.  This one IS complete.

But also, I *HAD* posted the missing files to net.sources.bugs as
soon as I found out that something was missing.  However, it seems
that some people missed those postings.  So, I'm posting the whole
thing again (Don't worry, it's not large).
