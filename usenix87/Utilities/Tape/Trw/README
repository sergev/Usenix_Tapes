As it says in the manual page, this program was written by Karen Cross
and Rosemarie Maruskan.  Neither of them attend UK any longer.  Karen
works at IBM so is unreachable by Unix mail.  Rosemarie however is on
Usenet as: hplabs!hpfcla!hpfcrj!rose.

It's been tested with both IBM labeled tapes and ANSI tapes.  (Though,
note the qualification in the manual page).

Questions can be sent to Rose at the above address, or me (David Herron,
cbosgd!ukma!david).

By The Way.  The options are of the form name=value because Karen
likes IBM operating systems, not because they'd been using dd(1) a lot.
Though, they HAD been doing some of that also.
