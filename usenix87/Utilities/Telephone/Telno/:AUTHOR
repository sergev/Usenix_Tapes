This is a little bit of fluff that arose in the course of a night of
imbibing inspriational spirits; I'm sure it's been done before.

Simply enough, it takes a telephone number and provides all possible
permutations of the letters on the dial keycaps.  It doesn't attempt to
be nifty and throw out combinations that aren't pronouncable; you've got
a neat array processor of your own that's quite a bit faster at complex
pattern recognition than the poor program.  Besides, I was too hazy to
think that hard...  The person who asked if this was possible is happy;
that's as far as I'm going to take this thing.

As I say, I only apologize slightly for the code quality; I'm rather
amazed that it worked...
