A while ago, I posted an alarmer for use with suntools.  Well, with the advent
of Daylight Savings Time, I found a bug.  Another bug happens when the alarm
rings for a long time; something about pixrect allocating too much space.  Ths
bug fix for this is a kludge: the icon flashes for a while, stops, flashes
again, ...  If anyone has a better fix (short of making the whole thing a
tool), please let me know. 

Compile the program as

	cc -O -s -o alarm -DSUN -DICON_DIR=\"icon directory\" alarm.c

Not defining SUN gives an alarmer for standard terminals that rings the bell
and prints the message on the screen.  When you use this version, don't forget
to kill the process before you logout.
