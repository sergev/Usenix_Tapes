Archive-name: settz.patch

[  Volume 4 #14 is "settz," a program that generates datafiles with
   detailed timezone information.  With the recent change in US law,
   this topic has been under renewed discussion, especially in
   net.unix-wizards and mod.std.unix.  If you missed the original
   settz posting, please contact your nearest mod.sources archive
   site.  --r$]
