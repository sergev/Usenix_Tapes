# Bob Devine has written that ". . .your table is wrong for MostNA in 1974.
# The correct ending date is 10/27 not 11/24."  Yet on a 4.1bsd VAX/11-750
# system, compiling and executing the program
#
#	#include "time.h"
#
#	long l = 152592000;
#
#	main() {
#		struct tm *	tmp;
#
#		tmp = localtime(&l);
#		printf("%s", asctime(tmp));
#		printf("isdst: %d\n", tmp->tm_isdst);
#	}
#
# results in the output
#
#	Fri Nov  1 22:40:00 1974
#	isdst: 1
#
# For now we'll stay with 4.1bsd's version.
#
# Note also this from munnari!kre:
# "I recall also being told by someone once that Canada didn't have
# the DST variations in 74/75 that the US did, but I am not nearly
# sure enough of this to add anything."

# If Canada or Mexico decide not to follow the US change in DST that takes
# effect in 1987, additions had best be made below.

# Before the Uniform Time Act of 1966 took effect in 1967, observance of
# Daylight Saving Time in the US was by local option, except during wartime.

# Standard time was change by half an hour in 1947; this accounts for
