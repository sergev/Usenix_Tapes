.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Tzset
uses the value of the environment variable
.B TZ
to set time conversion information used by
.IR localtime .
.if \nX \{\
IF
.B TZ
is absent from the environment,
the behavior is implementation defined.
If
.B TZ
does appear in the environment,
.I localtime
will only work correctly if
its value is one of an
implementation-defined set of values.
\}
.if !\nX \{\
If
.B TZ
does not appear in the environment,
the best available approximation to local wall clock time is used by
.IR localtime .
If
.B TZ
appears in the environment but its value is a null string,
Greenwich Mean Time is used;
if
.B TZ
appears and
begins with a slash,
it is used as the absolute pathname of the
.IR tzfile (5)-format
file from which to read the time conversion information;
if
.B TZ
appears and
begins with a character other than a slash,
it's used as a pathname relative to a system time conversion information
directory.
\}
.PP
.I Tzsetwall
sets things up so that
.I localtime
returns the best available approximation of local wall clock time.
.PP
.I Ctime\^
converts a long integer, pointed to by
.IR clock ,
representing the time in seconds since
00:00:00 GMT, January 1, 1970,
and returns a pointer to a
26-character string
of the form
.br
.ce
Thu Nov 24 18:22:48 1986\\n\\0
.br
All the fields have constant width.
.PP
.IR Localtime\^
and
.I gmtime\^
return pointers to ``tm'' structures, described below.
.I Localtime\^
corrects for the time zone and any time zone adjustments
(such as Daylight Savings time in the U.S.A.).
.if \nX Whether, before doing so,
.if !\nX Before doing so,
.I localtime\^
calls
.I tzset\^
(if
.I tzset\^
has not been called in
.if \nX the current process) is implementation defined.
.if !\nX the current process).
.if !\nX \{\
After filling in the ``tm'' structure,
.I localtime
sets the
.BR tm_isdst 'th
element of
.B tzname
to a pointer to an 
ASCII string that's the time zone abbreviation to be used with
.IR localtime 's
return value.
\}
.PP
.I Gmtime\^
converts to Greenwich Mean Time (GMT).
.PP
.I Asctime\^
converts a time value contained in a
``tm'' structure to a 26-character string,
as shown in the above example,
and returns a pointer
to the string.
.PP
Declarations of all the functions and externals, and the ``tm'' structure,
are in the
.B <time.h>\^
header file.
The structure (of type)
.B struct tm
includes the following fields:
.RS
.PP
.nf
.ta .5i +\w'long tm_gmtoff;\0\0'u
	int tm_sec;	/\(** seconds (0 - 59) \(**/
	int tm_min;	/\(** minutes (0 - 59) \(**/
	int tm_hour;	/\(** hours (0 - 23) \(**/
	int tm_mday;	/\(** day of month (1 - 31) \(**/
	int tm_mon;	/\(** month of year (0 - 11) \(**/
	int tm_year;	/\(** year \- 1900 \(**/
	int tm_wday;	/\(** day of week (Sunday = 0) \(**/
	int tm_yday;	/\(** day of year (0 - 365) \(**/
	int tm_isdst;	/\(** is DST in effect? \(**/
	char \(**tm_zone;	/\(** abbreviation of timezone name \(**/
	long tm_gmtoff;	/\(** offset from GMT in seconds \(**/
.fi
.RE
.PP
The
.I tm_zone
and
.I tm_gmtoff
fields exist, and are filled in, only if arrangements to do
so were made when the library containing these functions was
created.
There is no guarantee that these fields will continue to exist
in this form in future releases of this code.
.PP
.I Tm_isdst\^
is non-zero if a 
time zone adjustment such as Daylight Savings time
is in effect.
.PP
.I Tm_gmtoff
is the offset (in seconds) of the time represented
from GMT, with positive values indicating East
of Greenwich.

.SH NOTE
The return values point to static data
whose content is overwritten by each call.
The
.B tm_zone
field of a returned
.B "struct tm"
points to a static array of characters, which
will also be overwritten at the next call
(and by calls to
.I tzset
or
.IR tzsetwall ).
