[Don't people have better stuff to do than write dumb clock programs? :-)]

Here's a little beastie I hacked up in about 15 minutes after seeing the analog
clock program posted to the net a week ago.  (It then took me a week to get the
bugs worked out -- I forgot to #include <math.h>.) Anyway, maybe someone else
will enjoy it. 

If you're running on 4.2, kill the line containing system("stty echoe").  If
you're on a Sun, throw this bugger out and use suntools.  (:-)
