Several people have been asking for a touch-type program. I wrote this a
long time ago (and posted it back then). It used to be called 'type' but
should be renamed 'ttype' to avoid conflict with the shell's builtin.
The instructions are on line and it needs -lcurses and -ltermcap. It should
work on any BSD system with very few modifications.
