[The README files for 1.00.01 and 1.00.00 are included below.]

This is the UNaXcess Conferencing 1.00.02 distribution.  It provides bug
fixes to the 1.00.01 distribution.

The installation instructions have not changed; see the included README files
below.

There were six primary fixes:

(1) Private messages were still broken.  Code was added in conference.c to
    fix this.

(2) Conference membership had a bug; while I had known about it, I had thought
    it was an I/O bug.  Code was changed in conference.c to fix this.

(3) Panics were not dumping core as they should have.  Code was added to
    system.c to correct this; also, a "double-panic" quick exit was provided
    to forestall infinite loops.

(4) The format of the "directory" file was incorrect in install.sh and in
    admin.man.  Fixed, albeit via what can only be termed a hack in install.
    At least UA-Conf doesnt' do anything other than print dates.

(5) The terminal handling code in io.c had some casts that were mangled by
    Ultrix cc (VAX 8600 and MicroVAX II); this resulted in a warning from
    the Ultrix assembler, and caused UA-Conf to go into convulsions on start-
    up.  The casts were removed; I hope DEC fixes its compiler soon.

(6) Yet another locking fix.  If you still get "UNaXcess internal error:
    LOCKFILE DELETED" messages, let me know; I haven't had a lock work in
    this thing since I used Xenix semaphores back in V0.3.3.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[The README file for 1.00.00 is included below.]

This is the UNaXcess 1.00.01 distribution.  It provides bug fixes and enhance-
ments to the 1.00.00 distribution; however, enough was changed that a new
distribution was a good idea.

Read the various manuals and the Makefile, as well as the 1.00.00 README
below, for information on installing this program.

NOTE!!!  If you already have UNaXcess 1.00.00 or 0.4.x, you must run the
script reinstall.sh after you run install.sh, in order to upgrade your
ua-config and userfile to the new version.  To run it, become the owner of
the BBS system and issue the command "sh reinstall.sh /path/to/BBS".  It will
figure out whether you are using an alternate BBS directory.

Enjoy.  ++Brandon

P.S.  There is now a mailing list for UNaXcess; if you wish to subscribe, send
mail to "cbatt!cwruecmp!ncoast!unaxcess-request" or to
"ncoast!unaxcess-request%Case.CSNET@relay.CS.NET", as your system (UUCP or
Internet) requires.  Submissions may be sent to the user "unaxcess" at the
above-named site.

===============================================================================

This is the UNaXcess 1.00.00 distribution.  It is not in its "final" form yet;
I have to rewrite the UDL module, and I expect to add the UANet interface as
soon as possible; this, however, will require me to develop a replacement for
"sendmail" on those systems (e.g. V7, System III/V) which don't have it.  (And
perhaps for those that do, given the horror stories...)  There will also be
new administration commands forthcoming.

There are three manuals included in this distribution:

(1) The UNaXcess Installation Manual, which explains the installation
    procedure.  This replaces the old README file, and is much more readable.

(2) The UNaXcess User's Manual, an nroff'ed version of which is automatically
    placed in the UDL area by the installation script.  This guides the user
    through UNaXces in more detail than the help messages and help files.

(3) The UNaXcess Administrator's Manual, which guides the administrator
    through the process of maintaining UNaXcess.

The "noautopath" mode is still supported, but it may disappear in the future,
since it interferes strongly with UNaXcess security.
