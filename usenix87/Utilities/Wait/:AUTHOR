This is a (Bourne) shell file that I've found to be quite useful.  When called
as 'ww command' it keeps running 'command' in a loop until it output changes,
then beeps and exits:
	ww 'who | grep someone'

tells when 'someone' logs in/out.

When run as 'wu command' (wu is a link to ww), it runs 'command' as long as its
output keeps changing, as in:
	wu ls -l incoming_uucp_file

tells when data stops coming.

Flags:	-t sec	- run 'command' every 'sec' seconds (default 60)
	-v	- (wu only) show 'command's output every time (default - show
		  only the final output).

A useful combination is:
	wu -v -t 0 ww command &

Runs 'command' in the background, reporting progress every time anything
changes.
