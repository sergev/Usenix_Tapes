[  This program does not use the portable directory access routines,
   and references a <values.h> file.  I didn't notice any "non-generic"
   curses calls (e.g., curses/terminfo, PD curses, etc.), but I'm
   not sure that I would.  I will happily publish a set of context
   diffs if someone ports this to 4.[23]BSD.  --r$ ]

I've found this program pretty useful in testing an application with
lots of asynchronous processes creating spool files and writing logs.

Essentially it allows you to do multiple "tail -f"s with each one in a
separate window on the screen.  Watch also allows you to "tail" a
directory and see files as soon as they appear in the directory.

Each window can have an wakeup alarm set to go off on any output to the
window - useful if you want to look at something more interesting.

Have fun!
