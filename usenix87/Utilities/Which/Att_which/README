Version 1.0

This is another C implementation of the 'which' command, written because
(a) is was easy, (b) I didn't know how to find the original, and (c) HP-UX
on the 9000 series 300 and 500 doesn't have it.

To install, unshar into an empty directory, edit the Makefile to change the
DESTDIR (probably to /usr/local, /usr/local/bin or /usr/ucb), then su and
type 'make install'.  If all goes well type 'make clean' or even 'rm *' if
you saved the distribution kit.
