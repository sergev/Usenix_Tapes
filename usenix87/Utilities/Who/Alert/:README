Here's the source to alert. It works on 4.2 BSD Unix presently.
(It relies on sockets and on the utmp file, so it should be easy to port 
to any version that has them).
To all those who asked for it:
Read the file "INSTALL" and the man page "alert.8" before trying to install
these programs.
There are a couple of additional comments:
a. if alert cannot connect upto the server. Check the version of 
   /usr/include/netdb.h you are currently using and modify the call to 
   bcopy in alert.c accordingly.
b. if you are running inetd, you might have to modify alertd.c to make
   minor changes to make it run under inetd.

You can also include yourself and your friends to the char *wheels[] 
array in alert.c.

I should also thank Barry Shein at BU who wrote the gdate() routine.
