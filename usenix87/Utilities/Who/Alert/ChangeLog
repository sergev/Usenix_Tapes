	* fix bug in do_update that caused alertd to hang trying to send a
	mesage to a terminal out of which the luser had already logged
	out. this caused lossage wrt pseudo ttys attached to supdup..

	* the hunter data structure made completely consistent with the
	u_tab structure. Both mirror the same structure now. The former
	contains an array of character strings representing users that the
	present hunter is watching and the latter contains an array of tty
	line entries in which the user is presently logged in. 
 
        * Efficiency notes: For dynamic allocation, using a fixed free
	list scheme is much faster than mallocing and freeing. The new
	utils.c is kludgy but it is faster than the version that relied on
	Knuth's free list algorithm. Probably because it has a larger
	overhead on deletions which dont happen often. compare nutils.c
	with utils.c for details.
		 

	* fixed bug in parse.c that caused the new fascist routine
	print-hunters to barf. (infinite loop). do we need this fascist
	set of functions or should the world know about everything?

	* fixed bug in utils.c when starting with a utmp file that has no
	entries in it. (This causes a minor bug in the printout, before
	alertd has run after the first user has logged in). 

	* debugged and finished version 1.0 contains support for the
	following :
	1. utils.c new implementation of do_update that reads the utmp
	file and does the appropriate thing.
	2. time.c contains routines to add an alarm to a list of alarms
	and such. gdate.c contains support routines to parse a date string
	into internal Unix format.
	3. hunt.c contains code to manipulate list of hunters.

	* utils.c - contains main function that hacks the utmp file.
	the utab functions now use a simpleminded free list scheme.
	minor bugs fixed in ttyline code.
