There are two programs that need installing;
Edit "Makefile" to taste.
Edit "alertd.c" to contain the proper value for "LOGFILE";
Type "make install";

This should make and install
a. alertd
	This contains the server program.
b. alert	
	This contains the client.
You have to add a line to /etc/services of the form
alert		513/tcp		#experimental?
If you are running inetd make the similar mod to /etc/inetd.conf
(the sources to alertd may need minor changes too, but they are trivial to
make;)
You can also add a line to /etc/rc.local so that alertd is brought
up by default always as follows:
if [ -f /etc/alertd   ]; then
	/etc/alertd -s & echo -n ' alertd'                      >/dev/console
fi

Now you are all set; 
As usual, bugs/comments/enhancements to sundar@hermes.ai.mit.edu
