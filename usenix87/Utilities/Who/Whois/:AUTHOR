This sharfile contains a client and server for "whois."
The server does little more than just pass off the request to
the "finger" program, but that's enough.
The client is a from-scratch writing of whois.  It replaced
the standard "whois" because (a) we're not on ARPA (sri-nic is
useless to us)  and (b) I wanted to be able to say "whois rs@mirror"
and have it work.

Please MAIL me any bugs or problems you find...
