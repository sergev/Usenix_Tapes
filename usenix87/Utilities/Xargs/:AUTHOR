Here is a reimplementation of the System V utility xargs.  I haven't
heard any complaints about it, though [1] There is room for improvement
regarding the command buffer size (tho' it is better than the System V
area in that particular regard) [2] It does not have all the features
of the System V version (as the man page points out).
