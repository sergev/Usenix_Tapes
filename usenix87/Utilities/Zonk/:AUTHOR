Zonk is particularly useful in stamping out runaway processes.
Here is the source for the system call and user program, and man pages.
We added the system code to the end of sys/kern_exit.c; you'll
have to modify other files to support the new call (sys/init_sysent.c,
sys/syscalls.c under 4.2).  We use system call #154.
