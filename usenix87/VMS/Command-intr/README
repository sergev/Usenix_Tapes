1) This command interpreter consists of a lot of small command procedures,
   organized into directories.  Find a place to put it, such as a directory
   "tools" or the home directory of a dedicated user. 

   Create a directory "bin" for the general purpose command files (profile.com,
   def0.com, etc.) and a directory "vmx" with three subdirectories: "bin" for
   the .com files, "help" for the help files, "users" for the init files of all
   the users. 

2) Make sure that any user willing to use it has correct logical assignments in
   his login.com (and other init files run at login). 

	>  !--> file LOGIN.COM
	>  set noverify
	>  assign disk0:[root.z.bin] bin
	>  @bin:profile                   -- other logical assignments
	>  vmx  -- on the last line
	>  !<-- end LOGIN.COM

3) When you install this set of procedures for the first time, make sure to
   comment out the lines

	!on control_y then goto ...

   So that if anything goes wrong, you can still abort everything by ^Y. 

4) After you have tried all possible sorts of commands, remove the exclam marks
   so that control_y is handled. 

5) There is a command that any user can use to create his init file.
