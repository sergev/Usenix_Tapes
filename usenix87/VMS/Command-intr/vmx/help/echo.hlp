(help ECHO) ECHO echoes its arguments (up to 8) on sys$output.
ECHERR does the same on sys$error.

To echo more than 8 arguments, use \b as a blank, and \n
as a newline to separate arguments.

ECHO is most useful as the first command in a pipe, as in:

echo send \n John \n\n How are you today\b? | mail;

-- sends a short message to user John. (end help)
