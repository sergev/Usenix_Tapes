(help NICE) NICE and SEND are used to send batch jobs.
NICE sends a job consisting of a single command:
+command;

To submit a command file in batch, simply use:
+@command_file;

You can change vmx_nice in your init_file, so as to be notified
of the job being sent:
vmx_nice :== submit/id/log_file=[].res

And the extension of the log file:
res_extension    :== ".log"

Use RMJOB (:== del sys$batch/entry=) to abort a job.
Use B     (:== show queue sys$batch) to see the batch queue. (end help)
