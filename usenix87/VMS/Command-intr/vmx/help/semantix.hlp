(help SEMANTIX)
Any command line submitted to the shell from vmx, ie any command line
containing special characters, must contain at least one semicolon ";"
The semicolon serves to recognize which command lines are to be 
interpreted by the shell.

The period "." must be used instead of the semicolon to indicate
the version number, as in file.dat.1 (end help)
