These programs are of interest to VAX/VMS users who use both Ingres and
SAS.  It allows the transfer (awkward, but effective) of data from Ingres
to SAS.  SAS version 5 will allow the user to write a direct interface
between SAS and Ingres; the enclosed programs are a temporary measure.

Two files follow.  The first is INGTOSAS.QF, an equel/fortran program.
The second is INGTOSAS.HLP, a source file for a VMS help library.

We've used the program for a year without trouble.  (The features are
documented...).  Changes and suggestions are welcome.
