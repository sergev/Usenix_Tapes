	I am posting this game for a friend of mine. The game has been designed
	on VMS 4.4.
	The game has been  written in one module. To play it, delete this header
	until the --- line.
	To compile, type CC pig.c
	To link, you will have to define 3 libraries as follow:
	1) define lnk$library sys$library:vaxccurse
	2) define lnk$library_1 sys$library:vaxcrtlg
	3) define lnk$library_2 sys$library:vaxcrtl
	After defining those 3 libraries, you can type link pig and there 
	the program is ready to be run.

	For best visual effects, play it on a VT200 series terminal.
	Have fun !
