This is an old public domain version of rogue. I tried to leave it as is
except to make it run on vms. most of the Vms specifics are in io.c
it requires at least vms 4.0 and a 2.0 or newer C compiler with
curses. Vms curses does not work quite the same as Unix so there
were a few things to get arond there that are now different.


i don't care what the dec man say, vms can run games too...
