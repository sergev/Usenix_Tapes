A number at the beginning of a termcap string specifies a delay (in
milliseconds) which must follow the escape sequence so the terminal
doesn't drop subsequent characters sent to it.  The delay is accomplished
by transmitting repeatedly a pad character ('\0' by default).
An asterisk ('*') following that number means that this much delay
is needed for each affected line (LINES - y) or character.

The problem seems to be that the string returned by tgoto() was sent to
the terminal without sending it through tputs(), since tputs() interprets
termcap delays.  BTW, don't forget to set the

	extern short ospeed;

variable to tty.sg_ospeed (BSD/V7) or tty.c_cflag&CBAUD (USG).

Given:

outc(ch)	/* sends character to the terminal */
char ch;

then the appropriate fix would resemble this:

	tputs(tgoto(CM, col, row), 1, outc);
