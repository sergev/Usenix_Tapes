Summary: Let's end this silly topic


The real solution to fixing vtrek is to make it use curses.  I've got a fixed
version that runs perfectly well on an AT&T 3B2 running SysV with curses. If
I get enough requests, I'll post it.  BSD folks will probably have to change
a couple of lines in it (cbreak/crmode and incompatibilities like that), but
that shouldn't be real difficult.

It works faster too, if you're on a low-speed line.
