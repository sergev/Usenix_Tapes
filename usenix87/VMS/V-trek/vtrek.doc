           The galaxy is divided into a 8 X 8 quadrant grid, and
        each quadrant is further divided into a 8 X 8 sector grid.
           You will be assigned a starting point somewhere in the
        galaxy. Your mission : To seek out and destroy the fleet of
        Klingon warships which are menacing the Federation of Planets.

           You will have the following commands available to you as
        captain :

                'D','E','W','Q','A','Z','X','C' , the keys around the
                      'S' on the keyboard control your direction. When
                      you are asked for the direction, type one of these.

                                Q  W  E
                                 \ | /
                                  \|/
                               A --S-- D
                                  /|\
                                 / | \
                                Z  X  C

                'H' , Hyper-space , used when you want to travel a
                      large distance. The direction is set by typing
                      one of the keys around the 'S'. The warp factor
                      can be a number from 0-8.

                'S' , Short range scan , tells you the direction and
                      the distance that the Klingons are from you.
                      Anytime that your Short range sensors are working,
                      you will have a display of your quadrant on the
                      screen. The following symbols are used on the
                      display :

                                <K> - Klingon
                                <S> - Star Base (refuel/repair/re-arm here)
                                 *  - star
                                 ?  or (?) - you (? is the 1st letter of your
                                             ship name.)

                'L'   Long range scan.  Shows conditions in space for
                      one quadrant on each side of you (your in the
                      middle of the scan). The scan prints out up to
                      three digits for each quadrant.  The one's digit
                      is the number of stars, then tens digit is the
                      number of star bases, and the hundred's digit is
                      the number of Kilngons.

                      EXAMPLE : 207 , 2 Klingons, 0 star bases, 7 stars

                'P'   Fire phasers.  Allows you to destroy the Klingon
                      warships by zapping them with suitable amounts of
                      energy.

                'T'   Fire photon torpedo's.  Torpedo course is selected
                      by typing one of the keys around the 'S'. If the
                      torpedo hits the Klingon, he will be destroyed.

                'U'   Defense control.  Allows you to raise or lower your
                      shields. The power to your shields drops as you are
                      hit. If you are hit with your shields all the way
                      down (0), you WILL be destroyed. When your shields
                      up you will have paretheses around your ship.

		'F'   Fix devices.  This allows you to repair damaged devices
		      at a faster pace than normally.

                'R'   Redraw the screen.

           Impulse power can be used by typing one of the direction
        keys around the 'S'. This moves you the same distance as 
        Hyper-space with a warp of 0.1.
           In the upper right of the screen is a damage report. If
        something is damaged it will have a negative number beside it.
        If an item is damaged, you won't be able to use it.
