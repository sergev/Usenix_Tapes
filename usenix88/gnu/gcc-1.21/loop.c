/* This is the loop optimization pass of the compiler.
   It finds invariant computations within loops and moves them
   to the beginning of the loop.

   It also finds cases where
   a register is set within the loop by zero-extending a narrower value
   and changes these to zero the entire register once before the loop
   and merely copy the low part within the loop.

   Most of the complexity is in heuristics to decide when it is worth
