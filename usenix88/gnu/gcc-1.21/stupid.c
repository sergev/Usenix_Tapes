/* This file performs stupid register allocation, which is used
   when cc1 gets the -noreg switch (which is when cc does not get -O).

   Stupid register allocation goes in place of the the flow_analysis,
   local_alloc and global_alloc passes.  combine_instructions cannot
   be done with stupid allocation because the data flow info that it needs
   is not computed here.

   In stupid allocation, the only user-defined variables that can
   go in registers are those declared "register".  They are assumed
   to have a life span equal to their scope.  Other user variables
   are given stack slots in the rtl-generation pass and are not
   represented as pseudo regs.  A compiler-generated temporary
   is assumed to live from its first mention to its last mention.

   Since each pseudo-reg's life span is just an interval, it can be
   represented as a pair of numbers, each of which identifies an insn by
   its position in the function (number of insns before it).  The first
   thing done for stupid allocation is to compute such a number for each
   insn.  It is called the suid.  Then the life-interval of each
   pseudo reg is computed.  Then the pseudo regs are ordered by priority
   and assigned hard regs in priority order.  */
