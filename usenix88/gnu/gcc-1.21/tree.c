/* This file contains the low level primitives for operating on tree nodes,
   including allocation, list operations, interning of identifiers,
   construction of data type nodes and statement nodes,
   and construction of type conversion nodes.  It also contains
   tables index by tree code that describe how to take apart
   nodes of that code.

   It is intended to be language-independent, but occasionally
   calls language-dependent routines defined (for C) in typecheck.c.

   The low-level allocation routines oballoc and permalloc

   1) when truncating down to full-word from a larger size

   3) when at least one operand of the arithmetic has been extended

   truncate both and then combine.  Perhaps that way we need only one.

   Note that in general we cannot do the arithmetic in a type
   shorter than the desired result of conversion, even if the operands
   are both extended from a shorter type, because they might overflow
   if combined in that type.  The exceptions to this--the times when
