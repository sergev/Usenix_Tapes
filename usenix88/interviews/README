9                                    Version 2.3

                 This distribution contains four directories: _b_i_n,  _l_i_b,
            _s_r_c,  and _m_a_n.  The _b_i_n and _l_i_b directories are further sub-
            divided according to target machine and version  of  X.   We
            have  binaries  for VAX.X10, VAX.X11, and SUN3.X11.  The _s_r_c
            directory is divided into five subdirectories: _i_n_c_l_u_d_e, _l_i_b,
            _l_i_b_g_r_a_p_h_i_c,  _l_i_b_t_e_x_t,  and  _b_i_n.  All header files are under
            _i_n_c_l_u_d_e.  The general library classes are in _l_i_b, the struc-
            tured  graphics  classes  are  in  _l_i_b_g_r_a_p_h_i_c,  and text and
            structured text classes are in _l_i_b_t_e_x_t.  Each command is  in
            its  own  subdirectory  under _b_i_n.  We keep _i_n_c_l_u_d_e files in
            ``/usr/include/InterViews'', but you can  make  the  library
            and  programs  with the header files in a different place by
            creating a symbolic link  to  the  include  directory  named
            ``InterViews''.

                 The binaries for a source directory are built in a sub-
            directory  named  by  the target machine and X version.  For
            example, the _l_i_b directory  contains  a  subdirectory  named
            ``SUN3.X11''  for  binaries  that run on a Sun-3 accessing a
            display running X11.  The _l_i_b_t_e_x_t and _l_i_b_g_r_a_p_h_i_c_s libraries,
            which  are  not dependent on X, only need subdirectories for
            the target machine (e.g., SUN3).  The _s_r_c directory contains
            an executable shell script named ``genmake'' that constructs
            ``Makefile'' for  a  binary  subdirectory  using  a  generic
            makefile  named  ``genMakefile''.  The generic makefile con-
            tains definitions and targets, but no dependencies.  For ex-
            ample,  ``genmake SUN3 X11''  creates  ``SUN3.X11/Makefile''
            with the header file dependencies.  In the top _s_r_c directory
            there  is a makefile to build all the libraries and commands
            from scratch.

            InterViews to
