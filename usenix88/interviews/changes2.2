                 This note briefly describes the changes made to  Inter-
            Views  since  the  2.1  release that went out with the X11R1
            distribution in September.  Most importantly, a large number
            of  problems have been fixed for X11.  InterViews was origi-
            nally written for X10 and ported using a preliminary release
            of  X11.  We are now using X11 regularly and are running In-
            terViews applications on top of it.  We also continue to use
            X10 on some systems.

                 The second important part of this 2.2 release is a  new
            library  of  classes  to manage structured text (called _l_i_b_-
            _t_e_x_t), described in the Text(3I) manual page.   The  library
            also  includes  some  classes for interactive text manipula-
            tion,  including  StringEdit(3I)  and  TextViewer(3I).   The
            _p_a_g_e_s  program  demonstrates  some of the facilities of this
            library.

                 The InterViews  library  contains  three  new  classes.
            Deck(3I)  is  a  subclass of scene that contains interactors
            (conceptually) stacked on top of each other.  A deck is use-
            ful  to  implement ``paging'' through a document, or for al-
            ternate tool pallets or menu entries.  Bitmap(2I) is a prim-
            itive  for manipulating bitmap data.  It can be used to draw
            an  image  created  with  the  X  bitmap  program  onto   an
            interactor's canvas.  ReqErr(2I) is a primitive for catching
            errors from X.

                 The Workstation class has  been  eliminated.   All  its
            functionality is now in the World class.

                 For a variety of reasons, the name of the  base  struc-
            tured  graphics  class  was changed from Picture to Graphic,
            and Picture is now the name of the subclass of Graphic  that
            represents  a  group of objects.  A new class, GraphicBlock,
            can be used to define an interactor that contains structured
            graphics.   The _g_r_a_p_h_i_c_s program demonstrates how to use the
            structured graphics library to define  persistent  graphical
            objects.

                 The scaled  digital  clock  program,  _d_c_l_o_c_k  has  been
            rewritten.   It  previously used an old interface, which was
            not distributed as part of InterViews 2.1.  The  old  inter-
            face  (known as libInterViews1.0) is now only used by _i_d_r_a_w,
            and the source code for it is contained in this distribution
            under  the _i_d_r_a_w source subdirectory.  The _i_s_h_e_l_l command is
            no longer distributed.

                 We are currently working on several applications on top
            of  InterViews,  including  a rewrite of _i_d_r_a_w in C++ (using
            _l_i_b_g_r_a_p_h_i_c), a structure editor, and a  window-oriented  de-
            bugger.   We  are also working on a library for general sup-
            port of drawing systems.
