                 This note briefly describes the changes made to  Inter-
            Views  since  the 2.2 release that became available in early
            January 1988.  A number of the changes  are  bug  fixes  for
            X11, including the Bitmap class (which didn't work at all on
            X11), the painter CopyArea operation,  and  the  font  Index
            operation.

                 Viewport(3I) is a new scene that contains a single com-
            ponent.  Unlike MonoScene(2I), which gives its component ex-
            actly as much space as the monoscene has, a  viewport  allo-
            cates  a component exactly as much space as it wants (deter-
            mined from the shape).  This space will be  clipped  to  the
            viewport  size.  The viewport maintains a perspective to ad-
            just  the  portion  of  the  component  that   is   actually
            displayed.

                 Adjuster(3I) and Panner(3I) are both views  of  a  per-
            spective.   An  adjuster  is  a  button that scrolls a fixed
            amount when pushed.  A panner allows two-dimensional  scrol-
            ling and zooming.

                 The Frame(3I) interface has changed  slightly.   Frames
            now have a sensor that listens for on/off events.  The frame
            constructor therefore no longer takes a sensor as a  parame-
            ter.  Frame::Handle operation calls a virtual Highlight with
            true or false for an on or  off  event.   This  organization
            simplies the implementation of subclasses.  A new frame sub-
            class, BorderFrame, draws the frame  using  a  gray  pattern
            when highlighting is off and a solid pattern when highlight-
            ing is on.

                 The Scene(2I) Change operation has been simplified.  It
            now only takes an interactor; the semantics are that the in-
            teractor is a child of the scene and has changed its  shape.
            A  new Propagate operation can specify whether shape changes
            are propagated up the scene hierarchy.  A new Move operation
            is used to change an interactor's position.

                 Several new operations have been added to the base  in-
            teractor  class.   UnRead  puts  an  event back on the input
            queue as if it  were  never  read.   GetRelative  translates
            coordinates to be relative to another interactor.  The MapX,
            MapY, and Event::GetRelative operations have  been  removed.
            Reshape  is a virtual that requests an interactor modify its
            shape.  GetComponents returns a dynamically-allocated  array
            of interactor pointers for the components within an interac-
            tor.  It is only meaningful for scenes.

                 Three new patterns are  now  defined  by  the  external
            variables  ``lightgray'', ``gray'', and ``darkgray''.  These
            patterns corresponding to filling one-eighth, one-half,  and
            seven-eighths of an area, respectively.

                 Damage(3I) is a new class in _l_i_b_g_r_a_p_h_i_c  that  performs
            minimal  screen  update  after  a  modification is made to a
            structured graphic object.

                 To make InterViews more portable, we have replaced  all
            appearances  of  _c_l_a_s_s._o_p_e_r_a_t_i_o_n  with _c_l_a_s_s::_o_p_e_r_a_t_i_o_n, de-
            clared constants using ``static const'',  and  added  condi-
            tional  compilation  code  for HP/UX (HP's version of Unix).
            We have also changed the makefiles so that they do  not  use
            the VPATH macro.
