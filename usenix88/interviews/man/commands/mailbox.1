.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBmailbox\fP [ options ] [ font=\fIname\fP ] [ mailbox=\fIpath\fP ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fIMailbox\fP is a monitor of incoming mail.  It can indicate the arrival of
new mail in three ways:  by highlighting a ``flag'', by displaying the sender
and subject of new mail in a window, or by sounding the workstation
bell. Any of these may optionally be turned off.

Use font \fIname\fP for the text and flag.

Check the file \fIpath\fP for incoming mail (default is constructed by
appending the user's login name to the path /usr/spool/mail)
.TP

Position the lower left corner at (\fIx\fP,\fIy\fP) relative to the
screen lower left corner (default is to place with the mouse).
