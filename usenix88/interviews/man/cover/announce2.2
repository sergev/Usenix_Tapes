The 2.2 version of InterViews is now ready for distribution.
This version includes numerous fixes for X11 and a library
for handling structured text, along with minor fixes and enhancements.
As I am now running X11 on my (Sun) workstation, I am confident
that the X11 interface is solid.  In addition to the "squares" demo program,
there is a new "graphics" demo program that shows how to use
the structured graphics and persistent classes, and a "pages" program
that demonstrates how to use the structured text library.

You can obtain InterViews 2.2 by one of the following methods:

    (1) Send me a message requesting the source and manual pages
	be sent electronically to ___________ (e-mail address).
	I will send it out as shell archives (there are too many differences
	from what went out on the X11R1 tape to send patches).

    (2) Use anonymous ftp to "lurch.stanford.edu".  The binaries, source, and
	manual pages are in separate compressed tar files in a subdirectory
	called "InterViews2.2".  The binaries are separated by host and
	X version (e.g., SUN3.X10.Z).

    (3) Send a "stamped, self-addressed" tape (Sun, TK50, or 1/2-inch) to

	    Mark Linton
	    CIS 213
	    Stanford University
	    Stanford, CA 94305

	I will send hardcopy of the documentation along with the tape.

    (4) Wait for the C++ distribution tape (coming in March or so, I think)
	or the X11R2 tape (hopefully -- I haven't checked with MIT
	on this yet).

Please send a reply to this message letting me know which method you pick
(or if you no longer want to be on this mailing list).

	Mark
