InterViews supports the design and implementation of user interfaces.
The basic model of InterViews is \fIobject-oriented\fP,
with C++ as the implementation language.
This manual describes InterViews version 2.3,
which runs as library code on top of the X window system
(the library can be compiled to run on either X10 or X11).
If you are not running X already,
you should bring it up before trying to use
the programs and library routines documented here.
The manual also assumes familiarity with C++ (version 1.2).

Section 1 of this manual contains
descriptions of several commands
we have implemented with InterViews, including \fIidraw\fP,
a picture editor with functionality similar to MacDraw,
\fIsquares\fP, a demonstration program
for the InterViews composition classes,
\fIgraphics\fP, a demonstration program
for the structured graphics classes, and
\fIpages\fP, a demonstration program for the structured text classes.
Section 2 contains documentation
for the primitive interactive objects of InterViews.
The primitives are the basis for the library classes
described in Section 3.
The primitives are the only classes that directly call
X library routines.

A number of people have contributed
to the design and implementation of InterViews.
Paul Calder designed the boxes and glue model
of combining interactive objects, wrote many of the commands, and
implemented the structured text library.
John Vlissides wrote
\fIidraw\fP and the structured graphics library.
Both Paul and John have also contributed
to the design and implementation of the primitives.
Craig Dunwoody participated in the design of the primitives.
Paul Hegarty wrote the window manager.
John Interrante helped prepare this manual.
We are grateful to the growing InterViews user community
for their encouragement and support.
