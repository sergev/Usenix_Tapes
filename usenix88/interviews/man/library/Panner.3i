.SH NAME
Panner \- two-dimensional scrolling and zooming of an interactor
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <InterViews/panner.h>
.SH DESCRIPTION
A panner is an interactor that manipulates
the perspective of another interactor to provide two-dimensional scrolling
and zooming.  A panner is composed of a \fIslider\fP and several adjusters, 
including two zoomers and four movers. The slider's position and size reflect
the current origin, size, and aspect ratio in the interactor's perspective.
Dragging the slider around with the mouse
changes the perspective's \fIcurx\fP and \fIcury\fP members.
.SH PUBLIC OPERATIONS
.TP
.B "Panner(Interactor*, int size = 0, Painter* = stdpaint)"
Create a panner for the given interactor, optionally with the given width
and painter.
If the size is 0, a reasonable default size is used.  The panner's aspect
ratio reflects that of the perspective.
The painter will be used to draw the panner and its components.

A slider reflects and lets the user specify the visible portion of the view.
A rectangle represents the visible area, while the area
surrounding it represents the total area.  Clicking and holding down
any mouse button on the rectangle allows you to drag it
to a different position within the total area.
The perspective's current origin is shifted to reflect the new position when
the button is released.  Holding down the shift key while dragging the
rectangle constrains its motion horizontally or vertically.  Clicking outside
the rectangle moves it in the corresponding one of eight
directions; for example, clicking to the right of the rectangle moves it to 
the right.  If the left button is used, the movement increment equals the
perspective's \fIsx\fP or \fIsy\fP member variables.
The middle button increments by \fIlx\fP or \fIly\fP, and the right button
moves the rectangle as far as possible.
The Reshape call sets the width of the slider to that of the
passed Shape and calls Change on
the parent interactor.  Update redisplays the slider to reflect a change
in the interactor's perspective.
