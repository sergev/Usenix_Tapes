``ltextcursor'' (an `I' text cursor with hot spot on the left),
``rtextcursor'' (hot spot on the right),

.SH PUBLIC OPERATIONS
.TP
.B "typedef int CursorPattern[cursorHeight];"
.TP
.B "Cursor(short x, short y, CursorPattern pat, CursorPattern mask, Color* f, Color* b)"
Create a cursor with (\fIx\fP,\ \fIy\fP) as the ``hot spot''
relative to the lower left corner of the cursor image.
Ones in \fIpat\fP specify
which pixels should be displayed in the foreground color \fIf\fP and
zeros specify which pixels should be in the background color \fIb\fP.
Ones in \fImask\fP specify which pixels should be visible.
If a workstation does not support a cursor mask, then
only the foreground pixels are set.
Cursor patterns are interpreted left-to-right (opposite of VAX bit order).
