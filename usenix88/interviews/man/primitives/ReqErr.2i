.TH REQERR 2I "15 June 1987" "InterViews" "InterViews Reference Manual"
.SH NAME
ReqErr \- handle request errors
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <InterViews/reqerr.h>
.SH DESCRIPTION
Some requests to the window server may generate an error.
For example, if a window is destroyed while it is being repositioned
interactively,
the request to place the window in the new position will fail.
Normally, errors cause a process to terminate.
The ReqErr class is used to handle errors within an application.
The base class defines the attributes associated with each error,
including a \fImessage\fP string describing the error,
an integer \fIrequest\fP code that specifies the kind of call that
generated the error, and a \fIid\fP object that was the target
of the request.
When an error occurs, the attributes of the current request handler
are assigned and the handler's Error operation is called.
