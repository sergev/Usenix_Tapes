This is a starter-kit for a collection of library-classes. 

I don't have manual pages for any of them yet.  I would
hope that somebody will be good enough to write some.  If you do that and
send them to me, I will gladly proof-read them and post them to the net.
I don't think you will have any trouble figuring out what they do, though.
Read the comments in the .doc files.  The "demo" programs may also be
useful.

Another worthwhile project would be to write some .h files
for inclusion in regular C programs.  Translate inline function-calls into 
macros, etc.. (Yes, I still maintain some programs written in that archaic 
language.)  Notice that the include-files here are suffixed with .H to 
indicate that they are written in C++, not C.


I would also be interested in hearing your comments about style or quality.
Please send comments by email.

And of course, if there is a bug, I want to know that too. Send me the
email, and I will post corrections to the net.

The Makefile uses some features which Sun added, so if you have an original
"make", it won't work. (Sorry.)  You will need to make your own Makefile, or
just compile the things "by hand".  The Makefile also uses the program
"replace", whose source is included here.  It contains a little bit of
Unix dependant code.
