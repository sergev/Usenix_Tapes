//
// These are classes derived from class Assoc, for indexing with identifiers
// (as defined by various languages).  They are intended for use in compilers
// and such.
//
// The keys need not be null-terminated, so you can just read an entire 
// source file into a buffer, then use pointers into the buffer as keys.
// The redefined virtual functions hash() and equiv() recongize the
// ends of the keys by context.
//
// The virtual functions copy_key() and delete_key() are not redefined.
// The default version does not actually make a copy, it just returns
// the char* it is given.  So the keys must remain untouched so long
// as the lookup table is active.
