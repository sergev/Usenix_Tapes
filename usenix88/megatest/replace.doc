/*
** This program modifies its input file(s).  It replaces all occurances
** of a specified string with a specified new string. If no replacements
** were actually done, the input file is not altered. (Its last-modification-
** date remains the same.)  It prints to stdout the names of the files in which
** replacements are done.  In the unlikely event that the system
** goes down after unlinking the old file but before linking the new one,
** there will be a copy of the new file in <filename>.<pid>, e.g.
** "/foo/bar.15782".
