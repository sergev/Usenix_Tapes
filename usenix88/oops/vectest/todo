Keith,
	We are putting Art Hays up for promotion to
electronics engineer, gs-13.  Would you be willing
to write a letter of recommendation for his promotion?
The letter should emphasize Art's technical skills,
and indicate his value as an expert consultant.
	Please let me know soon whether you will be
willing to write such a letter.  If so, please
address the letter to:

	Dr. Robert H. Wurtz
	Chief, Laboratory of Sensorimotor Research
	Bldg. 10, Rm. 10-C-101
	National Eye Institute, NIH
	Bethesda, MD 20892.

			Thanks,
				Lance
