To make the string type, simply enter the command:

% make

in this directory. This produces a string.o that can be linked into
programs that use the string type. As well, the include file string.h
must be included in any program using the string type. For Vax
machines, a version of the string type can be constructed that makes
use of special block move and compare instructions. This is done by:

% make S=VAX

There is unformatted troff documentation about the operations allowed
on type string in String.t.

There are some example programs, FortFormat.cc and WordCount1 & 2.cc
and test data, FortFormatTest and WordTest, for these programs.  (The
test programs read from cin, so make sure you redirect the test data
into the programs or they just sit there doing nothing.)

There is NO warranty either expressed or implied as to the correctness
of any of these routines nor is there any requirement to fix or
maintain any of these routines. However, if errors are found, the
author would greatly appreciate being informed.
