# lp driver script using 3bnet as a transport.
# January 8 , 1987  Alex Latzko  ( latzko@andromeda.rutgers.edu )
#
# this script assumes there is a printer on the other end for it to
# talk to.  It also assumes the banner page is generated on the
# printer end.  This is a small system and people can keep track of 
# print outs as they come off the printer.
#
# install this with the device set to /dev/console so error messages 
# go to the correct place.
#
# replace medusa with the name of your target machine.
#
# options used on nisend
# -m  suppress mailing results on success
# -s  suppress one line message w/ action
# -a  set mode on receipt
# -u  set owner name on receipt
# -f  put it where I want it
# -d  destination machine
# -!  send the contents of the quoted string to the shell
