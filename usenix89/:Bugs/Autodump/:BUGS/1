Summary: Why have it compete with getty?

I have a similar set of shell scripts (which I like better).  But I had
this same problem with competing with getty.  So I fixed init so it
would keep the console logged in.  (Actually....it was ANY line who's
/etc/ttys entry had 'c' in the first column)  So now It doesn't compete
with getty, any time I need to do something quick, I've got a terminal
already logged in, etc.  (We can only do this here because the machine
is kept locked with limited access.)

Ok, I'll offer a set of diffs to anybody wanting them.  Please note
that this is for 4.2BSD, on a 11/750.

Oh, how do I run the backup program?  Simple.  I wrote a quickie that
would use that ioctl() that forced characters into a terminal's input
buffer.  This one takes the text from the command line.  So my crontab
entry looks like:

     30 04 * * 1 force /dev/console "cd /backup; daily 2"

(The '2' is the dump level to use.)
