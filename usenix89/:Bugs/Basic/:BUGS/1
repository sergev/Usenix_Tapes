Has anyone else had luck bringing up the recently-posted BASIC interpreter
(Phil's BASIC) on a machine other than the four mentioned in the posting?
 
Aa co-worker and I have tried to bring it up on a Perkin-Elmer 3220 running
Edition VII, a Perkin-Elmer 3250 running XELOS (SVr2), and an IBM-PC AT
running SCO XENIX/286. In all three cases, we have had problems related to
the termcap code.

In all three cases, it was necessary to make the interpreter default to no
editor for it to work with most termcap entries.

In the best case, the editor would function correctly with very simple
termcaps (adm3, pe550, etc.).

Under no circumstances, would the editor work with a termcap that referred
to another entry by way of a 'tc=' entry. Depending on the system, either a
'BAD TERMCAP ENTRY' message is returned or the program goes into
never-never land.


Has anyone else noticed problems with the termcap code? If so, what did you
have to do to fix it?

Thanks in advance...
