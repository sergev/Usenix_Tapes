Yes.  It turns out that Phil implemented two routines which hose up System V
machines.  One is setupterm(), which is found in the Sys V terminfo library.
I renamed it to bsetupterm().  The other is strcpy().  This is the one that
really hangs up terminfo.  Phil's  version (which I assume was implemented
before the advent of the standard strings library) has the arguments in the
reverse order, and has a different return value.  Simply rename all references
to bstrcpy() and the problem goes away.
