I brought it up on a TRS-16 running an OLD version of Xenix (1.0.3, I think).
The only change I had to make was to change #include <sys/ioctl.h> to
#include <sgtty.h>.
It seems to run great!

I tried to bring it up on a VAX 750 under 4.2 BSD and have the same
termcap problem but haven't had time to investigate. Any suggestions
would be welcome here!
