Ken references the 'unique' function in his program to get a unique
sequential number:

> 	/*
> 	 *  Spool file name starts with tf, followed by grade, followed by
> 	 *  a unique sequential number.  The files are sorted by this name
> 	 *  for priority of execution.
> 	 */
> 	spoolnumber = unique();
> 	sprintf(tfname, tffmt, SPOOLDIR, queue, grade, spoolnumber);

The source code for unique was not in the original article nor is
it in our library (on a Sun 2-120 running bsd4.2). Does anyone
have the source for unique or a description of what it does?

Mail sent to Ken has been returned by the watmath mailer.
