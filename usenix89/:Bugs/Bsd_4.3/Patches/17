The next four articles posted to comp.bugs.4bsd.ucb-fixes, ARTICLES
#13 through #16, will concern the upcoming DST problem.  They contain:

ARTICLE #13	A minimal fix, hopefully easy to install.  It contains
		fixes for both 4.2 and 4.3 BSD systems.  To install
		this fix, unshar ARTICLE #13 in an empty directory and
		follow the instructions contained in the README file.

ARTICLES #14, #15, #16
		What Berkeley has installed.  To install this fix, create a
		directory containing one other directory; the sub-directory
		should be called "tzone".  Unshar ARTICLES #15 and #16 in
		this sub-directory.  Unshar ARTICLE #14 in the top directory.
		Follow the instructions contained in the README file.

You are reading ARTICLE #15.

If you have any problems getting either package to work,
please contact me.

X@(#)README	3.1
X
XPlease send comments or information to
X	seismo!elsie!tz
Xfor forwarding to folks interested in time zone matters.
X
XBe sure to read the comments in "Makefile" and make any changes
Xneeded to make things right for your system.
X
XThis version of the time zone software uses a new format
X(based on the work of Guy Harris, a.k.a guy@sun.UUCP)
Xfor the time zone information files.  They are now stored by default in a
Xdirectory named "/etc/zoneinfo" rather than "/etc/tzdir" or "/etc/timezones"
Xas before.  If you've already compiled programs with older time zone software,
Xjust leave the "/etc/tzdir" and/or "/etc/timezones" files around until you
Xhave a chance to recompile.
X
XFor better compatability with other versions of time conversion functions,
Xthe time zone abbreviation to be used with localtime's return value is now
Xpointed to by one of the two elements of the (char *) array tzname, rather
Xthan by the (char *) tz_abbr.  If you have code that uses tz_abbr, add a
X	-DTZA_COMPAT
Xto the end of the
X	CFLAGS=
Xline in "Makefile".
X
XTo use the new functions, use a "-lz" option when compiling or linking.
X
XHistorical local time information has been included here not because it
Xis particularly useful, but rather to:
X
X*	give an idea of the variety of local time rules that have
X	existed in the past and thus an idea of the variety that may be
X	expected in the future;
X
X*	provide a test of the generality of the local time rule description
X	system.
X
XThe information in the time zone data files is by no means authoritative;
Xif you know that the rules are different from those in a file, by all means
Xfeel free to change file (and please send the changed version to seismo!elsie!tz
Xfor use in the future).  Europeans take note!

X@(#)Theory	3.1
X
XThese time and date functions are much like the System V Release 2.0 (SVR2)
Xtime and date functions; there are a few additions and changes to extend
Xthe usefulness of the SVR2 functions:
X
X*	In SVR2, time display in a process is controlled by the environment
X	variable TZ, which "must be a three-letter time zone name, followed
X	by a number representing the difference between local time and
X	Greenwich Mean Time in hours, followed by an optional three-letter
X	name for a daylight time zone;" when the optional daylight time zone is
X	present, "standard U.S.A. Daylight Savings Time conversion is applied."
X	This means that SVR2 can't deal with other (for example, Australian) 
X	daylight savings time rules, or situations where more than two
X	time zone abbreviations are used in an area.
X
X*	In SVR2, time conversion information is compiled into each program
X	that does time conversion.  This means that when time conversion
X	rules change (as in the United States in 1987), all programs that
X	do time conversion must be recompiled to ensure proper results.
X
X*	In SVR2, time conversion fails for near-minimum or near-maximum
X	time_t values when doing conversions for places that don't use GMT.
X
X*	In SVR2, there's no tamper-proof way for a process to learn the
X	system's best idea of local wall clock.  (This is important for 
X	applications that an administrator wants used only at certain times--
X	without regard to whether the user has fiddled the "TZ" environment
X	variable.  While an administrator can "do everything in GMT" to get
X	around the problem, doing so is inconvenient and precludes handling
X	daylight savings time shifts--as might be required to limit phone
X	calls to off-peak hours.)
X
XThese are the changes that have been made to the SVR2 functions:
X
X*	The "TZ" environment variable is used in generating the name of a file
X	from which time zone information is read; "TZ" is no longer constrained
X	to be a three-letter time zone name followed by a number of hours and
X	an optional three-letter daylight time zone name.  The daylight saving
X	time rules to be used for a particular time zone are encoded in the
X	time zone file; the format of the file allows U.S., Australian, and
X	other rules to be encoded, and allows for situations where more than
X	two time zone abbreviations are used.
X
X	It was recognized that allowing the "TZ" environment variable to
X	take on values such as "US/Eastern" might cause "old" programs
X	(that expect "TZ" to have a certain form) to operate incorrectly;
X	consideration was given to using some other environment variable
X	(for example, "TIMEZONE") to hold the string used to generate the
X	time zone information file name.  In the end, however, it was decided
X	to continue using "TZ":  it is widely used for time zone purposes;
X	separately maintaining both "TZ" and "TIMEZONE" seemed a nuisance;
X	and systems where "new" forms of "TZ" might cause problems can simply
X	give time zone files names such as "EST5EDT" which can be used both by
X	"new" programs (as file names) and "old" programs (as zone names and
X	offsets).
X
X*	To handle places where more than two time zone abbreviations are used,
X	the functions "localtime" and "gmtime" set tzname[tmp->tm_isdst]
X	(where "tmp" is the value the function returns) to the time zone
X	abbreviation to be used.  This differs from SVR2, where the elements
X	of tzname are only changed as a result of calls to tzset.
X
X*	Since the "TZ" environment variable can now be used to control time
X	conversion, the "daylight" and "timezone" variables are no longer
X	needed or supported.  (You can use a compile-time option to cause
X	these variables to be defined and to be set by "tzset"; however, their
X	values will not be used by "localtime.")
X
X*	The "localtime" function has been set up to deliver correct results
X	for near-minimum or near-maximum time_t values.  (A comment in the
X	source code tells how to get compatibly wrong results).
X
X*	A function "tzsetwall" has been added to arrange for the system's
X	best approximation to local wall clock time to be delivered by
X	subsequent calls to "localtime."  Source code for portable
X	applications that "must" run on local wall clock time should call
X	"tzsetwall();" if such code is moved to "old" systems that don't provide
X	tzsetwall, you won't be able to generate an executable program.
X	(These time zone functions also arrange for local wall clock time to be
X	used if tzset is called--directly or indirectly--and there's no "TZ"
X	environment variable; portable applications should not, however, rely
X	on this behavior since it's not the way SVR2 systems behave.)
X
XPoints of interest to folks with Version 7 or BSD systems:
X
X*	The BSD "timezone" function is not present in this package;
X	it's impossible to reliably map timezone's arguments (a "minutes west
X	of GMT" value and a "daylight saving time in effect" flag) to a
X	time zone abbreviation, and we refuse to guess. 
X	Programs that in the past used the timezone function may now examine
X	tzname[localtime(&clock)->tm_isdst] to learn the correct time
X	zone abbreviation to use.  Alternatively, use localtime(&clock)->tm_zone
X	if this has been enabled.
X
X*	The BSD gettimeofday function is not used in this package;
X	this lets users control the time zone used in doing time conversions.
X	Users who don't try to control things (that is, users who do not set
X	the environment variable TZ) get the time conversion specified in the
X	file "/etc/zoneinfo/localtime"; see the time zone compiler writeup for
X	information on how to initialize this file.
X
X*	The BSD "dysize" function is only included if the preprocessor symbol
X	BSD_COMPAT is defined.  For a year y, the BSD code returns the value
X	   ((y % 4) == 0) : 366 : 365
X	while this code returns the value
X	   (((y) % 4) == 0 && ((y) % 100) != 0 || ((y) % 400) == 0) ? 366 : 365
X	There's a comment in the code telling how to get the BSD value.
X
XThe functions that are conditionally compiled if STD_INSPIRED is defined should,
Xat this point, be looked on primarily as food for thought.  They are not in
Xany sense "standard compatible"--some are not, in fact, specified in *any*
Xstandard.  They do, however, represent responses of various authors to
Xstandardization proposals.
X
XOther time conversion proposals, in particular the one developed by folks at
XHewlett Packard, offer a wider selection of functions that provide capabilities
Xbeyond those provided here.  The absence of such functions from this package
Xis not meant to discourage the development, standardization, or use of such
Xfunctions.  Rather, their absence reflects the decision to make this package
Xclose to SVR2 (with the exceptions outlined above) to ensure its broad
Xacceptability.  If more powerful time conversion functions can be standardized,
Xso much the better.
X
XIt's probably not wise to standardize everything in this package.
XWhile the command
X	nroff -man newctime.3
Xproduces a document that describes this package, the command
X	nroff -man -rX3J11 newctime.3
Xproduces a document that describes the "standardizable" parts.

X# ...
X# 
X# ...the European time rules are...standardized since 1981, when
X# most European counrties started DST.  Before that year, only
X# a few countries (UK, France, Italy) had DST, each according
X# to own national rules.  In 1981, however, DST started on
X# 'Apr firstSun', and not on 'Mar lastSun' as in the following
X# years...
X# But also since 1981 there are some more national exceptions 
X# than listed in 'europe': Switzerland, for example, joined DST 
X# one year later, Denmark ended DST on 'Oct 1' instead of 'Sep 
X# lastSun' in 1981---I don't know how they handle now.
X# 
X# Finally, DST ist always from 'Apr 1' to 'Oct 1' in the
X# Soviet Union (as far as I know).

X# ...
X# Subject: timezones
X# ...
X# 
X# The information from Tom Hofmann is (as far as I know) not entirely correct.
X# After a request from chongo at amdahl I tried to retrieve all information
X# about DST in Europe.  I was able to find all from about 1969.
X# 
X# ...standardization
X# on DST in Europe started in about 1977 with switches on first Sunday in
X# April and last Sunday in September.  In UK it was from last but 1 Sunday
X# in march to last Sunday in October.  In 1981 UK joined Europe insofar that
X# the starting day for both shifted to last Sunday in March.  And from 1982
X# the whole of Europe used DST, with switch dates April 1 and October 1 in
X# the Sovjet Union.  In 1985 the SU reverted to standard Europen switch
X# dates.  Note that currently in the UK the switch back date appears not
X# to be the last Sunday in October, but 4 weeks after the last Sunday in
X# September (withness 1982 and 1983 with terminating days October 24 and 23).
X# 
X# It should also be remembered that time-zones are not constants; e.g.
X# Portugal switched in 1976 from MET (or CET) to WET with DST, and the UK
X# used MET throughout from 1967 to 1969, and WET with DST before and after
X# that time.  Note also that though there were rules for switch dates not
X# all countries abided to these dates, and many individual deviations
X# occurred, though not since 1982 I believe.  Another note: it is always
X# assumed that DST is 1 hour ahead of normal time, this need not be the
X# case; at least in the Netherlands there have been times when DST was 2 hours
X# in advance of normal time.

X
X# Note also this from seismo!munnari!kre:
X# "I recall also being told by someone once that Canada didn't have
X# the DST variations in 74/75 that the US did, but I am not nearly

X# The above has been confirmed by Bob Devine; we'll go with it here.
X
X# Before the Uniform Time Act of 1966 took effect in 1967, observance of
X# Daylight Saving Time in the US was by local option, except during wartime.
