The following letter will soon be received by the technical
contact at each 4.3BSD licensed site.  It concerns a number
of fixes that have been applied to 4.3BSD.  The fixes it
refers to have also been posted to this newsgroup.

Dear Colleague,


     A revised version of the 4.3BSD distribution  has  com-
menced  with  shipment  number 0551. This note describes the
revisions that were made so that  sites  that  received  the
earlier version can apply them to their release.

     Eight  bugs  in  the  kernel   networking   code   were
corrected.  A  brief  description  of  the problem that they
correct and a context diff of the fix is  attached  to  this
memo.  On the new tape, the system sources have been updated
according to these reports and the kernel  has  been  recom-
piled and installed on both the mini-root and root file sys-
tems.

     Two routines in the C library have been fixed. A  brief
description  of  the problem that they correct and a context
diff of the fix is attached to this memo. On the  new  tape,
/lib/libc.a  and  /usr/lib/libc_p.a have had these two files
updated. The affected binaries (/bin/passwd, (and  its  hard
links /bin/chsh and /bin/chfn), /etc/ftpd, /usr/ucb/netstat,
and /usr/ucb/systat) have been reloaded and installed.

     The     source     for      the      uucp      document
(/usr/doc/smm/09.uucpimpl/implement.ms)  has  been  replaced
with the rewritten version by Carl S. Gutekunst that appears
in  the  Usenix  documentation  and in documentation shipped
with the revised tapes.  The  diffs  are  too  extensive  to
include  in  this  memo,  but  can  be obtained from CSRG if
needed.

     The source for the gprof document (/usr/doc/misc/gprof)
has  added  the  `pic'  sources used to typeset the document
shipped with the distribution.  The files are too  extensive
to  include  in  this memo, but can be obtained from CSRG if
needed.

     The Regents copyright notices have  been  removed  from
the following files to which they were incorrectly added:

    /usr/doc/smm/10.newsop/tmac.n
    /usr/src/usr.lib/libmp/gcd.c
    /usr/src/usr.lib/libmp/madd.c
    /usr/src/usr.lib/libmp/mdiv.c
    /usr/src/usr.lib/libmp/mout.c
    /usr/src/usr.lib/libmp/msqrt.c
    /usr/src/usr.lib/libmp/mult.c
    /usr/src/usr.lib/libmp/pow.c
    /usr/src/usr.lib/libmp/util.c


     The  C  library  tags  file  (/usr/lib/tags)  has   had
incorrect  lines (starting with ``defined'') removed and the
resulting file has been sorted so that it will be in a  for-
mat that will work with ``vi''.


                    Sincerly,

                    Marshall Kirk McKusick
