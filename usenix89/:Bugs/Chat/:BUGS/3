*** REPLACE THIS LINE WITH YOUR BUG ***

Here is a quick fix for an annoying problem a friend and I found:

In module send.c, the declaration of 'shrtname' is inadequate.
It tends to scribble onto fname[].  Seems the strcpy() blows
away past shrtname[4].  Making shrtname be shrtname[6] seems to
fix the problem.

Remember, strcpy ALWAYS copies the '\0', so the
	strcpy(shrtname, &(shrtname[3]));
probably copies 3 bytes 99% of the time.  I do not think anyone
has 4 character ttynames anymore, so if shrtname originally is "tty01"
(Keep in mind, it is not necessarily '\0' terminated!), then
the strcpy() will muck it up to shrtname[5] (at least, depending on
where a '\0' happens to be AFTER shrtname[4]!)
