Apologies if this has been around before...

We're running C-Kermit Prerelease version #2 dated 5 Mar 85 made
with 'sys3'.  Running as a server using literal filenames, a 'get'
for any file fails saying the file can't be opened.  The problem
seems to be in the sfile() routine...

if (fncnv) {
   .
   .
   .
} else {
   if (*cmarg2 != '\0')
      strcpy(pktnam, cmarg2);
   else strcpy(filnam, pktnam);
}

The last strcpy() has its args reversed, nulling out filnam and producing
the error.  It should read strcpy(pktnam, filnam) instead.
I'm not sure how to report this bug to the powers that be at Columbia,
so if some kind soul would forward this (only if it's a new bug)...
