As posted, the new 'echo' program has several bugs all
stemming from missing 'break' statements in the loop which
parses the arguments. The only visible bug, however, is
that the '-n' option will also select the '-q' option and
nothing will be printed.

Also, the '-q' option should cause the '-n' option to be
selected by default. This allows the program to be used to
create an empty file, as in:

	echo -q foo >newfile

The following diff shows the corrections which will take
care of both problems:

16,18c16,18
< 				case 'n': nflg++;
< 				case 'q': qflg++;
< 				case 'r': rflg++;
---
> 				case 'n': nflg++; break;
> 				case 'q': qflg++; nflg++; break;
> 				case 'r': rflg++; break;
