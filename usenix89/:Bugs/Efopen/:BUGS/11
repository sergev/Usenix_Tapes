	I hate to disagree but, not only does VAX/VMS C V2 support (void) but
DEC also has a little program call MMS (Module Management System) which is
a 'make' for VMS systems, it does all that 'make' does and a little more so
COPTS="/DEFINE=(void=int)" would work IF IT WAS NEEDED!.

	Now...MY pet hate is all these so called compilers that don't seem to
understand the concept of scoping. Time and again I have found programs on
the net falling down because of bad scoping, a thing which VAX/VMS C is good
at!

	Remember, those curly little brackets mean the end of the scope of any
variables declared within them (unless declared otherwise!).

Roll on ANSI Standards...
