Please folks, think about the program before flaming!

This program (as I understand it) is:

	1. Specific to a particular machine (IBM-PC).
	2. Not a complete distribution (it's a "missing function").
	3. Written for a non-UNIX compiler (Lattice or something).
	4. Written for a compiler without (void) type.

So who cares if you can't compile it on UNIX. It's just there to cover up
a crummy runtime library anyway!
