	There is a bug in the English to Phoneme translation I posted
	last week:

		In the routine leftmatch() there is a loop that looks
		like this:

			for ( ; pat != pattern ; pat--)

		This loop terminates early and should be changed to:
	
			int cnt;	/* Number of characters in pattern */
			.
			.
			.
			for (cnt = strlen(pattern) ; cnt > 0 ; pat--,cnt--)

	I do not recommend fixing this by changing the != to >= because
	the variables are pointers and relational operations on pointers
	are not very portable.

	The file containing this bug also needs definitions of TRUE and
	FALSE:

		#define FALSE 0
		#define TRUE (!FALSE)

	These seem to be pre-defined in VAX VMS 'C' under which the
	code was developed.
