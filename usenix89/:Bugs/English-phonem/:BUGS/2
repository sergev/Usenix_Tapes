*** REPLACE THIS LINE WITH YOUR MASSAGE ***

DESCRIPTION:
The recent english to phonetic translator has a bug in the left rule matcher
that causes it to ignore the last character of the left rule.

REPEAT BY:
Compile the code.  Give it the word "llama".  If it returns "AEmAX", you
have the bug; if it returns "lAEmAX", you don't.

FIX: 
Change the for loop in the routine "leftmatch" in the file phoneme.c from:

	for (; pat != pattern; pat--)

to

	for (; pat >= pattern; pat--)	/* PWP - BUG, was "pat != pattern" */
