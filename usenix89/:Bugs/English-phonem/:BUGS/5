Using '#define TRUE (!FALSE)' (or vice versa) like this causes a huge number
of lint complaints about "constant used in conditional context".  This
makes it difficult to use lint.  If one is going so far as to make the
assumption that 0 == FALSE, why not take the (relatively tiny) extra
step and assume that 1 == TRUE?
