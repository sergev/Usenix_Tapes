	For people without bzero() as a standard
	library function create a file bzero.c
	and use the following code:

/* Written by Craig Miller	Anheuser-Busch, Inc. */
bzero(block, siz)
register char *block;
register unsigned siz;
{
	while (siz-- > 0)
		*block++ = 0;
}

	Then add bzero.o to the appropriate lines in the Makefile.

	By the way, this program is neat!
