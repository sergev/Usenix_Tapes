It seems that another bug was found in the halley program posted
a couple of weeks ago.  I wish to thank David Bryant for bringing
it to my attention, and for supplying the fix at the same time.

In the section: "ECLIPTIC COORDINATES", the 8th line down:
   IS       :   Q2 = (Q3 * 180) / PI + P1;
   SHOULD BE:   Q2 = (Q3 * 180) / PI + J + 180;

Sorry for the inconvenience....

Clear Skies,
