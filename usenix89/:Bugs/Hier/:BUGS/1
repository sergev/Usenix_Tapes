[REPOSTING]

UserFunc is the name of a parameter to two routines in sftw.c.
It is of type "address of a function returning an int".  It is
called twice and in each case the indirection operator is missing.

That is, the calls to
	... = UserFunc( ... )
should be
	... = (*UserFunc) ( ... )

This generated compiler-time errors using the MS-C 4.00 compiler.
