Well, lets call it a pseudo-bug. I had the SAME problem when
I bought Lattice 2.14 (they did NOT send me the 2.14 update
stuff! :-( ). The deal is that you have to link NOT ONLY
LC?.LIB, but *also* LCM?.LIB [the M means Math -- it holds
reals (your problem) as well as tan stuff, etc.].

Hope this helps... --Erik

	   It takes thought to make a program that thinks.
	   But it takes work to make a program that works.
