I was getting bus errors in malloc() when I ran "findpaths" (only sometimes).
I traced the bug down to this line:

	newftp->name = malloc(sizeof(file)+1);

This is WRONG, since file is declared as a (char *), it always allocates 3
bytes, instead of enough space to hold the string for the subsequent strcpy.
Change the "sizeof" to "strlen", and findpaths works great.
