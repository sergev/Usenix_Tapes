Recently, more by accident than anything else, I happened upon the following
bit of code in the file DM_NAME.C from MIT's public domain network software
for the IBM PC and clones:

               if(ret_val == 1)
                      ins_dot == FALSE;

This code occurs around line 217 of the file.  I'm not sure what various
compilers would do with this statement, but my hunch is that it's not what
the author intended (there should only be one equal sign in front of FALSE).
The code says it was written during the summer of 1985 by John Romkey
MIT-LCS-DCS.  I don't know how to reach him, so perhaps someone from MIT
who's reading this could pass the info along to the appropriate bodies.
Thanks.
