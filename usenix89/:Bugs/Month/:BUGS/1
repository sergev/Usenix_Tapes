Is there anyone out there besides myself that gets a core dump
from the "month" program posted a while back?

Apparently, after starting up the daemon it periodically checks
to see if you are still logged on.  If not it, it calls the function
terminate().  Terminate attempts to do some final screen manipulation
before exiting; well this causes the program to dump.  I changed
the call from terminate() to exit(0).  So far works like a trooper.

I attempted to contact the author about this but I received no reply.
Could someone please verify this, since I am not a great C hack.
