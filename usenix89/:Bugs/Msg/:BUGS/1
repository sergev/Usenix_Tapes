The posted mail program "msg" contains several sever security bugs. If
it is executed with setuid root permission, you can modify any files
(like /etc/passwd) and read all files in the system.

1. Create file "apa" which lists: "newname::0:3::/:".

2. Start "msg".

3. Change mailbox to "apa".

4. Read file (press return and ignore error messages).

5. Save to /etc/passwd.

6. Exit "msg" and login as newname (which is equivalent to root).

Proposed solution:
    Remove setuid flag.

Msg also frequently dereference null pointers (when setting up the
environment).

Proposed solution:
    I will send diffs on demand.
