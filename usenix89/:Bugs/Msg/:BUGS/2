	I've received this problem report and fixed it in my program.
I'll be posting a new (improved) (of course :-) version to mod.sources
around the end of this month.

 In the meantime, the solution is to add code of the form

	if (! can_access(filename, "a")) {
	  error1("Permission to append to file %s denied!", filename);
   	  return;
	}

 to the file "file.c" in the save routine just before it actually does the 
 fopen call...

Needless to say, I regret not finding this first - I guess I'll have to 
work on being more devious ...

			Stay tuned...
