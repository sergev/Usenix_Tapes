To the kind author/supplier of 'nag' (sorry I have lost your name/address).

PROBLEM:
The ':' mark in the following nag-file seems not to get cleared sometimes.

CAUSE:
As far as I can tell it happens after you run 'okok' to silence
a daily entry and then logout before the event time:
next morning I login again before the event time,
so the entry looks still okok'ed.
However it has also happened after I logged in again much later that afternoon.

SOLUTION:
This appears to be a design problem, not a code problem,
so I don't offer a patch.
