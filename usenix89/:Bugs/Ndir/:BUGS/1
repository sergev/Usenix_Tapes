We spent a very nice evening tracking down a problem which turned out to
be due to a line in ndir.h which said:

	#define void

Needless to say, this does bad things to lines like:

	(void) sprintf(sbuf, "Bletch");

The "#define void" line was not present in several versions of the ndir
code which I have seen, but it happened to be in the copy of ndir.h which
I installed in /usr/include.

We deleted the line, as our compiler understands the void type.
