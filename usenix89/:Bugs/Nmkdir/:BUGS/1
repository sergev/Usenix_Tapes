Summary: Handling of "nmkdir a/b/c a/b/d" changes

In article <1090@noscvax.UUCP>, broman@noscvax.UUCP (Vincent P. Broman) writes:

Note that the script that followed in the referenced article handles a command
such as
	nmkdir a/b/c a/b/d
differently than do the programs it sought to emulate:
	Script started on Mon Sep  2 16:36:30 1985
	Warning: no access to tty; thus no job control in this shell...
	% cd /tmp
	% rm -f -r a
	% nmkdir.sh a/b/c a/b/d
	% rm -f -r a
	% nmkdir.csh a/b/c a/b/d
	mkdir: cannot make directory a
	mkdir: cannot make directory a/b
	% 
	script done on Mon Sep  2 16:37:08 1985

And I suppose I'm obliged to reveal my entry in the contest (with no warranty
as to suitability for any purpose whatsoever).  The "set x" and "shift" nonsense
gets around the odd handling of "$@" by sh when $# is zero:
	for i
	do
		case "$i" in
			/*)	tonow=/ ;;
			*)	tonow= ;;
		esac
		set x
		IFS=/
		for j in $i
		do
			IFS=" "
			tonow="$tonow$j"
			test -d "$tonow" || set "$@" "$tonow"
			tonow="$tonow/"
		done
		IFS=" "
		case $# in
			1)	;;
			*)	shift ; /bin/mkdir "$@" || exit $?
		esac
	done
