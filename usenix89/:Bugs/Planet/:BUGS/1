Summary: minor bug in planet2.c


There is a minor bug in Fred Mendenhall's planet2.c program.
It treats the 24-hour time as though 1250 was 12.5 hours instead
of 12 + 50/60.

The following correction to the day calculation fixes it:

    int hour,day;

    ...

    hour   = (int)(time/100);
    minute = time - hour*100;
    day    = (double)dd + ((double)(hour+tz+minute/60.0))/24.0;

This makes example 3.a in Meeus's book (page 24) come out right, and
changes the ultimate locations of the planets by a small amount.
