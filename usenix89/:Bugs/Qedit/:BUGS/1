has anybody been able to create the qedit.arc successfully?
when i combine the three parts and attempt to uudecode, i
get a "no end line" error message.  if i try to put an
end line in and retry the uudecode, i get a "short file"
error.  am i doing something wrong or should the archive
be reposted?
