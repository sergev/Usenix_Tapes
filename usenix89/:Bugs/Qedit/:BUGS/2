I too had problems along the lines you reported.  Just by accident
I noticed the first few lines of parts 2 and 3 looked similar.  On
further checking I found they are identical (except for the headers
of course).  As far as I can tell, parts 1 and 2 are OK.  The author
accidentally transmitted part 2 again as part 3.  I've sent him mail
to this affect and asked him to post the real part 3.  Hopefully it
or this article will reach him.
