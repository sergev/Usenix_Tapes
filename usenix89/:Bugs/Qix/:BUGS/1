The sockets are for socketpair() and that is used in replacement of
pipe(2) because (from the manual entry)

"Pipes are really a special case of the socketpair(2) call and, in fact,
are implemented as such in the system."

You can use pipes and remove the sockets if you like.  However, the
main function of the program is the select(2) call which I didn't think
existed on sys v systems.  I was under the impression that it was a
4.2ism.  If you have select(), then changing the sockets to pipes should
be all that's necessary.

Sorry for not mentioning this in my original posting...
