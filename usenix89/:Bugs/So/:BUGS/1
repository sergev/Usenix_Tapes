Since Bellcore has 4.2 one at least one of one of their machines, just copy
the source over to your S5 machine and compile it.  It's a simple program
(written by the VP of R&D at Sun Microsystems) which should run on any V7 or
post-V7 version of UNIX.  (According to the comments at the front:

	This program eliminates .so's from a n/troff input stream.
	It can be used to prepare safe input for submission to the
	phototypesetter since the software supporting the operator
	doesn't let him do chdir.

	This is a kludge and the operator should be given the
	ability to do chdir.

	This program is more generally useful, it turns out, because
	the program tbl doesn't understand ".so" directives.
)

I don't know what the U of C's policy on redistributing their software is,
but I don't think "soelim" has any AT&T code in it so there's probably no
problem with AT&T.
