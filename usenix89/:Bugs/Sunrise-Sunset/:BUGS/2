	Has anyone else had trouble with Robert Bond's sunrise/sunset
calculation program? I compiled it on my Xenix-286 system, changed

<sys/time.h> to <time.h> as he suggested, changed the default timezone,
latitude and longitude to that of my site, and ran it.

	Instead of giving me an hour and minute for sunrise and sunset,
it gave me something like:

	Sunrise -18032: -53
	Sunset  -18056: -8

	Has this happened to anyone else? Is it what's supposed to
happen???? The other options seem to work ok, giving real numbers anyway...
