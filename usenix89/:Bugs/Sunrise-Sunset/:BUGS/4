Apparently I misinterpreted my almanac. I pickup the times for 20 degrees north
of Greenwich (I think).
I tried again.
My newspaper claims that on Friday 5/31/85 the sun rises (rose) at 05:30
and sets (set) at 20:21.
I said:		sun -z 5 -a 40.733 -o 74.1667
It said:	Sunrise:  4:25    Sunset:  19:21        
Which I guess is correct!! (close enough) (since we are on daylight
savings time, add an hour)
Where did the 5 minutes for sunrise go??
How do I get the program to realize it's EDT and not EST?
