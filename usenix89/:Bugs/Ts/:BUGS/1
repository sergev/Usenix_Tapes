There is a minor problem in the version of ts.c that went around recently
(the program which looks at a tape and reports blocking information for
a fixed record length / fixed block length tape.  If the last block of a
file is short, it reports the number of bytes correctly, however, for
the previous blocks that are full, it also reports the short number of
bytes.  The fix is:

96c96
< 				    nrec, recno-1, recno - nrec, fsize);
---
> 				    nrec, recno-1, recno - nrec, n);
