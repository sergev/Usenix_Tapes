The referenced article stated the System V times call returned the CPU time.

I haven't looked at the code, but I quote from the times(2) manual page:

"Upon successful completion, *times* returns the elaspsed real time, in HZ,
since an arbitrary time in the past (e.g. system start-up time).
This point does not change from one invocation of *times* to another."

Thus I think one can use times(2) to fake a suitable ftime unless the manual
page is in error.
