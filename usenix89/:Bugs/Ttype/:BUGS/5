Please DONT!!!!!

If your system does not have timeb.h, then it also doesn't have ftime(),
the function that uses the type "struct timeb".  If you don't have this
function, then you need a total rewrite of the program (if that is even
possible)!  ftime returns time in units SMALLER than one second.  System III/V
do not support this functionality (a major flaw, in my opinion) making
timing tasks such as in ttype much more difficult.
