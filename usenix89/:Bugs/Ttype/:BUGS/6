I received several responses to my (misguided) request for timeb.h,
including explanations of why it wouldn't do me any good.  It turned out
that the patches needed to make the program run on our SysV system
weren't very extensive, far from a "total rewrite".  Of course, the
calculated typing speeds are probably grossly inaccurate since the
program now has only 1 second timing resolution, but I was more
interested in a tool for practice than in precise evaluation of my
skill, anyway.

Many thanks to everyone who responded.
