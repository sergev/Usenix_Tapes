Summary: use times(2) to get < 1 sec on Sys III/V

< If your system does not have timeb.h, then it also doesn't have ftime(),
< the function that uses the type "struct timeb".  If you don't have this
< function, then you need a total rewrite of the program (if that is even
< possible)!  ftime returns time in units SMALLER than one second.  System
< III/V do not support this functionality (a major flaw, in my opinion) making
< timing tasks such as in ttype much more difficult.

To get < 1 second timing information on System III/V, one can make use of
the times(2) system call. In addition to filling in a structure with
information that is not needed for this purpose, it returns the elapsed real
time, in 60ths or 100ths of a second depending on the processor, since an
arbitrary (fixed per process) point in the past.

By using this system call, I have been able to get the functionality needed
for programs such as ttype.

I'm not going to debate flawness issue.
