A severe bug in the code of address.c and a possible bug (only seen on
some systems) in getpath.c have been reported by users so far. Also
another user has submitted a speedup for getpath.c.

The DIFFS to install these fixes/enhancements has been submitted to
mod.sources. If you need them and can not get them from mod.souces,
drop me a letter and I will mail them to you.
