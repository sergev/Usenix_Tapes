I added two subroutines to vi 3.7 as supplied with 2.9bsd which are
called from ex_vops2.c to set a standout mode flag 'I' in the lower
left corner of the screen during inserts of text; it seems to make
use of vi easier for the beginner, to distinuish the insert modes from
command mode.  Seeing the flag go on and off is reassuring.  The
subroutines are assemblages of other vi subroutine calls which do the
job.  My effort is hereby deeded to public domain, all AT&T
Bell Laboratory and UCB rights not disputed.

BUGS: not tested with ex.40 version.  I added "jpnsubs.o" to
the same overlay segment of ex.70 in which ex_vops2.o lives.
They could probably just as well be tacked onto the end of ex_vops2.c.

This is not a shar file.  "Patch" will not handle the subroutines
as a separate file.
