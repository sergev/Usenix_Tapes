Ok. I've had time to look at the problem.  If your VIDEX Videoterm
gets sea-sick while booting DCOM, forget about the other patches I
posted and use this one.  It has taken quite a bit of research to
arrive at this patch.

Here we go:

1) Put your DCOM 3.3 disk in drive one after DOS 3.3 has booted.
2) Type: (at the ']' prompt)

BLOAD DCOM.SCREEN.VDX,A$5000
CALL -151
505B: 7B 50 5C 29 1B 08 18 1A 00 08 E0 08 00 00 00 00
3D0G
BSAVE DCOM.SCREEN.VDX,A$5000,L2200

3) Boot the disk.

Notes:  Be sure to check the numbers over before you hit return.  
	Make SURE you have a backup copy of DCOM before changing
	anything.  ALSO: IF YOU DON'T READ ANYTHING ELSE, READ THIS:
	DO NOT, I REPEAT, DO NOT apply previous VIDEX patches to
	this disk.  This patch fixes once and for all the wavey
	screen problem.  DO NOT apply last month's patches to the
	BASIC HELLO program if you use the above patch.

What the patch does:

The VIDEX Videoterm has a very picky Motorola 6845 CRT Controller and
the initialization values I obtained for it were from Motorola, not
VIDEX.  Lo and behold, the Videx card cannot use the default timings,
so it needs different values... This patch replaces the
16 bad parameters with the parameters Videx uses...

The VIDEX card has always been a sore point for DCOM.  It requires
such pampering!  Doesn't surprise me a bit that Andy Hertzfeld wrote
the orignal ROM code for the beast.

Anyway, if there are any problems with this patch, PLEASE let me
know as I've got to mail out a couple of disks and would really like
to hear if it causes any problems.

Thanks for putting up with the hassle,

P.S.   I'm looking into the arrow key problem.  I suspect it has
	something to do with the keyboard driver and the new printing
	routines.  As usual, keep your ears open...
