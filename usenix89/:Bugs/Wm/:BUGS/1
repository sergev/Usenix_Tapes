It bombs out in newwin(), I think while trying a calloc().  This happens
whether you compile it with -DFAST or not.  If you run it with the "-"
option, it tries to get you to create some windows, but the cursor won't
move.  When you hit "x" it can't create a shell cause the window is zero
size.

I accidentally sent this reply first to the moderator of the group.  Oops!
Perhaps postnews should verify with the user first before automatically
mailing something instead of posting.
