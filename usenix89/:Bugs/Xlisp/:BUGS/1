Sorry, but I can't find uses of 'oldnewenv' as a NODE and not a NODE *. 
(Or does it mean 'change all '*oldnewenv' into 'oldnewenv'?)
Can somebody who figured this out please post a diff or something 
we can use to apply the fix?  We have version 1.4, which I assume is
the current one.

Thanks,
Cesar
