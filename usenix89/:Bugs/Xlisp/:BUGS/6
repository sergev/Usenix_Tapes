A rather serious bug in XLISP causes it to get scrambled if a garbage
collection occurs at the wrong time.  The following fix, provided by
the author, cures the problem.

Try making the following changes to XLEVAL,XLCONT,XLOBJ in every place where
the variable 'oldnewenv' is mentioned:

	/* note that this is a 'NODE' not a 'NODE *' */
	NODE ... ,oldnewenv, ...;

	.
	.
	.

	oldstk = xlsave( ... ,&oldnewenv, ... ,NULL);

	.
	.
	.

	oldnewenv.n_ptr = xlnewenv;

	.
	.
	.

	xlnewenv = oldnewenv.n_ptr;

I did this change on the version of XLISP that I am running on a VAX-11/750
under VMS version 4.1 and it seems to have fixed the problem that you were
refering to.

	Sorry about this problem,
	David Betz

-------
Note -- there is at least one place where the call to xlsave comes
AFTER the saving of xlnewenv.  You must reverse this order, as xlsave
will wipe out the pointer.
