The following file is the 8/14/86 DHRYSTONE 1.1 benchmark results
in Venturcom's "Prelude" database format.  This format can be
manipulated on UNIX systems which have the Prelude database
manager, or it can easily be manipulated by "awk" scripts.

The format consists of two lines of table header information,
followed by rows of table data.  The header lines indicate the
column names.  The column information is separated by a single
ASCII tab character.

I hope this format is more useful than the old hand editted format.
With this posting, I am no longer accepting or reporting DHRYSTONE
1.0 benchmark results.  Only those results which are from DHRYSTONE
1.1 and mailed to me on the standard form (see the announcement in
net.arch or net.micro) will be accepted.

I will post the DHRYSTONE 1.1 "C" language source code in a few days.
