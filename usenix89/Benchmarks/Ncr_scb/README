	This is the new NCR System Characterization Benchmark which has
	been offered to all who want it. 

	The SCB posting consists of 4 sections (not the 3 I originally
	stated).  The first consists of the basic config file, several 
	shell scripts, and a consent letter which I would appreciate you
	signing and returning to me by reqular mail.

	The "main" script will compile all of the .c programs and create
	the test files for the disk tests.  The config file should be 
	modified per the instructions in the "help" file, before running
	any other files.

	The "runscb" file will run the scb benchmark and produce a graph.
	The graph must be printed on a printer with 120 or more characters
	per inch, 80 won't do it.

	You must have either an active terminal or a terminal emulator 
	attached to each tty line you specify in the config file.  A 
	terminal emulator consists of:

		DTR ---- DSR
		RTS ---- CTS ---- CD
		TD  open
		SD  open

	The second posting consists of all of the .c programs.

	Posting 3 consists of the full benchmark paper in NROFF format.

	Posting 4 consists of the full benchmark paper in VI format.

	If you have any problems or questions feel free to send me mail.

	Good luck,  Duncan McCorquodale, NCR  E&M Columbia.
