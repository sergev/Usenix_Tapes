  210 ;"This program makes the Commodore 64 operate like a semi-
  220 ;"intellegent 40 or 80 column ascii terminal.  It supports input
  230 ;"and display of all the ASCII characters, and beeps when the BEL
  240 ;"character is received.  Beware that the 80 column display mode
  250 ;"will probably require a monitor unless you are using a B/W
  260 ;"TV set with outstanding sharpness and video bandwidth.
  270 ;
  280 ;"The communication protocol is full duplex, 8 bits, no
  290 ;"parity, 1 stop bit, 300 or 1200 baud, with XON/XOFF (DC1/
  300 ;"DC3) host flow control protocol -- this should satisfy most
  310 ;"host computers.  The display screen is 40 columns X 25 lines
  320 ;"or 80 columns X 25 lines.
  330 ;
  340 ;"Because of the unusual layout of the C64 keyboard, the
  350 ;"desire to support all ascii characters, and a personal
  360 ;"need to find the ESC and BS keys in their usual positions,
  370 ;"the following key substitutions apply (note- ^x is short-
  380 ;"hand for CONTROL-x):

  580 ;"       ^S (DC3)        ^S or HOME
  590 ;"       ^Q (DC1)        ^Q or CURSOR DOWN
  600 ;"       ^I (TAB)        ^I (ie. No separate TAB key)
  610 ;
  620 ;"The CONTROL-8 key is used to switch the program from 40 column
  630 ;"to 80 column mode.  The CONTROL-4 key is used to switch the
  640 ;"program back from 80 column to 40 column mode.  Depressing one
  650 ;"of these keys when already in the corresponding mode will simply
  660 ;"clear the screen (as it does when switching modes).
  670 ;
  680 ;"Note that pressing the COMMODORE key will place the terminal
  690 ;"program in a suspended display mode (ie. the cursor will freeze
  700 ;"at it's current position), and ^S will be sent to the host
  710 ;"computer when the RS-232 input buffer fills up.  Similarly,
  720 ;"pressing the COMMODORE key will remove the terminal from the
  730 ;"suspended display mode and send a ^Q to the host computer only
  740 ;"if a ^S had previously been sent and the buffer has become nearly
  750 ;"empty.  This enables the COMMODORE key to be used like the SCROLL/
  760 ;"NO-SCROLL key on DEC terminals.  Suspended display mode is
  770 ;"indicated to the user by the cursor blinking much faster than
  780 ;"normal, an indication that the COMMODORE key must be pressed to
  790 ;"resume displaying the received text.  The program may also send
  800 ;"^S and ^Q to the host computer on it's own from time to time if
  810 ;"it detects an impending RS-232 buffer overflow condition - this
  820 ;"normally will only occur while printing a number of short or blank
  830 ;"lines while scrolling the screen up (or down), since 4 to 15 char-
  840 ;"acters are received into the RS-232 buffer during the time it
  850 ;"takes to scroll the whole screen.  In any case, this automatic
  860 ;"flow control is fully synchronized with the flow control
  870 ;"necessitated by the use of the COMMODORE key to suspend and resume
  880 ;"the display of received text.  Depressing the ^S and ^Q keys (or
  890 ;"their substitutes indicated above) unconditionally sends those
  900 ;"ASCII characters to the remote host computer without any local
  910 ;"effect.
  920 ;
  930 ;"This terminal program does 'not' support flow control in the
  940 ;"opposite direction - receiving ^S from the host computer will not
  950 ;"lock the keyboard or have any other effect, nor will ^Q.
  960 ;
  970 ;"Also note that pressing the RUN/STOP key with SHIFT depres-
  980 ;"sed will cleanly terminate the terminal emulator program,
  990 ;"and generate the BRK interrupt to send the C64 back
 1000 ;"to whoever is servicing those interrupts (BASIC,
 1010 ;"SUPERMON64,etc).
 1020 ;
 1030 ;"All 94 printable ascii characters and the space will
 1040 ;"be displayed on the screen as received over the RS-232
 1050 ;"channel.  Most of the remaining (control) characters are
 1060 ;"not displayed- however the following control characters
 1070 ;"and escape sequences have special effects:
 1080 ;"
 1090 ;"       CHARACTER       EFFECT
 1100 ;"       ---------       ------
 1110 ;"       ^G (BEL)        beeps the TV
 1120 ;"       ^H (BS)         cursor backspaces
 1130 ;"       ^I (TAB)        cursor moves right to next tab stop
 1140 ;"       ^J (NL)         cursor moves down one line with scrolling
 1150 ;"       ^M (CR)         cursor moves to start of line

 1270 ;"       ^[o             (lowercase o) turns on reverse video
 1280 ;"       ^[^\            initiates downline load
 1290 ;
 1300 ;"Tab stops are pre-defined and fixed at every 8 columns
 1310 ;"beginning with column 0 (ie. 0, 8, 16, 24, ...).
 1320 ;
 1330 ;"The rest should all be pretty much self explanatory except
 1340 ;"for "downline load".  Once the ^[^\ sequence has been re-
 1350 ;"ceived, the program expects lines to come in over the RS-
 1360 ;"232 channel of the form:
 1370 ;
 1380 ;"            ;llhhdddddddddd...
 1390 ;
 1400 ;"where "llhh" is the address for the first byte of data
 1410 ;"on the line (in 6502 low/high format), and "dddddd.."
 1420 ;"are the data bytes themselves - note that the address
 1430 ;"must be 4 hexadecimal digits and each data byte must
 1440 ;"be 2 hexadecimal digits.  The load is terminated normally
 1450 ;"by reception of the control character ^^, or abnormally
 1460 ;"if the user hits a key on the C64 keyboard during the
 1470 ;"load.  In the 40 column mode, It is possible to load anywhere
 1480 ;"in the address ranges $0800 through $9fff and $c000 through
 1490 ;"$cfff since the terminal program itself hides under the BASIC
 1500 ;"ROM (from $a000 through $bfff).  80 column mode should not
 1510 ;"be used to download into the address range $5c00 through
 1520 ;"$7fff because that is where the high resolution video matrix
 1530 ;"and screen image reside in that mode.
 1540 ;
 1550 ;"VAX UNIX users (Berkeley 4.1bsd) will find that the following

 1720 ;"VAX VMS users can probably get away with the following (although
 1730 ;"some VMS programs [eg. edt] require an auxilliary keypad, and do
 1740 ;"not work especially well in 40 column mode):
 1750 ;
 1760 ;"         set term /dev=vt52
 1770 ;"         set term /pag=25
 1780 ;"         set term /wid=80  [or 40, as the case may be]
 1790 ;
 1800 ;"TOPS-20 users can run "emacs" and the like after the following:
 1810 ;
 1820 ;"         term vt52
 1830 ;"         term length 25

 1870 ;"A low pitched beep (much lower than that generated by
 1880 ;"receipt of the BEL character) indicates an error on the
 1890 ;"RS-232 channel (a hit, lost data, etc).
 1900 ;
 1910 ;"Of course, this program assumes you have been able
 1920 ;"to connect a modem (or null modem) to the C64 user
 1930 ;"port, which may or may not be trivial!
 1940 ;
 1950 ;"To run the terminal program, just load it like any BASIC
 1960 ;"program and RUN it.  You will be prompted for the baud
 1970 ;"rate.  Enter either 3 or 300 for 300 baud, 12 or 1200
 1980 ;"for 1200 baud, or just a carriage return for the default
 1990 ;"(300 baud).  If you find communications shaky or impos-
 2000 ;"sible at 1200 baud, you may have to change the poke in
 2010 ;"basic which pokes 0 to poke 8 instead.  If this fails to
 2020 ;"help, try tuning the optional baud rate constants in 0a4f
 2030 ;"and 0a50 for your system clock as described in ref. guide
 2040 ;"page 350 (use poke of 0 into 0a4d in this case).
 2050 ;
 2060 ;"Once it has been run, the terminal program moves itself
 2070 ;"under the BASIC ROM and runs there (although the original
 2080 ;"copy remains where it was loaded and can be re-run as long
 2090 ;"as it remains intact).  The memory map at run time is:
 2100 ;
 2110 ;"       $a080-$afff     The program area
 2120 ;"       $b000-$b1ff     Unused
 2130 ;"       $b200-$b2ff     RS-232 output buffer
 2140 ;"       $b300-$b3ff     RS-232 input buffer
 2150 ;"       $b400-$b7ff     Video matrix (the 40 column screen)
 2160 ;"       $b800-$bfff     Character set for 40 column mode
 2170 ;"       $02a7-$02b6     Termination/Restart code
 2180 ;
 2190 ;"In addition, the following memory areas are used only while the
 2200 ;"program is in the 80 column mode:
 2210 ;
 2220 ;"       $5c00-$5fff     Video matrix (the 80 column color memory)
 2230 ;"       $6000-$7fff     Hires screen (the 80 column screen)
 2240 ;
 2250 ;"Once the terminal program has been terminated (with SHIFT/
 2260 ;"RUN/STOP), it may be re-started by re-running the original
 2270 ;"BASIC program.  However, if the BASIC program area has been
 2280 ;"over-written during downloading, the terminal program can
 2290 ;"still be restarted (at the same baud rate as before) with
 2300 ;"the BASIC direct command "(686)" ; this command will
 2310 ;"restart the terminal program at any time, even after running
 2320 ;"other programs, unless some program is run which pokes
 2330 ;"into the areas shown in the first map above.
 2340 ;
 2350 ;"One last warning: this program is not relocatable - do
 2360 ;"not change the *length* of the BASIC program or nothing
 2370 ;"will work!
