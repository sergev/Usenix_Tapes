Since there has been so much interest lately in the NEC v20/v30 chips, I
thought some of you might find this useful. It's a little utility to run
CP/M programs using the v20's 8080 emulation mode.

I found this on a BBS, so the usual caveats apply. Running the program with
no parameters will give instructions.

What follows is not a shar, it is a uuencoded binary. Therefore, you should
uudecode it and download it to your system using some program such as
kermit, umodem, or sb. (NOTE: don't forget to set whatever options are
needed for BINARY transfers.)

Have fun...
