I have found this program useful over the past eight months.  About four
months ago, I was moved to a XELOS system (our proprietary version of
System V) and found the format options of the 'date(1)' routine.  To make
the program more useful, I modified Dan LaLiberte's set of options to
more closely imitate the set of options in the 'date(1)' routine.  Although
I've been using this now for about three months in this form, my workload
has finally slowed down enough to allow me the time to post this to 
net.sources.

I would like to thank Dan LaLiberte for posting his original routine.
To give credit where credit is due, here are excerpts from the header
of the original posting:

The recent date-oriented postings prompted me to finally get this out.  
What prompted its creation was the fact that I had to write yet another
single-purpose add-something-to-the-current-date program.  Also, I noticed a
recent posting of a script that used `at` with a "+ #" option that we do
not have.  

Now you can do things like:
	at `date+ 2 hours` < reminder
or	set lastmonth = `date+ -1 month "%y.%n"`

Date+ has more options than I know what to do with, but it's the kind of
program that needs options.  So send me your suggestions.  It is written
for Berkeley 4.2.
