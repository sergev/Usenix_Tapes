Here's a very short one. Its major defect is that it does not handle
*setting* the date (by itself, anyway). I wrote it to show am/pm rather
than 24 hour, but the display part is pretty trivial (i.e. easy to change).
The only real virtue of this program is that it demonstrates how easy it
is to do something like date(1).
