I had two complaints of mangled files, I fixed a few bugs in code that I
had modified just before posting (sorry), and added some documentation of
a previously undocumented but useful feature ('/' command).  For these
reasons, I am reposting this source.  I never seem to be able to get these
things out in one try.  Maybe next time.
