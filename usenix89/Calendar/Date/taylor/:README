So there I was after having used the date(1) command on HP-UX (System V
with some neat enhancements, etc etc) and I got onto a Vax running BSD
Unix.  Well!  The date(1) command on BSD doesn't have all the neat
functionality that the HP-UX one has, so I rewrote the BSD date command!
What follows is a *nonshar* (too lazy) that contains the "C" source to
the newdate program and the man entry too.

The enhancement is that the user can now specify exactly what the
output format is to look like.  You can now have 'date' output a
format like "Today is Friday, December 12, 1986 at 4:50 pm" rather
than the old, boring stuff.  Neat, eh?

This has been enhanced too - I've added (among others) %z to output the
current timezone, so even you system V users should be interested!

Bugs, etc, to comp.sources.d please.
