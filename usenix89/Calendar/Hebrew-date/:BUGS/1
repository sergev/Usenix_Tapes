Following complaints about the posted Hebrew calendar program not
being portable, I  have done some re-writing. The  new version is
still not  portable anywhere, but at  least the machine-dependent
parts are concentrated in one place.  The main problem is that it
needs  34-bit  integers;  if  your machine  can  cope,  it's  ok,
otherwise,  I have  tried to  put in  some pointers  to help  you
transport. If you are interested, write me and I'll mail it.
