Following is the C version of hdate.c, a program to convert to/from
Hebrew dates, with a man page, and hcal.c, a cal-like program
that prints a Hebrew/Gregorian calendar.

This program was written on a VAX, so it assumes 32-bit 'int's (actually
it needs at least 36 bits, but I worked around it using 'double').
If your machine has smaller 'int's, you'll have to change some of them
to 'long's (sorry, I never checked which).

The HEBREW option is to print the output on a Hebrew printer; the REV
option is for such printers that don't change print direction when switching
to Hebrew font (i.e., almost all of them).

A fortran-77 (and bc!) version is also avilable, but the user interface is
much uglier.
	Good Luck!
