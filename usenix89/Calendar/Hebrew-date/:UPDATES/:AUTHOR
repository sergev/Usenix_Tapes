Due to  the growing number  of requests,  and the sorry  state of
some mailers (some  of my replies have bounced  4 times already!)
I've  decided to  post  the new  version to  the  net. It's  more
streamlined, and the machine-dependent parts are concentrated for
easier porting,  though I cannot guarantee  it'll run everywhere.
Good luck!

Following is  a shar file of  the new release. Cut  below and run
through sh; watch out for the signature at the end. Khag Sameach!
