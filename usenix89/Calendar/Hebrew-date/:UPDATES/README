This  is the  2nd distribution  of  hdate/hcal. It  is still  not
portable anywhere,  but at least the  machine-dependent parts are
concentrated  in one  place. The  main problem  is that  it needs
34-bit integers; if  your machine can cope,  just #define BIGLONG
in  hdate.h,   otherwise  re-write  the  routines   'muldiv'  and
'mulmod'. The  given version is for  the VAX, plus a  double f.p.
workaround for machines with enough precision.

You'll have to re-#define MINWEST to reflect your local time zone
in minutes  west of Greenwich; this  is done to prevent  DST from
taking  effect (since  Hebrew  dates change  at  sunset), and  to
simplify calculation (i.e. I was lazy).

Other #define's  are HEBREW to  make a  version that prints  on a
hebrew printer, and REV if that printer does not change direction
when switching to Hebrew (that is, almost any printer I know of).
The output is in lower-case letters, so you'll still need to pipe
it through 'tr' or 'sed' to convert to what your printer expects.
(In my case it's sed 's/[`-z][`-z]*/^[n&^O/g').

The files included  herein are: README - this file,  explain - an
explanation of the algorithm, hdate.6 - the man page (nroff/troff
source), Makefile, hdate.h - common definitions, hdate.c & hcal.c
- main  source files  of hdate  & hcal, hcom.c  - code  common to
both.
