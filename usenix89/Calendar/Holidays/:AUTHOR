Every wanted to get involved with Sexigisma?  But didn't know when to?
Were you a little shy and weren't sure when to run on Sadie Hawkins Day?
Here is a program that will tell you all that and more.  It lists
holidays for a given year.

It reconstructs the recent past so that it will not tell you about
things that didn't happen.  It tries to predict the future on the
basis of the way things are (How much better can it do?).  This is 
an expert system for holidays.

Unpack in its own directory, make and enjoy it.
