I was having trouble with remind(1) which was posted
with calend(1), et al.  I had my terminal set with
tostop (stty tostop).  In order for remind(1) to work
with tostop set, you have to ignore SIGTTOU.  In the
code, search for SIGTSTP.  You will see signals being
ignored.  Here is how my remind.c looks:

#ifdef SIGTSTP
	(void) signal(SIGTSTP, SIG_IGN);
#endif
#ifdef SIGTTOU
	(void) signal(SIGTTOU, SIG_IGN);
#endif

The problem was the process was getting SIGTTOU and
quitting, leaving me at my terminal way past the time I
needed to leave.  While poking around, I found some
rather unportable code.  This has to do with the array,
nv.  It should be struct tm.  But that is not a bug (yet).
