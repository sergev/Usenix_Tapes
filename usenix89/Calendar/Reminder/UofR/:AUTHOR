I'm getting tired of seeing discussion in this group - they belong in
net.sources.d (hint, hint). So I'm posting something.

Here is a quick hack I did to use MH as an appointment diary. It is
only known to work on 4.2 BSD. Yes, it could be faster. Yes, there are
many things lacking. No, I don't have the time now. So if you make any
improvements, do let me know and I will incorporate your ideas/work in
the next version, if there is one.

	Have fun, Ken
