	In a recent issue of mod.protocols.kermit a new version
	of Prime kermit was announced.  After loading it to our
	systems i found that the supplied software to break up 
	the files did not want to work.  


	For those of you who need this version of kermit
	this module will unpack it for you on almost any
	unix system and on the Prime under Primos if you have
	the c compiler

	Have fun! and thanks for all the fish.
