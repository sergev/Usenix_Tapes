.SH DESCRIPTION
This program uses error correcting protocol to receive
files over a serial port from a variety of programs running under
PC-DOS, CP/M,
.SM Unix,
and other operating systems.

The first form of
.B rz
(Receive Batch)
receives files with ZMODEM batch protocol.
If the sending program does not support ZMODEM,
.B rz
steps down to YMODEM protocol
after 50 seconds.
This delay can be eliminated by calling the program as
.I rb .

.B Rb
accepts either standard 128 byte sectors or
1024 byte sectors
(YAM
.B -k
option).
The user should determine experimentally
the conditions under which use of 1k blocks
actually improves throughput without causing
problems.

Normally, the file contents are converted to
.SM Unix
conventions by stripping carriage returns and all characters
beginning with Control Z (CP/M end of file).
If the raw pathname ends in
".A",
".ARC",
".CCC",
".CL",
".CMD",
".COM",
".CRL",
".DAT",
".DIR",
".EXE",
".O",
".OBJ",
".OVL",
".PAG",
".REL",
".SAV",
".SUB",
".SWP",
".SYS",
".TAR",
".UTL",
".a",
".o",
".tar",
or if the first packet contains
data that suggest a binary file
(parity bits or characters in the range 000 to 006 before the first ^Z),
or if the file mode is transmitted and the 0100000
bit is set, that file will be received in binary mode anyway.
Otherwise,
if the raw pathname ends in .MSG, or .TXT, an existing file will
be appended to rather than replaced.

If extended file information (file length, etc.)
is received,
the file length controls the number of bytes written to
the output dataset (YMODEM only),
and the modify time and file mode
(iff non zero)
are set accordingly.

If no extended file information is received,
slashes in the pathname are changed to underscore,
and any trailing period in the pathname is eliminated.
This conversion is useful for files received from CP/M systems.
Normally, each file name is converted to lower case
unless it contains one or more lower case letters.


The second form of
.B rz
receives a single
.I file
with XMODEM protocol.
The user must supply the file name to both sending and receiving programs.


The third form of
.B rz
is invoked as
.B rzCOMMAND
(with an optional leading \- as generated by login(1)).
For each received file,
rz will pipe the file to ``COMMAND filename''
where filename is the name of the transmitted file
with the file contents as standard input.

Each file transfer is acknowledged when COMMAND exits with 0 status.
A non zero exit status terminates transfers.

A typical use for this form is
.I rzrmail
which calls rmail(1)
to post mail to the user specified by the transmitted file name.
For example, sending the file "caf" from a PC-DOS system to
.I rzrmail
on a
.SM Unix
system
would result in the contents of the DOS file "caf" being mailed to user "caf".

On some
.SM Unix
systems, the login directory must contain a link to
COMMAND as login sets SHELL=rsh which disallows absolute
pathnames.
If invoked with a leading ``v'',
.B rz
will report progress to LOGFILE.
The following entry works for
.SM Unix
3.0:
.ce
rzrmail::5:1::/bin:/usr/local/rzrmail
If the SHELL environment variable includes
.I "rsh"
or
.I "rksh"
(restricted shell),
rz will not accept absolute pathnames
or references to a parent directory,
will not modify an existing file, and
removes any files received in error.

If
.B rz
is invoked with stdout and stderr to different datasets,
Verbose is set to 2, causing frame by frame progress reports
to stderr.
This may be disabled with the
.B q
option.

.PP
The meanings of the available options are:
.PP
.PD 0
.TP
.B 1
Use file descriptor 1 for ioctls and reads (Unix only).
By default, file descriptor 0 is used.
This option allows
.B rz
to be used with the
.I cu
~$
command.
.TP
.B b
Transfer all files in binary
(tell it like it is)
mode.
This option disables file append.
.TP
.B c
Request 16 bit CRC
(XMODEM file transfers default to 8 bit checksum).
Batch transfers use 16 bit CRC.
.TP
.B D
Output file data to /dev/null; for testing.
.TP
.B q
Quiet suppresses verbosity.
.TP
.B v
Verbose
causes a list of file
names to be appended to
/tmp/rzlog .
More v's generate more output.
.TP
.B u
Retain upper case letters in file names.
.PD
.SH EXAMPLES
.ne 6
.RE
(Pro-YAM command)
.RS
.I <ALT-2>
.br
YAM Command:
.I "sz *.h *.c"
.br
(This automatically invokes
.I rz
on the connected system.)

Compile time options required
for various operating systems are described in the
source file.
.SH BUGS
Pathnames are restricted to 127 characters.
In XMODEM single file mode, the pathname given on the command line
is still processed as described above.
The CR/LF to NL translation merely deletes CR\'s;
undos(omen) performs a more intelligent translation.
.SH "VMS VERSION"
Some of the #includes with file names enclosed with angle brackets <>
may need to have the angle brackets changed to "", or vice versa.

The VMS version does not set binary mode according to the incoming
file type.
Non binary file processing consists of stripping all characters beginning
with CPMEOF (^Z).

The VMS version does not set the file time.

At high speeds,
VMS sometimes loses incoming characters, resulting in retries
and degradation of throughput.

The mysterious
VMS C Standard I/O Package and RMS may interact to modify
file contents unexpectedly.

The VMS version does not support invocation as
.B rzCOMMAND .
ZMODEM has not yet been implemented on the VMS version.
.SH "ZMODEM CAPABILITIES"
.B Rz
supports incoming ZMODEM binary (-b), ASCII (-a), and append (-+)
requests, and ZMODEM command execution.
.SH FILES
rz.c, rbsb.c, zm.c, zmodem.h source files.

/tmp/rzlog stores debugging output generated with -vv option.
