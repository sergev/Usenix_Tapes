XUM is a xmodem protocol package for BSD 4.2 unix. I don't know if it
will work with other flavors of unix but it likes BSD 4.2 just fine.
The man page for xum makes a reference to a program called wsstrip
so I have included that one also. It will take a wordstar format file
and take out all the funny characters so that vi will not complain.

XUM was written with the novice unix user in mind; there are no command
line options (though I would like to put them in someday). Instead, it is
menu driven so the novice users will not bang their heads against the wall
try to figure out which options to select. In other words I tried to make
it village-idiot proof.

The thing that distinguishes xum from other xmodem packages is the way
in which I wrote it. It is VERY modular. If you want to incorporate xmodem
i/o in another package you are writing then just use the termio.c, termio.h,
and xmodemio.c files; all that you need to pass to send or receive a
file with xmodem i/o is your terminal fid and a file fid. Also, the termio
package can be used by itself for setting modes on a terminal, allocating
a terminal, and using termcap to perform simple screen i/o without having
to go through the bother of using curses or writing your own code.

Any comments or suggestions would be appreciated.
