Normally I hesitate to netmail large files but in view of the
importance of this I am making an exception.  Whenever a major change
to a file transfer protocol is proposed, it's important for all
interested persons to be heard.

This file has been "tabified" on 8-column stops to reduce the
filesize, and formfeed characters have been replaced with the WordStar
new page directive .PA at the left margin.  If you don't have WS, just
edit the file and replace all occurances of newline .PA with Control-L
(formfeed).  The .OP directive at the start tells WS to omit the page
numbers (since they're already in the file) - delete it if you don't
have WS.
