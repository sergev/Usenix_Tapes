Part 1 or two parts of Unix/Xenix etc.  programs rz and sz for ZMODEM, YMODEM,
and XMODEM file transfers.  This posting corrects problems experienced with a
few Unix systems.

When used in conjunction with a comm program that supports AutoDownload, these
programs provide seamless and effortless file transfers with optimum efficiency,
minimum Unix CPU utilization, and throughput.  ZMODEM preserves the
modification date and the exact length and contents of transferred files.  A
file transfer interrupted by a line disconnect or system crash can be resumed
without having to start over.  Files may be selectively transferred, skipping
over those where the destination file is newer or precious.  ASCII files can be
converted between Unix and DOS conventions.

ZMODEM was developed for the public domain under contract from Telenet.  ZMODEM
provides optimum throughput with packet switched networks and/or high speed
buffered modems.  It is the speed champion in tests with the TrailBlazer high
speed modems at Telebit corp.  Its overhead is low enough to make it a
desireable application to application total error checking protocol which
catches errors that still occur even in today's "error-free" networks.  The 32
bit CRC gives a high assurance that data errors do not pass undetected.
