Compile instructions are located in the comments at the beginning of the rz.c
ans sz.c files.  The main compiler flags are -DV7 for V7 and BSD systems and
-DSVR2 for sVr2.  Other #ifdefs in the files may be activated to deal with
various types of kernel brain damage if you have a mutant system.

Naturally, rz ans sz work best with comm programs that seamlessly support ZMODEM
command and file AutoDownload (PowerCOm, Pro-YAM and ZCOMM).  Ths DOS "DSZ"
sub-program allows ZMODEM file transfers with older programs, but it must be
called manually.  DSZ and the ZMODEM protocol description are on TeleGodzilla
and other bulletin boards.  They may be obtained via UUCP from site "omen", for
which a direct UUCP login and telephone number are provided below.  You may uucp
~uucp/FILES first to determine the pathnames for the "goodies".
