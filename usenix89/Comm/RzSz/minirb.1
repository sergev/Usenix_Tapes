.TH MINIRB 1 OMEN
.SH NAME
minirb \- Bootstrap YMODEM Batch file receive
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B minirb
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Minirb
receives one or more files with YMODEM batch file transfer protocol.
.I Minirb
was developed for use as a bootstrap to simplify uploading of the longer
.I rz
and
.I sz
programs contained in the
.I rzsz1et2.sh
shell archive.
.SH SEE ALSO
YMODEM.DOC,
Professional-YAM manual,
sz(omen),
usq(omen),
undos(omen)
.SH NOTES
The source file
.I minirb.c
has been ruthlessly pruned to simplify uploading without benefit of
any file transfer protocol.
Do not reformat or add tabs to the source file
as this would complicate uploading.

Please read the uploading suggestions in the chapter
.I "File Transfer Basics"
in the Professional-YAM or ZCOMM user's manual.

.I Minirb
uses 8 bit checksum which may not be compatible with some programs
claiming to support YMODEM batch transfers.

.I Minirb
uses the
YMODEM header
file length information
to prevent extraneous characters.
.I Minirb
does not delete carriage returns from uploaded files.
It does not delete ^Z or other padding added by some CP/M or PC-DOS
programs, including the Xenix "doscp" command.

.I Minirb
calls stty(1) to set and reset raw tty mode.
