In response to the several requests for this over the past week
or so, following is a "shar" file of one of the many UMODEM
programs that float around.  It is fairly primitive, but it 
does work.  It can be improved, but doing so may not be worth
the effort.  Be aware that the various improvements to implement
ARPA FTP transfers are not documented in the manual pages below.
The source code is quite clear on this, as are the 'help' menus.
