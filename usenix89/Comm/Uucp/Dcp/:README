Some time ago I wrote a "from-scratch" uucp clone for use on our DG AOS machine
(with its brain-damaged uucp, useless to us and DG being no help).
Later I ported it to MS-DOS and VAX/VMS and its been working fine for a year
(Ive also hacked up a "rmail" for use between machines.)
Recently, with the help of John Gilmore, I was able to get the "g" protocol
realy workin (window size > 1). Previously all I could figure out was a
degenerate "g" proto using 1-window.
Im not crazy enough to say its perfect, but it does work.
Although this is a two-way (master+slave) uucico clone, compared to John's
uuslave, the coding and portibility has much to be desired. (This
project started as just an internal attempt to connect our DG to the world).
In any case for what its worth, Here it is.......
Hope everyone finds it useful.
As were not a real unix site, Id appreciate all correspondence thru
mail and not NEWS. (It took me most of last week to drum up a way to
post stuf to USENET writting a NNTP program).
