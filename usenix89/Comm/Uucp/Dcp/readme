-------Notes on dcp.-------------------
---R.H.Lamb 6/86----------------------
Fix dcps.h for right system
Fix rmail.c for local mailer or no (#define LCLMAIL)
For PC compile comm.asm & dcpasm.asm files
Compile the rest of the .c files
Link dcp+ .c except rmail.c files + (comm+dcpasm for PC)
Link rmail
**************Finished creation**************
Modify "systems" for your site 
Modify "userfile" for your site
**************Ready to run ******************
To que up mail in current directory type
		rmail mit-eddie!lids!lamb <CR> or <NL>
		Enter your message here ending with a line with only a "."
(Note: rmail does not presently put things in RFC820 format. A "filter"
	program piped into rmail could do this easily. With out this 
	format things work ok, but youll see "Apparently to" s in your 
	mail.)
To read incomming mail type
		rmail <CR> or <NL>
		followed by <CR> or <NL> for each message
To send/receive files type
		dcp master 3 <CR>
		Where the last number is debug level
		(0 is least)

--------VMS notes--------
To send mail in VMS note:
rmail "a!b!c" 
message
(Those dammed "."'s screwed up my posting on the first run >.<)

To send a file in VMS using redirected I/O (example "ss")
ss "rmail ""a!b!c" file nl:

In VMS host names with "_,-,?,&" are no good.
Make sure who you talk to has a simple name like "dgvax"

"userfile" should have
TT: for local console
0 for speed (use default speed on logon)

BUGS!!!!
The spawn command in dcxqt (lib$spawn in dcpvms) seems to work
only for small files. Redirection of input file to "rmail" larger than
a certain size get lost.
Cause is differing record file formats. Presently its a kludge that
runs "CONVERT/FDL=VAR" on the input files. Please- an VMS C hacker FIX.
