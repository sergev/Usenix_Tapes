		    NEW ARCHIVE SITE AT UCSF
------------------------------------------------------------------------
I will be glad to respond to requests for material but this does not
represent an ongoing commitment for the installation.  Anyone
requesting material via mail should supply a path from ucbvax.  Anyone
requesting tape should contact me first.

		ANONYMOUS UUCP ACCESS AVAILABLE AT CUAE2
------------------------------------------------------------------------

This file explains how to get files from the mod.sources archive being
maintained by the AT&T Application Engineering Division in Lisle, IL.
This is not an official service of AT&T and may be discontinued at any
time.  The contents of the mod.sources archive have been donated by
the submitters of the files to the Usenet mod.sources moderator for
free availability throughout the community.  AT&T assumes no responsibility
for the contents of these files, including the suitability for their
use in any application on any hardware.  (Some of the material, for
example is known not to run on systems sold by AT&T.)  Any questions
about suitability, problems with the software or documentation, or
anything else related to the contents of the files should be directed
to the persons who submitted the material originally (usually the
authors).

(Now that I think I've covered my behind sufficiently...)

The mod.sources archives are currently resident on an AT&T 3B20A
computer running UNIX System V Release 2.1.  This system is used
for real work during working hours on weekdays, as well as a little
bit evenings and weekends.  (We're kinda nuts.)  To be able to
separate and control access to the mod.sources archives from uucp
accesses related to our actual jobs, I have configured the UUCP (HDB)
system to provide what looks like a machine named "cuaepd" (for bldg CU,
Application Engineering, Public Domain material) to caller machines
that log in with the login "pduucp".  This also lets us move the
archives to a separate machine, if we want to later, without disrupting
too many people.

The following description of how to set up your system's uucp config
files is based on the Honey DanBer UUCP (AT&T Basic Networking Utilities)
implementation, as it's the only one I've used that made any sense.
You may have to adjust what I say to fit your system's requirements.

The phone number for "cuaepd" is (currently) 1-312-964-3773.  There are
two lines hunted on that number.  The modems will answer at 1200bps with
a "login:" prompt.  (We intend to expand the number of lines, upgrade
them to 1200/2400bps, and change the phone number in the next couple
of months.)  In response to the login prompt, your system should send
the login id, "pduucp".  There is no password associated with this id.
All this is turned off between about 6 a.m. and 6 p.m. Chicago time
Monday through Friday, so we can get our real work done, so don't
bother trying it during those periods.  (Chicago has Daylight S.T.)

The Systems file entry for doing this looks something like:
(for HoneyDanBer UUCP users)
	cuaepd Wk1830-0530,Sa,Su ACU 1200 chicago9643773 in:--in: pduucp
(for Old UUCP users)
	cuaepd Any1830-0530 ACU 1200 chicago9643773 in:--in: pduucp

Once you have your system set up to place an outgoing UUCP call to
"cuaepd", you can retrieve material from the archives.  This file is
file cuaepd!~/netnews/mod.sources/howto.snarf.  The current directory
of what is stored in the mod.sources archives is found in the file
cuaepd!~/netnews/mod.sources/directory.  To get either of these,
execute a command like:
	uucp cuaepd!~/netnews/mod.sources/howto.snarf !~/MYNAME/
	uucp cuaepd!~/netnews/mod.sources/directory !~/MYNAME/

The directory is simply the output from "ls -sRxF" on the mod.sources
archive disk hierarchy.  It is updated just before 6 p.m. every day.
Here is a sample from the directory.

----------
This sample shows part of the first volume of mod.sources.  The
entries with a slash "/" at the end of their names are directories,
whose contents are detailed below (e.g. UK-1.1).  The number preceding
each name is the approximate size of the file in 512 byte blocks.
Entries whose name ends with a ".Z" have been compressed by the
program compress 4.0, which can be found (in uncompressed form) in
volume 2.  Multi-part distributions typically are set up with all
parts in a subdirectory of the volume directory.  This means you
can snarf just the parts you've missed, instead of having to get
the whole thing.

Old versions are not yet being deleted with any regularity, so be
sure to look carefully to be sure you are getting the latest version
available.  Also, look for "index" files that have more information
on the contents of the various packages.

NOTE: Please be aware that uucp commands asking for file names containing
wild cards will almost certainly not work.  This is because the
implementations I know of submit a uux job to the remote system asking
it to run "uucp" on the wild card filename.  Systems logging in with
"pduucp" are prohibited from executing "uucp" or other commands via "uux".
So, be sure to ask for each file separately.

If you can't figure out why it doesn't work, re-read this file.  If you
still have trouble, talk with your system administrator.  If you are the
system administrator, send electronic mail to me and I'll see what I can
do.  Suggestions are always welcome.  Compliments and thanks are even more so.
