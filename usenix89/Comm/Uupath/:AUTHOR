Here's a marginally useful program that displays the full
uucp route or path by consulting the pathaliases file using
the 4.2 dbm(3) routines.  It works at our site running news 2.10.3
beta version from seismo.

WARNING: Pure S3/S5 sites don't have dbm(3), so it wont work.
Don't think of using any Public Domain dbm() routines (are there
any around?), because 2.10.3 for USG sites doesn't store the
history dbm files in history.pag nor history.dir files.
I have decided not to post it to mod.sources until it is fixed
to work at USG sites.

There are plenty of comments at the beginning of the source to read.
