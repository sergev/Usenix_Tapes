The uuq command posted awhile ago is useful. I added a -t option, which
allows you to "touch" the command and data files for a particular uucp job
to prevent it from automatically being erased on those systems that delete
pending jobs after a certain amount of time. The diffs follow for both
uuq.c and the man page, uuq.1.  There's probably a .signature file at the
end to watch out for.
