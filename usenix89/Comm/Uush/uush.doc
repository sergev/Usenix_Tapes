NAME
     uush - remote shell via uucp (uucp shell)

SYNOPSIS
     uush [uush_opts] [shell_opts] [command_file] [command_args]
     uush [uush_opts] [shell_opts] [-c remote_command]
     [command_args]

DESCRIPTION
     Uush is the front end processor to a UUCP-shell on some
     remotely connected site.  Uush has three types of options:
           1) 'uush' options,
           2) remote '/bin/sh' options,
           3) command file options.
     In the first set, options and arguments must appear next to
     each other with no space. For example, 'uush -Uusername' and
     not 'uush -U username'. Valid Uush options are listed below:
           -Ssystem         Run on 'system'
           -Uuser           Run on 'system' as 'user'
           -Ppath:path...   Run with PATH=path:path...
           -Xxqtdir         Run in 'xqtdir'
           -Mmailbox        Mail output to relative 'mailbox'
           -Fumask          Run with umask set to 'umask'
           -V               set verbose options
     Once a '-c' or non-minus argument is seen on the command
     line, then Uush options are no longer scaned for; the rest
     of the options are assumed to be intended for /bin/sh or for
     the commandfile.

     Uush also scans for an explite '-c' option which indicates
     that the next argument is a remote command or remote
     command-file. If no '-c' option is present, then the
     command-file name is taken to be the name of a local
     bourne-shell script; and if no command-file name is present,
     then the commands are taken from standard input.

     Uush will then create a data file and ship if off to the
     requested host via uux(1) where the program uush.uu will
     unpack the data and execute the commands. A mail message
     will be generated on the remote system containing a header
     section followed by the standard output and standard error
     of the commands.

     If the file $HOME/.uushrc is present on the system where the
     Uush command was issued, then it is assumed to be a bourne
     shell script that can help setup default parameters for each
     host.  For example:
          case $R_SYS in
               test1)    R_MBOX=foo@bar;;
               *)   R_SYS=aus3b5
                    R_MBOX=`uname -n`!$USER;;
          esac

UUSH(1-uucpsup)   Pyramid OSx Operating System    UUSH(1-uucpsup)



     When Uush profiles $HOME/.uushrc, the variable R_SYS is set
     from the -Ssystem option. If no -Ssystem option is given,
     the the above example would set it to "aus3b5" and set the
     default remote mail-box as well.

     Variables which may be set in $HOME/.uushrc include:

                     UUSH
           VARIABLE  OPTN DESCRIPTION
           R_UMASK  -F   Remote file creation mask.
           R_USER   -U   Remote user name (obsolute).
           R_PATH   -P   Remote path to execute commands from.
           R_MBOX   -M   Name of the remote mailbox.
           R_XQT    -X   Remore directory to execute commands on.
           R_SYS    -S   Name of remote system

     Uush options always have presidence over variables set/reset
     in $HOME/.uushrc because the options are scaned before and
     after the reading of this file.

EXAMPLES
           egg mkdir . /tmp | uush -Saussjo -F0 -X/tmp
                 executes commands generated by 'egg' on !aussjo,
                 in /tmp directory, with umask set to 0000.

           uush -V -Saussjo file.sh
                 reads local file.sh and runs on !aussjo.

           uush -V -Saussjo -c 'file.sh'
                 runs the command 'sh -c file.sh' on !aussjo

FILES
     $HOME/.uushrc  -- bourne shell init script
     system!/usr/local/uubin/uush.uu -- remotely executed shell
     script

BUGS
     This program breaks all of the security rules. It might be
     wise to make a front end set-uid program that is executed
     instead of "uush.uu". Eg:  uush -> uux -> set_uid -> sh
     uush.uu. For this reason, it is recommended that it be
     installed only on internal sites.
     The -c option doesn't work as expected (will be fixed
     later), only the first option after '-c' is recognized
     remotely. Eg: "uush -c echo 1 2 3" really becomes "uush -c
     echo". It is better to simply "echo echo 1 2 3 | uush".
