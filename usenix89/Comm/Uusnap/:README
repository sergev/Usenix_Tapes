A few weeks ago I posted a request for a uusnap for System 5
uucp's with a "flat" uucp spool directory.  Prior to that request,
I already had a private tool that I call "uustatd" (UUcp STATistics
on spool Directory), but I was hoping to receive a better tool.

By the way, seismo!rick responded that it would be simple to
to change 4.2's uusnap.c to handle "flat" directories.  I
spent a short period of time attempting this, but found that
a major rework is still needed because of the way the remote
machine name is embedded in X.machine* files.  Our version of
uucp stores all execute files in the form "D.localX*", where local
is our local site (rlgvax).  However, the version of uusnap.c
for 4.2 assumes that X files are stored in the form "X.remote*".
To find the machine associated with the D.localX file requires
that the C.remote* file be read.
As a result of this, the hacked up uusnap reports 0 X.* files
for all machines, and reports lots of D.* files destined to
our local machine.

Below is the uustatd program.
