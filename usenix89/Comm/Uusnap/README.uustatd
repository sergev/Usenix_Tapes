This is a uucp statistics program for uucp's that use the "flat"
spool directory.

To install it:
	Edit machine.h and config.h so that config.h properly defines
	either DIRFIXLEN or DIRVARLEN.  See the comments in the
	Makefile for what these mean.

	Change INSTALLDIR in Makefile.

	make			# make a local copy of uustatd

	su root

	make install		# install it whereever it goes

	uustatd			# try running the program

LAST,
	Report any bugs or improvements to {seismo}!rlgvax!dennis.
