Several requests have been made lately for a XMODEM/YMODEM program to
support file transfer to or from micros.  What follows is my adaptation of
a previous XMODEM program.  It runs on 4.2/4.3BSD systems only.  I
submitted this same exact package to mod.sources almost three months ago,
so when the dam bursts in that newsgroup, you might see this program again.
