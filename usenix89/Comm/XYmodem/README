The xmodem program implements the Christensen (XMODEM) file transfer
protocol for moving files between 4.2/4.3BSD Unix systems and microcomputers.
The XMODEM/CRC protocol, the MODEM7 batch protocol, the XMODEM-1K
block protocol and the YMODEM batch protocol are all supported by xmodem.
For details of the protocols, see the document edited by Chuck Forsberg titled
XMODEM/YMODEM Protocol Reference.

This program runs on 4.2/4.3BSD systems ONLY.  It has been tested on VAXes
and Suns against the MEX-PC program from Niteowl Software.

I have tried to keep the 4.2isms (select system call, 4.2BSD/v7 tty structures,
gettimeofday system call, etc.) confined to the source file getput.c; but I 
make no guarantees.  Also, I have made no attempt to keep variable names 
under 7 characters.


Program history:

Descended from UMODEM 3.5 by Lauren Weinstein, Richard Conn, and others.

Based on XMODEM Version 1.0 by Brian Kantor, UCSD (3/84)  (Don't blame him 
for what follows....)

Version 2.0 (CRC-16 and Modem7 batch file transfer) (5/85)

Version 2.1 (1K packets) (7/85)

Version 2.2 (general clean-ups and multi-character read speed-ups) (9/85)

Version 2.3 (nap while reading packets; split into several source files) (1/86)

Version 3.0 (Ymodem batch receive; associated changes) (2/86)

Version 3.1 (Ymodem batch send; associated changes) (8/86)

Version 3.2 (general cleanups) (9/86)
