Every time I get a version of the rz and sz programs and try to compile
them I get the same problem -- the linker says that the symbol _noxread2
is undefined.  What is mysterious is that this symbol does not appear in
the source code!  The closest I can find is noxread7, and I can't
imagine how the system changes the 7 into a 2.  Has anyone run into
this, or have any ideas?

The system is a Wicat 160 running UniSoft system V ver. 2.  I've had the
same problem with at least three different releases of rz and sz.
