.SH NAME
minirb \- Bootstrap YMODEM Batch file receive
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B minirb
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Minirb
receives one or more files with YMODEM batch file transfer protocol.
.I Minirb
was developed for use as a bootstrap to simplify uploading of the longer
.I rz
and
.I sz
programs contained in the
.I rzsz1et2.sh
shell archive.
.SH SEE ALSO
YMODEM.DOC,
Professional-YAM manual,
sz(omen),

undos(omen)
.SH NOTES
The source file
.I minirb.c
has been ruthlessly pruned to simplify uploading.
.I Minirb
uses 8 bit checksum which may not be compatible with all programs
claiming to support YMODEM batch transfers.
.I Minirb
calls stty(1) to set and reset raw tty mode.
