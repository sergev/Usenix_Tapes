Rev A of mix.c (re-posted to net.sources on Apr 14, 1987) is modified
to leave the last byte (newline) of a file undisturbed.  Before changing
over to the new version, files encoded with the old version should be
decoded with the old version; or alternately a newline should be
appended to the old cyphertext.

     BRIEF:
     In-place (non-filter) encoding/decoding of ASCII files, using
     an interactively acquired key, or the value of the environment
     variable MIXKEY, or one constructed from user's effective user id.
     Shuffles the bytes of the file; the retained character set
     permits ASCII file transfers.  Provides the key holder immediate
     access (vi, grep, make, etc.) to scrambled files such that the
     scrambled nature of the files is transparent.  The objects
     edmix, keymix, unmix, catmix are links of mix, argv[0] is
     hashed to decode context.
