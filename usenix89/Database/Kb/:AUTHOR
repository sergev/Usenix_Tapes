.SH DESCRIPTION
.\" semantics
kb (Knowledge Base) is a simple database to store items of
information under certain key words. The items can then be
retrieved from this database via the key words.
.sp
kba [-e] will prompt for info which is then stored into the knowhow
database. When the -e option is given the $EDITOR is used to enter
the information.
.sp
kbc <query> will give count of items from knowhow database which
are specified by the <query> (see below).
.sp
kbk <query> will print out the keys of the items from the knowhow database
which are specified by the <query>. (See below).
.sp
kbq <query> will print all items from the knowhow database which 
are specified by the <query> (see below).
.sp
kbu <query> will present all items which are specified by <query> (see below)
to the editor one by one. After the edit session the items are updated in the
knowhow database.
.SH QUERY
The <query> can be described in BNF as follows:
.nf
<query> ::= <term> { OR <term> }*

<term> ::= <factor> { AND <factor> }*

<factor> ::=   <key>
                | NOT <factor>
