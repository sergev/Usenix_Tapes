This is a correction of my last posting RE: linking kbq and kba in the kb
Makefile.  I was wrong. When I tried it I got a usage for qba but it doesn't
behave correctly.  Sorry for the dis-information.

If there is a file kba.c I would like a copy of it as well.  

I ran the program and it looks very useful.  It's like a grep that will
retrieve the entire file for each match on the key.

Thanks in advance.
