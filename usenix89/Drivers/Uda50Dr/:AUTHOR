This is (or, depending on article latency and ordering at your
site, was or will be) a replacement for the 4.3BSD UDA50 driver.

Why you should use this driver:

	It fixes a number of bugs in the existing driver.  Most
	of these show up only when your hardware breaks.

	It decodes errors reasonably well.  Older drivers print
	incomplete and/or incomprehensible data.

Why you should *not* use this driver:

	It has no MicroVAX support.  (There is a problem in the
	crash dump code on uVaxen, and it does not handle RD53s
	and such.  If you add RD disk support, it will work as
	well as the 4.3BSD driver.)

The driver itself is in three separate shell archives.  These should
be run in an empty directory.  Read the file `Installation' for
installation instructions.  There is a replacement manual entry
which describes everything I know about each of the various device
errors that the driver handles.

If you choose to accept this mission ... oops, wrong tape.  If you
run into trouble, or have changes for the driver, send me mail.
