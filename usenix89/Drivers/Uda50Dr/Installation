Installation instructions (such as they are):

1.  Install the `vax' files in /sys/vax.  These are:

	mscp.c		(new)
	mscp.h		(replacement - be sure to keep backups!)
	mscpvar.h	(new)

2.  Install the `vaxuba' files in /sys/vaxuba.  These are:

	uba.c.diff	(patch)
	ubavar.h.diff	(patch)
	uda.c		(replacement)
	udareg.h	(replacement)

    You can use the `patch' program (in /usr/new) to apply the patches.

3.  Install the `vaxif' file in /sys/vaxif:

	if_ec.c.diff	(patch)

4.  Edit /sys/conf/files.vax: add the line

	vax/mscp.c	optional genmscp

    (in alphabetical order if you like to preseve such things).

5.  Edit your configuration file (/sys/conf/PICKLE or whatnot): add the line

	pseudo-device	genmscp

    You should also add the same line to the LINT configuration file,
    if you run lint on your kernel code.

6.  Configure a new kernel (see `Installing and Operating 4.3BSD' in the
    System Manager's Manual).

	/etc/config PICKLE	# or whatever
	cd ../PICKLE		# or whatever
	make depend
	make

    This will take some time.

7.  Put the new kernel in /, and try booting it.  If it works, cheer.
    Put the new manual entry in /usr/man/man4/uda.4, and the standalone
    uda.c in /sys/stand/uda.c.
