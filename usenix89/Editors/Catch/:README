Here is a simple-minded utility to delete specified characters from
files or from stdin.  I found it necessary for all kinds of
reformatting, and tr -d doesn't always do the job -- for example, if you
need to remove newlines from an Epson graphics file (which I had to do
today), tr removes all the nulls as well, which trashes the file.

catch offers several options for designating characters -- octal, hex,
decimal, character, and several abbreviations.  catch -h lists them all.

To compile, you need getopt(3).  I also use efopen and efclose -- if you
don't have these, use fopen and fclose.  The errors() call is often
called error(), but you can always do your own.
