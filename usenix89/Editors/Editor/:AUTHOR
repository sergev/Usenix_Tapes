The following *very* simple program is a simple front end to programs
that invoke editors all over the place.  It's very fast and for probably
99% of what people use editors for, sufficiently powerful.

The main idea is to use this from within programs like PicoSpan and
various mail programs.  Again, speed is of the essence.

The program has been tested on BSD and System V machines, and, no
great suprise, works fine on both of them.  If you're on a BSD
machine you should compile it with the "-DBSD" option to have it
act friendly about job control interruptions.

	Feedback to me or to net.sources.d
