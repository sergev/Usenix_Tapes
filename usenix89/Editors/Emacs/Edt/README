This distribution is in three parts:
     1. .emacs_pro
        edt-help
        time.ml
     2. edt-sup  this is the basic guts of the thing
     3. help-**  all the individual help screens


This emacs_pro can be used as an example.  just insert the proper lines
into yours.

Create your own directory /lib or whatever to stick the edt-sup and help
files.  You may need to go into edt-sup and search for all "read-file"
occurences and insert the proper path in front of the file names.  The
same is true for the "load"'s in .emacs_pro.

Some of the code may appear crude but it does work.  It is a pretty close
emulation of DEC's EDT including the help screens.  The keypad is identical
with few exceptions.  

One note:  in EDT you end the find argument by hitting either 4 or 5 to 
let it know which direction to search.  Here, you need to have selected
the direction first and then hit Gold Find, enter the string and terminate
it by pressing return, not enter.  Sorry bout that but that's the way it
works.

Insert disclaimers here.  DEC is registered to Digital Equipment Corp. 
 etc.

Look over edt-sup and it will give you an idea of what it does.
