	Repeat    This key is used when you want to repeat a command
		  without pressing that key repeatedly.  Press this
		  key, type in the number of repetitions, press return,
		  and press the key corresponding to the command you 
		  wish.

	COMMAND   This key will allow you to type in any Emacs command.
                  You will receive the : prompt on the bottom line.
                  You may then enter any valid emacs command.  Commands
                  are parsed using a Twenex style command interpreter --
                  you can press ESC or space to invoke command completion,
                  or "?" for help with what you're allowed to type at that
                  point.  Note: This will not work if it's asking for a key
                  or macro name.


To return to the keypad diagram, press the Help key (PF2).
For help on another keypad key, press that key.
