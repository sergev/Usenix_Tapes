	SUBS   deletes the search string and replaces it with the 
               contents of the paste buffer.  It then searches for 
               the next occurence of that search string.  This will 
               occur in either the forward or backup direction.
               Each time you press the SUBS key, it will substitute 
               and move to the next occurence of the search string.
