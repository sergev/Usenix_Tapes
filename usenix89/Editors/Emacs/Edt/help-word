	Word moves the cursor to the next word in either the advance or
	    backup direction.

	CHNGCASE works in two ways:
        If no range is selected, it will change the case of the 
            current character in the advance direction and of the 
            previous character in the backup direction.  The cursor 
            will also advance to the next character.
        If a range is selected, it will change the case of all 
            characters within that range and leave the cursor in
            it's present location.
