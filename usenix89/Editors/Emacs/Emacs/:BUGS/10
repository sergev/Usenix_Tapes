Rats!  Two problems I've found with this since posting it:

   1) Somehow, in editing the posting, I added an extra parenthesis in
      the second-to-last line.

   2) While this works much better than the original, it still breaks
      the last word on the line is delimited by other than a space.
      If you type, for example "(stuff<space>" beyond the foll column,
      the parethesis will be deleted.  I haven't fixed this, yet.
