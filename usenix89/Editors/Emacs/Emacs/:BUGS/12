  I would like to get changes for microEMACS v3.7 which would incorporate
the following from a previous posting, since they are handy for unix
systems used telephone lines.
  I don't have any uucp mail address
or other way to contact Walter Bright or Bjorn Benson.

>	3) Use scrolling region capability of most terminals. This results

>	4) Easy way to support special keys that send escape sequences.

>	   only results in a 1 line scroll, not half a screen.

Thanks.  Jack.
