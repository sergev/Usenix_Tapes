It should not be necessary to send SIGTSTP to your process group
after catching one.  (Note the word *should*.)  This is because
everyone in your process group should have received the same keyboard
signal already.  Each should handle the TSTP, then stop itself.

Note that there is a timing problem here as well, at least among
programs that alter and then restore the tty state.  For example,
suppose you run a program that sets the terminal to cbreak mode,
then that program runs another that sets the terminal to nl mode
(CR/LF mapping turned off).  Now you type ^Z.  Which program runs
first?  If it is the cbreak'er that runs first, it will restore
the mode properly, then stop; then the nl'er will run, and `restore'
the mode to cbreak.

Oops.

(There are many solutions, but I am not up to listing them now.)
