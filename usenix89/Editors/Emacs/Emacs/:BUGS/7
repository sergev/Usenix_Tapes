	The above mentioned are NOT any specific BSD -calls.

	You can fix this by adding input.c to your Makefile.
	It seemed to be missing from there, and all the functions
	above are in input.c .


	Then an other thing :

		I am currently using IBM PC/AT with MicroPort's
		UNIX System V release 2.

		I did compile uEmacs allright. But it seems that
		the console key mappings don't work. All I can
		get out of the arrow-keys is h's l's j's and k's
		as if the console was ment to be used ONLY with vi !!

		The keyset command does not allow the keypad keys
		to be configured again.

		Does anyone happen to know how to make uEmacs work
		right in this case ???
