	Boy, I never seem to have write access to the right newsgroup
at the right time......

	This is a bug fix for MicroEMACS 3.5 (which appeared in net.sources)
MicroEMACS 3.6 (which is now coming out in mod.sources) and MicroEMACS 3.6f
(which is the current version which several people have gotten directly).

	in FILE.C, in the function getfile(), the third line of code is
a conditional which looks like:

		if (--curpb->b_nwnd == 0) {

	it and the code it encloses duplicated some code in the function
swbuffer() which is called immediatly below. Delete the conditional and the
four assignment statements it encloses. This will eliminate some rather
confusing cases where you have used the find-file command and end up
with the wrong file displayed until you hit a begining or end-of-buffer.

	Thanx to Mitch McLain for reporting the bug. Of course, this
will have been fixed when 3.7 comes out (late june/early july I think)
