Yet more bugs to fix, this bug exists only in version 3.6f which
I only distributed via mail to the people who have sent me disks.

In the new display driver in display.c, in the function updpos(), there
is a line reading:


	/* if extended, flag so and update the virtual image display */
	if (curcol > term.t_ncol) {
		.
		.

Change this if statement to read:

	if (curcol >= term.t_ncol - 1) {

	this will eliminate an annoying but harmless one char sychronization
problem when wrapping past column 80.

	Again, I am fully intending on continuing to support this version
and if you would like to get it directly, send two (2) DSDD diskettes in
a self addressed, stamped mailer to:

	Daniel Lawrence
	617 New York St
	Lafayette, IN 47901

	I will try to turn around all requests within 2-3 weeks with the
most current version. For those of you with net access, MicroEMACS 3.6 is
just coming out of mod.sources now.
