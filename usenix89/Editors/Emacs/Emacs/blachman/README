There is a MicroEmacs command summary in

	Command.me	fits on two pages 

	Cmds.narrow	for those who can only print 80 characters or less
			per line.
                                                                                    
Please send comments and suggestions to nancy@riacs or amdcad!riacs!nancy.

Thanks,

Nancy Blachman
