Quite some time ago I sent a message to net.emacs that I had an extensive
TeX/LaTex/BibTeX support package that ran under Goslings Emacs-264.
Here it is. 

First there are 3 mlisp files:  TeX-mode.ml, TeX-justify.ml, and
bibTeX.ml.  The bibTeX system requires that you install somewhere
a directory, which I have called "bibshells" that contians a whole
collection of files telling bibTeX how to make article,
techreport, etc., entries.  The 4th big chunk of this file is that
directory, collected together in "ar" format.  The installer must
create this directory, cd to it, and use "ar x" to decompose the
4th portion of this file into the things that go into bibshells.
(Or just do it with an editor.  It's not that big.)  Then s/he
must find the first few lines of bibTeX.ml right after the opening
comments and change them according to where the bibshells
directory is created.

The beginning of each .ml file contains instructions for how to
use the stuff implemented in it.  

Long rows of ===== separate the portions of this message.
