This is the best response I got from the net for a checkbook accounting
program.  Thanks for all of the various submissions (3!).
I have put my complete checkbook account on it and found
a couple of bank errors (they soon fixed their problems).  This works
good as a double balance system as it gives you the bank balance as
well as your own, account information (ie. gas, utils, rent, etc.),
and and itemized listing that keeps a running total like your check
register.  Four cheers for PC Research!

Granted it's written in 'awk' and not C but I am going to
port it as soon as I can.  (I also might make s curses based user
interface to input transaction data.)  Also note that it is share-ware.
I sent in my $10 (it's in the mail, honest!).

BTW, I am quoting the following paragraph second-hand.  Please
send flames to author of the next paragraph (PC Research, Inc.)!
