Are you
	- earning interest daily or quarterly in your favorite bank
	  because of one deposit or regular deposits?
	- planning to save up for your children's education?
	- buying US Savings bonds from your employer?

If so, this programs for YOU.  It will help you answer
how much money it will be worth after a period of time.

Just extract it, compile it, and run it.  All questions are
self-explanatory.  There is also a man/help file in case you get
a bit more inquisitive.

-enjoy,
