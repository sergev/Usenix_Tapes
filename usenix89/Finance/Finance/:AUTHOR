Here is a routine I use on my BBS to calculate amounts for Savings,
accounts and installment & amoritized loans. It presents the data and
will either remove the file or mail the result to the user. Unless there
are 'flavors' of awk that I'm not acquainted with, this should run on
just about any system..... The pager used is 'more', you might want to
replace it with 'pg' or whatever pager you use. The script is Bourne.

Edit this file and name it "finance", do a chmod a+x and run it.
Enjoy...
