-- interest --

This program calculates interest for tax purposes owed or due to the
IRS. For better or worse, the IRS Interest Rate Tables are built in
to the program, so they'll have to be changed whenever the interest
rates change. Rate changes can not occur less than six months apart.

This is my first attempt at a "real" practical program in C. Certain
protions may have been handled differently, but the program was
written around specific user requests -- hence the keyboard input
instead of command line options.

The program has been tested against IRS examples, third party
explainations and real-life. It's worst case so far has been off by
$ .02 on over 2.5 million dollars -- still passable on audit!

All told, the program works, and saves hours of some poor soul pouring
over dozens interest rate tables trying to figure out how many days
there are between periods.
