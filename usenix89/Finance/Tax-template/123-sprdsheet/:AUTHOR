This is a uuencoded version of an arc'd Federal Tax 1986
spreadsheet for Lotus 1-2-3 version 2.  Most common forms
are included, 1040,A,B,C,D,E,G,W,2106,2441,4562.  The
2106 is probably not correct since the local library hasn't
received this year's version.  It is included so someone
else can modify it.

Of course, NO WARRANTY IS MADE AS TO THE ACCURACY AND
RELIABILITY OF THESE FORMS OR WHETHER THEY WOULD BE
ACCEPTED BY THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE..
