This is a 1040 template (1986 Federal taxes) for the SC spreadsheet
posted recently.  It is quite basic: has the 1040, schedule A,
and schedule W.  No tax tables or any cleverness, but it may
be a starting point for others.

I used this for my taxes, but there are no guarantees of
correctness - use at your own risk, etc..  Cut at the line
below and feed this to the sc spreadsheet program.
