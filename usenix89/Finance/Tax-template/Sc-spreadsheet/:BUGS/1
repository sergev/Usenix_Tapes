I copied the sources to SC 3.1 recently and built it on our Ultrix systems.
It compiled without a hitch, but when I ran it, I got an interesting error.
The column numbers ran in reverse vidoe diagonally across the screen from
the upper left corner.  When they reached the right side of the screen,
they wrapped around and continued going diagonally.  Does anyone know where
the display code is so that I can start to track it down?  Or better (for
me), does anyone have a fix already?  I am running Ultrix 32-w if that
maeks any difference.
