Gee, I thought it was just me.  The problem is that 'curses' is not prepared
to handle the "delay" count field of such term strings as SO and SE, so it
just sends them to the terminal, thus getting the columns screwed up.  I
don't have the source to 'curses', so I hacked the following changes
into main:

	if (SO) {while (isdigit(*SO)) SO++;}
	etc. for other strings.

'isdigit' is in <ctype.h>
