Hello,
  I have discovered a possible bug in atc.  When redrawing
the screen, it seems that the process is a forked process.
This screws up the screen when using 1200 baud.  Everytime
I try to redraw the screen, in the middle of the re-draw,
it tries to update the positions of the planes, and then it
quits re-drawing the screen, EVEN IF IT DIDN'T FINISH!!!!
This is a major pain, seeing as how I am VERY HOOKED on this
game.  If anyone has found this problem and fixed it I would
greatly apreciate the fixes.  Please, someone fix this so
I can play the game at home!!!
