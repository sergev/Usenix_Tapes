In the function noise() in input.c, I put a literal ^G (like an idiot).
Shar barfs on this, but don't panic.  Just substitute your favorite
noise character '\007' in the putchar in noise(). 

noise()
{
	putchar('\007');
	fflush(stdout);
}
/* in future versions, this function will have moved to graphics_curses.c */

Thanks to the many people who pointed this out to me.  And thanks to
the many people who will still point this out to me bacause they will
get this article in two weeks.  :-)  --ed

ps.  Why is there no net.sources.games.bugs?
