On 4.3, this can be found in /usr/include/sys/signal.h:

	#define sigmask(m)	(1 << ((m)-1))

On 4.2, and early 4.3 BSD systems, this will not be defined.  It might
be in the man signal page, but they expected you to define it yourself.

In any event, if you get a 'undefined: _sigmask' error compiling 
ATC, just put this macro in update.c (I think).  Yes, sigsetmask does
a similar function, but I bet that's undefined in early 4.2 systems
as well.
