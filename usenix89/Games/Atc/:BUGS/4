there is a little feature of the installation procedure for this game that
people should perhaps be aware of. if like me, you don't pay strict attention
to the error messages from make, you can land in deep shit. the problem is
with the lines executed by going "make install". to whit:

	(cd dist; make)
	mkdir `dist/atc -p`
	cp games/* `dist/atc -p`
	chmod 644 `dist/atc -p`/*
	chmod 755 `dist/atc -p`
	chown -f root `dist/atc -p`/* `dist/atc -p`
	(cd dist; install -o root -m 4755 atc /usr/games)

if dist/atc does not exist, or is not executable then what you end up with is:

	chmod 644 /*
	chown -f root /*

suddenly, nobody can log in, except root, because /bin etc are not searchable.
just thought i'd let people know. i know, because it just bit me in the bum.
