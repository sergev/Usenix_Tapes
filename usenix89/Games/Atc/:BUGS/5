Just when you thought it was safe to play ATC...

I found a bug in the linked list handling supplied by Mark VandeWettering,
which sometimes causes a plane waiting for departure to "crash on the ground".
The fix is a one-line addition to list.c as follows:

line:
 48			l->tail->next = p;
 49			p->next = NULL;		/* this line is new! */
 50			p->prev = l->tail;
 51			l->tail = p;


Given the number of fixes and enhancements that have come down the
pike lately, someone should probably re-post the whole mess in about
2 weeks.  Since Ed James wrote the game, I will give him first dibs
at maintaining the source.
