The ATC source I posted on Friday assumed that kernel file locking
was available.  While this is true of System V Release 2 systems
from AT&T, it is not included in all versions of System V.

To get around the problem, I've introduced another compile option in
the top level Makefile.  If you have /usr/group standard record and
file locking (check for the presence of /usr/include/unistd.h),
leave the makefile as is.  Otherwise, comment out the line that
says "UNISTD = -DUNISTD".

The new locking scheme is based on exclusive creation of a
temporary file.  It's hardly bullet-proof, but it should suffice
in a friendly environment.  Anybody who wants to beef it up
should feel free to do so.

Five files are affected by this change:  Makefile, src/Makefile,
src/include.h, src/log.c, and src/graphics.c.  Vanilla diff's appear
below.  Sorry for the inconvenience.
