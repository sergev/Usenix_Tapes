I think all of these ideas are good.
Two things that I have put in:
	1) beep when new planes arrive (useful @ 1200bps when the going's slow)
	2) turn towards
		a) airport #
		b) destination (automatically figures airport/exit #)

More ideas:
	1) about suspending/escaping, how about a cmd line flag?
	2) at cmds stack up (i.e. turn to 90 @ b0 [90 from b0 heads to b3],
				45 @ b3)
	3) compute towards cmds when executed for @ cmds (i.e. if e2
		is 45 from current position, but 90 from b0 & we say
		"turn towards exit #2 at beacon #0", it turns 90, not 45).


	I hope this new release gets out ASAP.
    There are much too many mods coming off the net for me
    to keep it straight.
