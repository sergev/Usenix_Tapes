No, but you don't run a system with the "curses/terminfo" package, written
by Mark Horton as a replacement for "curses" and "termcap", and provided
with System V Release 2.  With a little work, that package does run under
4.2BSD (it's an old version of "curses"/"terminfo" and hadn't been tested on
4.2BSD yet); the one thing I remember is that you have to change the SIGTSTP
handler to reset the signal handler for SIGTSTP to SIG_DFL before it sends
itself a SIGTSTP, or you find yourself in an infinite loop of screen
repainting.

Of course, the game was probably written for S5R2, so you may get caught by
the infamous index/strchr change, or the tty driver differences; as a wise
man once said (in the source code of "ex"), "It's so wonderful how we all
speak the same language..."
