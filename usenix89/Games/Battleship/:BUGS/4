	Included is the trivial patch to make the damn thing work under 4.2.
    Also, probably, 4.1, and Lord knows what else.  No shell archive; you'll
    have to use an editor (it isn't worth the time to write one).  The lines
    flagged by ']' are added; the rest is for context.

    Don't forget to compile as "cc bs.c -o bs -lcurses -ltermlib"!

    Gripes/flames to /dev/null; it's a stupid game, anyway (:-)
