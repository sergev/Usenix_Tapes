     Well, I  was inspired by cad@cbosgd's posting of (a revised version
of) Bruce Holloway's battleship game.   I unpacked it and  felt  that it
could  use  some  improvement, but  didn't feel up to  understanding the
code.  Instead, I rewrote it.  The user interface is nicer, the computer
player is nasty, and  it keeps a global score file.  The only machine  I
know this runs on is ours (VAX11/750, 4.2bsd UNIX), but it should run on
any 4.[23]bsd (or bsd-derived, such as Sun)  machine.   It uses flock(),
so it won't run on some systems out there.  Anyway, here it is.

     Here is what wc should give on the .c file:

	    1073    2929   20792 main.c
