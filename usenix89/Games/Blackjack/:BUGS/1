Summary: forgot option to bj [hostname]
Posted: Thu Jun 26 01:08:20 1986

Ooops.  I forgot to to put in the man page the option [hostname]
to bj.  It isn't much of a network game if it only runs on one machine,
right.  So if the dealer isn't running on the same machine you are on,
type "bj hostname", where hostname is the name of the machine running
the dealer server.  

Also, much to my suprise, I saw inverse video on the display when playing
on my vt100 upstairs.  I wrote the game on a Televideo 925 I have
downstairs, so I forgot I put the standout() stuff in bj, since the
Televideo doesn't do anything with it.  I have modified the game so the
inverse bar moves around the screen with the current player, and also
added statistics for the average value of the dealer's hand.  The diffs
are 617 lines, so if there is any interest, I'll just post the whole
darn thing again.  Sorry about that folks.
