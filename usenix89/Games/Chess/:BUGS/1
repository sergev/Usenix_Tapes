	I received a copy of chess from Doug Scofea (djs@cblpe.ATT.COM)
just yesterday. Thanks to everyone who offered. There seems to be some
funny problem there though. If after compiling chess if I tried to
to execute it from some another directory it gives Bus error and core dumps
while if ran from the same dir it runs ok. (this is on both UTS and sysV),
Did someone have a similar problem?
