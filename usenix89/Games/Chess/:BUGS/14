The following diffs correct the above-reported difficulty.  Memset
seems to be some sort of specialized function to set memory to 
arbitrary values, in this case zero. The workaround seems to be a
simple "for-loop" to zero out the memory.

By the way, this program seems to be a fairly competent chess player.
