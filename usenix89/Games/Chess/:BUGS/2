On a SUN 3-50 I had problems with a core dump (illegal instruction) if
the program is run from any tty other than the console.  The catch was
that one of the low level routines invoked by 'initscr()' uses an
array named 'index' as a jump table.  This jump table is not used if
the output device is the console.  Since 'chess.c' also uses an array
named 'index', the loader just uses that one and you end up jumping 
into a random location.  A simple fix is to do a global replace on
the source changing 'index' to 'indexx'.
