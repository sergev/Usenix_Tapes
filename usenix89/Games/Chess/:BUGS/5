I'm having trouble with the C source for chess written by John Stanback 
(hplabs!hpfcla!hpisla!hpltca!jhs).  I'm on a VAX running VMS V4.4.  The 
program compiles without errors, but when I try to link, I get an undefined 
symbol "memset".  Examination of the source reveals that memset is a function 
called twice in the source, but it is never defined anywhere.  Was the 
definition left out, or is there no way to run this code on a VAX?

Thanks,
