The program itself has no problem castling when it wants to.  However,
when I want to castle I have no luck.  Has anybody else had this problem?
Also, how does one go about changing the program from accepting a Ctrl-J
to indicate end of input to a CR?  I am running Xenix V Rel 2.1.3 on a
Compaq Deskpro.  My hat is off to the writer of this otherwise excellent
program.  Thanks in advance for any help.
