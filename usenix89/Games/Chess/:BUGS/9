Recently jhs@hpltca.HP.COM (John Stanback) posted a chess program
to net.sources.games.  Unfortunately there is a nasty bug in it.
On line 45 (or so) he declares "short index[64]".  But "index" is
also a BSD library call.  Under certain circumstances (I noticed
this when my tty was pseudo-tty: under suntools and under UW)
curses will call index, unsuccessfully.  The fix is to add
#define index Index
somewhere at the start of all the other defines.
