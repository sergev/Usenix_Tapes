	Indeed, they are the same. I had heard about someone doing
	a C conversion in Caltech, but could not really find out that
	it was you. You would indeed same me some work, and probably
	make eveyone on the net very happy.

	I would appreciate if you could forward them to me, for
	packaging with what I have, and I will send it to mod.sources
	moderator. He is expecting it :-)

	The Pascal sources, and its C derivative, in accordance with
	the copyright laws, will contain copyright date, and the
	names of its authors, and a note specifiying that the sources
	may only be used for non-commercial purposes.
