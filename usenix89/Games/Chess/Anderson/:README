This is a five-part distribution of "nchess", a network chess game I wrote
a few months ago during a chess fad at work.  It runs on Sun Microsystems'
workstations, and would be quite difficult to port to other machines due
to heavy reliance on Sun's window libraries.  It bears no relation to the
existing chesstool program; i.e., it was written from scratch without any
knowledge of how chesstool is implemented (since we don't have the source).

Since the manual page is included in the following shell archives, no more
need be said.  Please mail any comments, bugs, etc. directly to me, since
I very rarely read net news.

Any commercial use of this software is strictly prohibited, INCLUDING usage
as a demo vehicle for Sun workstations.

Enjoy!
