			Some Notes on Installing Craps

	Craps is known to run on BSD2.x and BSD4.x.  If you are running
	on another UN*X operating system, then is is imperative that
	you have a curses library, or forget using this program.
	Also, for other systems, the file random.c will have to be
	modified for your local random number generator.

	The routine seedrand() seeds the random number generator, and
	get_rand() returns an random integer between 1 and 6.

	The high roller list uses the system library function qsort(3),
	so if your system doesn't have it, it must be supplied, or, as an
	alternative, just comment out the "#define SCORES" from the file
	"types.h"

	Also, you will have to specify the path for the high roller
	file, "craps_list", if the define "#define SCORES" is present.
	It should go in /usr/games/lib.  The name of the directory
	is in the file "final.c"
