A couple of things I have run into.

1)
The paramter AREA to the function SET is declared as a Character but
pass in from gen as an integer.  This caused a problem with
my fortran compiler (AREA was always zero).  A fix for this
is to declare it as an INTEGER in SET and then convert it to a character
when you need to use it with the CHAR function in fortran.

2)
This program was written for BSD4.2 UNIX not ATT Unix.  For ATT Unix, one
change that you will have to make is the call to select in delay.
