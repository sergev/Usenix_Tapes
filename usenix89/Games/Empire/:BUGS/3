Sorry for the confusion about VMS Empire.  The game was originally
written for VMS, but the version I posted has been hacked to work
under 4BSD UNIX for Vaxes.  It is a human-vs-computer game released
through DECUS.

I call it VMS Empire to distinguish it from PSL Empire.  The version 
I posted is not for VMS.  I will post the VMS version as soon as I
figure out how to get our VMS machine to spit it's files onto 
a UNIX box.

I hate DecNet.

ps:  Sorry to post a non-source thing to net.sources.  This doesn't
	mean I am net brain-dead.  I just wanted to reach all you 
	folks who read net.source.games and not rec.games.empire.
	Please don't fill up my mailbox with net.usage docs! :-)
	Post rebuttals to rec.games.empire, not net.sources.
