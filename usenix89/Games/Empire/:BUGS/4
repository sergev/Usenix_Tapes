Great game.  I used to play it all the time on Data General machines.

I couldn't get it to work on Suns though.  It was very poorly written and had
many hardware dependencies.  In particular, it would often put a value between
0-255 in an integer*4 and pass it to a subroutine that expected character*1.
This means it only works on machines that address bytes within a word from low
to high and which pass character variables by single address (i.e. only Dec).

There were also problems with curses and I finally gave up.

I realize this isn't Ed James' fault, but does anyone have a version that works
on a better variety of hardware?
