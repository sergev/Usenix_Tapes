One problem with Empire on a Sun3 starts with the fact that 

    In the function SET(),  FORTRAN expects a character, but GEN passes
	an integer.  This works on a VAX, because the lowest byte is
	the least significant.  But the sun sees an integer 33 as a
	null-byte, and confuses set.

 I fixed this problem by changing the  AREA parameter to SET to
    iiAREA, (allowing the CHARACTER AREA declaration to serve to
	declare a local variable), then tossing in a simple
	    area = char(iiarea)
	to initialize the local CHAR to the given INTEGER.

But Empire still crashes after you make a move (segmentation violation).
I suspect more CHARACTER hackery.
