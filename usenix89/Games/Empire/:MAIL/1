I have a shell script (about 22 Kbytes) that converts Old Empire
Version 1.1 to Version 1.2.  Before I post it to the net,
I would like to have a couple friendly users try it.  It seems
to work OK here, but one never knows how different systems will
behave.

The shell program consists of editor (ed) scripts to modify around
40 files.

Version 1.2 has several 1.1 bugs fixed, including the infamous
"rolling civilians" bug.

If you have an unmodified Version 1.1 stashed somewhere, and you
would be willing to convert it to 1.2 and verify it, please let me
know.
