Here is a Microsoft Mouse Program to drive hack. Of course this
will only work if you have an MS mouse... I use it to play 
PC-Hack 3.5, but if you dial-up from your pc, you can use it
to play any 1.0.3 hack...

Hopefully it will also serve as a simple Mouse program example
for those interested.
(I remember at least one request for MS mouse programs...)

Briefly, to make this work: do the following:

Install your mouse driver
Save it in a file called hack.def
Execute makemenu  "C> makemenu"
Tell makemenu the definition file is called hack.
Type: "C> menu hack"

Enjoy,

Greg
