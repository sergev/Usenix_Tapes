I'm not sure which newsgroup this more properly belongs  in,  and 
we don't get net.jokes here, so please don't flame me :-)
 
The jargon file,  recently posted to net.sources and mod.sources, 
is interesting, and a lot of us commonly use many of those terms. 
But they're all from "the old days". Many of us come from entire-
ly different backgrounds,  and have our own set of jargon that is 
also  in common usage.  These are often derived from hardware and 
assembly language terms on micros,  where things are quite a  bit 
different  from old PDP's and LISP processors.  I didn't see  one 
single reference to UN*X in the jargon file, and it's been around 
plenty long enough to have spawned quite a few slang terms of its 
own.
 
Here are some of the terms I use. If people will send me their own
versions,  I  will summarize and post a jargon file update to the 
net.
 
TRISTATE
  As in:  "Shall we go to the movies, or go out to eat?" "Idunno, 
  you  decide." The second person is tristating,  or in  tristate 
  mode.
 
INTERRUPT
  What you say to change the subject briefly.
 
POPPING THE STACK
  Return  from  interrupt.  "Popping the stack,  you were  saying 
  that..."
 
MULTI-TASKING
  What you're doing when you're talking on the phone while  edit-
  ing a program,  and,  at the same time,  trying to discuss with 
  your wife what you want for dinner.
 
STACK OVERFLOW
  What  happens  when you're multi-tasking and a rug  rat  starts 
  pulling on your pants leg, demanding your attention.
 
DROPPING BITS
  What  causes  you to forget something you ought to be  able  to 
  remember. Analogous to mental bit rot.
 
LDIR
  Load-increment-and-repeat.  Same as BLT, or 'blit'. From Z80, a 
  memory move instruction.
