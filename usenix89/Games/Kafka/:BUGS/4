I guess I need to clarify. I'm not dumb. I figured that random()
returns a random number. Is the returned number between 0 - 1, 0 -
2, 1 - 10, 0 - .5, ... This funtion is not in my System V manual.

(I did get a reply. Someone understood my question. It returns the
same as rand())

You could make a flea lick a slippery squid. Go out and meet a nice
gloop and eat a gerbil! Make the world a better place and make a fish
get plague.
