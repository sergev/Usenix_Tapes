A while back, good@pixar posted a program called ``ncode'', and
then someone else (don't have the original any more) posted a
database which generates National Enquirer headlines.  I've modified
it quite a bit, and thought someone out there might enjoy the result.
Of course, this won't do you much good unless you've got ``ncode''
already.
