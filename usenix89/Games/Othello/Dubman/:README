Here is a complete, working Othello game in C (also known as Reversi) with
N-move lookahead.  It is about 1300 lines and about 38K long.  I'm not a unix
wizard and I don't know how to use makefiles and stuff so I am just putting the
whole thing in one file.  I hope this doesn't upset anyone with a small buffer.
But even my Apple II has a 26K buffer, so anyone with a computer big enough to
compile this should have no trouble.  Copy it, change it, whatever; just don't
sell it or remove my name from it.
