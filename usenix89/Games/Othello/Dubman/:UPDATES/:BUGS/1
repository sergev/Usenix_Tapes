OOOPS.  There's a small change you should make to the othello graphics tool
I posted earlier:

There are two lines about 191 lines into otool.c that look like:

	CANVAS_AUTO_EXPAND, FALSE,
	CANVAS_AUTO_SHRINK, FALSE,

Just delete them, they have an adverse affect on the way things are
drawn.


Also, I've found a bug in the original program: boards larger than 8x8 don't
work right.
