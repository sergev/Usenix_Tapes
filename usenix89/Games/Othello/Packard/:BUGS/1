	In the recent Othello game that was posted there is one
major problem.
	Originally the board is formed of chars. To distinguish
pieces, squares are set to 1 for white, -1 for black. The problem
is that a char can't hold -1. (Sometimes they can, it depends how
your machine handles sign extension) To be technically correct,
change line 9 of reversi.h to:

typedef int	boardT[SIZE+2][SIZE+2];

	There are also some char-to-int changes to be made in move.c
and score.c. In several functions there are some register chars defined.
Make them register ints.
