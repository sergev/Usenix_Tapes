There are some assumptions your code makes about the target machine,
in particular in the use of 'char' variables.  On many targets, a
char is never negative!  In your program, the board is stored as a
char array, and so far this is the only problem i noticed.  

The easiest solution was to add this line to reversi.h:
	typdef short int	boardE;
The diff listings of the affected files follows:

***** diff between gencor.c.BAK and gencor.c
5c5
< char	board[9];
---
> boardE	board[9];
***** diff between genedge.c.BAK and genedge.c
5c5
< char	board[9];
---
> boardE	board[9];
***** diff between legal.c.BAK and legal.c

< 	register char	*b, *m;
---
> 	register boardE	*b, *m;
***** diff between move.c.BAK and move.c
