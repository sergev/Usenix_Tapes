This is the source to an othello program I wrote completely from
scratch.  Do what you will to the source but, if you mangle it
don't expect me to fix it...

As usual, bug fixes will be most gratefully accepted.  If you
care to figure out how the edgescore array is generated you can
probably improve the play considerably by mucking about with the
generating yacc program makeedge.y. 

This was developed on my pdp 11/73 running 2.9BSD unix.
I do nothing weird to either the screen or to signals; it
*should* run without major modifications on sys5, sys3 and,
gasp, even version 7.  It ran at one time on 4.2BSD and I
haven't made substantial changes since then so, who knows, it
may run there with no modifications!
