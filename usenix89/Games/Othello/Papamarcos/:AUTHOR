This is another Othello (reversi) program.  It works, is documented, and
is extremely portable.  What more could you ask?  Now of course it ain't
pretty, has a primitive user interface (row-column as two-digit number,
88 means start automatic play and 99 means suggest a move), and employs
a recursive alpha-beta search algorithm, but to each his own :-).  I wrote
it about 4 years ago, when my C programming ability was in its infancy, so
that's my only excuse.  Do enjoy, and keep me informed by e-mail of any
deficiencies or enhancements.
