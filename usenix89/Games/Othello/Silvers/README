This is a version of othello that I wrote this year as a freshman computing
II project.  It requires a ReGIS compatible terminal to run.  I have never
used Modula 2 on another system, so I hope all of the libraries are there
for you.  The only one you may need in the one in regis.mod that prints
out an escape character.  If you don't have it, you can probably write it.
The computer plays the person with one move of look ahead.  It is a respectable
player and moves extreamly fast.

I would appreatiate any comments, suggestions on this program, but don't
wait for a reply because I am on summer vacation and won't be on the net
much.  Feel free to modify this program as you wish.  As long as no money
is made off of it, I do not care.  Sorry for the lack of documentation
with it, but I leave here tomorrow and I do not have time to write any.
			Have fun, 
				Rob.
