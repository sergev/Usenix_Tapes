Thanks, it was desperately needed.

Lets here about these bugs, cos I want to fix them.

Harder should be just the pacman moving slower and the bugs moving faster.

The fact that the "left" arrow doesn't work unless you hit it at the precise
moment was documented in the Notes file under point (6). It is due to
characters getting lost over the socket between the parent and the slave
processes. I have looked at this a lot and it is going to require a better
person than me to fix it.

I too have noticed this and believe it is a function of the underlying Sun
graphics software. I am welcome to be proved wrong.
