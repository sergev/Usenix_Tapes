  argv@sri-spam.arpa sent me some mail on problems he's noticed on trying to
get SidTool (pacman) working on his Sun3. Has anybody else noticed these?

  John P. Nelson pointed out that he had to run "setkeys sun3" before it would
work properly on his machine. Does that fix these problems?

  If anybody has got any ideas, please let me know.

  The problems were:

(1) When sitting in demo mode, it goes thru a demo game once, displays the
    directions and the high scores, then, upon second "loop" of this, it
    doesn't demo anymore, it sits and does nothing.

(2) When playing, I finally manage to finish a screen but it just sat there
    blinking .. no intermission, no new screen nothing.

(3) There's the case of the "items" (like panel items) in which you choose
    play, quit, etc .. well, that menu appears all wrong (overlaps each other,
    missing chunks, etc..) if you play a game, lose (or quit) and try to
    restart a new game.

Regards Rich.
