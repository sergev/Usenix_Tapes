   This program has a byte order dependency problem, that is, it passes
the address of a variable when writing one byte.  The authors machine
presumably has low byte first so it works, but on my 68000 system I was
always writing the high order 0 until I copied the variable to a new char
variable and used its address.  When the output is not going to stdout,
different code is used.
   I apologize for not giving you the file name where the problem exists.
I have it all at home and am describing it from memory, but I hope this
is sufficient to let you find it.
