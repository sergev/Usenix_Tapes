Common problem:  declare the variable that is written by the 'write()' call
to be type 'char' NOT 'int'  on 68000/gould type machines (which arent
backwards like the vax) when you do:
	int c;
	c = 'A';
	write(1, &c, 1);

	You DO NOT get an 'A', you get a '\0' (NULL character)
	On a vax it works due to its peculiar byte ordering.
	Anyway, the fix it make a new var (or change the declaration
	of 'c'.)
	int c;
	char ctmp;
	c = 'A';
	ctmp = c;
	write(1, &ctmp, 1);
	Will work.
	Pm has this bug.
	The reason it only happens on tty's is that the buffering is
	single char for ttys, line or block buffered for other things,
	like redirection and/or pipes.
