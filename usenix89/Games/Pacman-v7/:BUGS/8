I have hacked the latest pm to compile on SVR2; the only failure is
an undefined symbol "ftime" on the load.  I seem to remember that
this was pseudo-device-driver code designed to emulate the BSD nap()
system call via hardware timeouts, but I can't find the source for
it anywhere.

Could some kind soul send me the source for ftime() and maybe some
installation guidelines so I can (hopefully) get pm up and running
for System V?  I will, of course, post it as soon as I am reasonably
confident that it is working correctly.

Thanks very much in advance!
