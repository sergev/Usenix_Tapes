    It turns out that the problem is not so much ordering as it is the use
of the CVT instruction.  By convention, only LONG WORDS are placed on the
stack, so when chars, or shorts are passed to functions, they are first
converted to longs before being placed on the stack.  On the function end,
CVT is again useed to convert (if needed) the long word on the stack to the
type of the argument as specified by the declaration of the parameter.  This
effectively gives you the problems that you find when INTS are passed to CHARS,
or any other combination of different types.
