	Ever so often when I execute phantasia I get the
error for ill_sig():

	Error: caught signal # 10.

This is SIGBUS.  I have no real idea why we're getting this
bus error.  It traces to an fclose in titlestuff().

Further information is: this is compiled BSD41 on an Vax 11/750.
It also is compiled with xstr.

		Help much appreciated since characters are not
		getting saved...
