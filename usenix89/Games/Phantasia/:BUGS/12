Unfortunately this doesn't work if someone else dies  before  you
get  a  chance to delete <null>. If that happens, <null> gets the
characteristics of the last player that dies, but phantasia still
thinks  that the king is someone named <null>, whose characteris-
tics are those of the now defunct king.

My rather drastic solution was to re-create the characs file, and
populate it by hand, using the -x -S options.
