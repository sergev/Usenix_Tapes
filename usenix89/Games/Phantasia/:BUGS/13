<nulls> in Phantasia are saved in kind of a stack.  When somebody dies,
he becomes <null>, and the previous <null> is pushed down in the stack,
so the most recently killed character occupies the top position.  So, in
order to access a <null> that is farther down, all you have to do is use
the wizard switches (-S -x) and change <null>'s name to something else.
Then the previous <null> occupies the top position, and you can change
his name, and so on.  Another way to do this is to try 'phantasia -p'
that should purge all old characters -- including <null>'s on some
versions.  I modified my version so that it can now handle 100+
characters without messing up the character listing (normally the
listing gets to the bottom of the page and freezes there).  That's just
the beginning.  If anybody wants a copy, mail me.
