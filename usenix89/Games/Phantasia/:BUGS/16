Here are a few fixes to the recently posted source to Phantasia 3.3.2.
Thanks to everyone who responded with suggestions.

----------------------
phant.nr:
    Insert first line for 'man(1)':
    '\" t

fight.c:
    Fix 'all or nothing' (approx. line #862):

    /* failure -- monster gets stronger and quicker */
    {
    inflict = 0.0;		/* ADD THIS LINE */

    Curmonster.m_o_strength = Curmonster.m_strength *= 2.0;
    .
    .
    .

convert.c:
    Conversion of character type is incorrect (off by one).
    Change the following lines:

#119:	Newplayer.p_type = Oldplayer.o_type - 20 - 1;

#126:	Newplayer.p_type = Oldplayer.o_type - 10 - 1;

#113:	Newplayer.p_type = Oldplayer.o_type - 1;

phantdefs.h, io.c:
    Some versions of 'curses' don't translate '\r' into '\n'
    when in cbreak() mode.

    In 'phantdefs.h' (approx. line 140):

    #define CH_ERASE	'\010'		/* erase character (ctrl-H) */
    #define CH_NEWLINE	'\n'		/* newline */
    #define CH_RETURN	'\r'		/* return */	/* ADD THIS LINE */

    In 'io.c' (getstring(), approx. line 76):

    case CH_NEWLINE:	/* terminate string */
    case CH_RETURN:	/* ADD THIS LINE */
	ch = CH_NEWLINE;	/* ADD THIS LINE */
	break;

gamesupport.c:
    Changing palantir and blessing are swapped.

    In changestats() (approx. line 410):

	Change

	case '4':	/* change palantir */

	to

	case '5':	/* change palantir */

	Change

	case '5':	/* change blessing */

	to

	case '4':	/* change blessing */

/usr/include/time.h:
    Some systems don't have this header file.  Look at the manual
    page for ctime(3) to see the contents of this file, and make
    your own.

    Some systems may need to add the line:
 
    extern struct tm *localtime();

    to 'phantglobs.h'.  (Other systems already have that line
    in 'time.h'.)
