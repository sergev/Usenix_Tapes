Phantasia is overflowing an array.  It is reading the contents of the
"lastdead" file (in the phantasia lib directory) into the array "aline[80]",
then formats it into the array "instr[80]".  if you read too many characters
from "lastdead", you overflow "instr", and then you get the bus error.

anyway, to get phantasia going again, edit the lastdead file and make
it shorter.  the longterm fix is to change

	fgets(aline,80,fp);
to
	fgets(aline,80-strlen("The last character to die is "), fp);

or something like that.
