I have been having alot of problems with the sscanf statement
in the callmonster routine in func0.c
The problem appears in the form of a segmentation fault or
bus error. I partially corrected the problem by changing the %F
to %lF since the real numbers were declared as double, but I still
get the error. Has anyone else had any trouble with it ?
