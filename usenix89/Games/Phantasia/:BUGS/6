Thanks for everyone's help with the time.h problem, but thats the least of it.

I really need help with the two errors at line 227 and 228.

I tried deleting them to see what happened, and in one other file with the
tm-yday variable it kludged on.  The lines which use it say "today = (time&)
->tm_yday I believe, and it also says it needs a structure/union pointer
in the same line.

Further down the make install path, it says it cant identify a whole string of
variables in the gamesupport.c file.


Maybe I should just give up?

Thanks in advance,

Rob Wheeler
