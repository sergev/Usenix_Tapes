Here is the source to the latest version of Phantasia.
It's an extremely mindless game, but fun nevertheless.

I've fixed all reported bugs, and incorporated many helpful
suggestions from Phantasia 3.2.  I've added a few features
like timing out waiting options.  Also, the game checks for
a successful open the first time it accesses a file.  (It
used to assume all files existed, which caused many people
grief when they were not careful enought setting up the game.)

I'm not sure if the game will fit on a PDP-11 anymore.  Try
defining SMALL and taking out OK_TO_PLAY and ENEMY in the
makefile to make it fit if you have problems.

This should run on just about any flavor of UN*X.  If anyone
encounters problems specific to a particular UN*X, let me
know about it (with a fix if possible), and I will incorporate
it into the next version.

Use 'Makefile.xstr' if you have 'xstr', otherwise use 'Makefile.noxst'.

I'm open to suggestions/comments/fixes.  However stick all flames
in your ear.
