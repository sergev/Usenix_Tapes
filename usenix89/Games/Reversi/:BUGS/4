Well, on my antiquated Sun UNIX 2.0 system, and on the antiquated 4.2BSD
system that it's based on, they are the same.  I don't know where you got
your "termlib" and "termcap", but you didn't get them from 4.2BSD...

Neither "termcap" nor "termlib" do any screen updating *per se*; they just
provide a way to say "what do I have to shove down a file descriptor to get
whatever's on the other end of that file descriptor to (move the cursor to
(X,Y), clear the rest of the line, etc.).  You may be thinking of the Ken
Arnold "curses" package running on top of "termcap" as the old version, and
the Mark Horton "curses" package that comes with S5R2 and has a new
"terminfo" package as the new version.
