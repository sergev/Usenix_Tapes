Hey!  -ltermlib is the new name for -ltermcap, so that "termcap" now
refers to the database /etc/termcap and "termlib" refers to the small
handful of library routines provided in support of the database.  The
screen update software was provided in a separate library, -lcurses.

With System V Release 2, Mark Horton's "terminfo" was made available.
This is a whole system supplanting the termcap package; the termlib
routines were bundled into the terminfo-based -lcurses.  The terminfo
database is quite different in form from /etc/termcap (e.g., it is
divided into subdirectories for faster access and is pre-compiled).

terminfo != termlib
