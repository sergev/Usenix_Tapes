Included below is the original source to robots modified so that it will
run on XENIX Release 3.0 (A System III clone) Hopefully all of the 
changes should be reversable by not defining XENIX, as I don't have
access to a non XENIX machine I can't check it. 

THIS IS NOT A SHAR ARCHIVE, just the source to the robots game. Remove the
text between the -Cut Here- and the signature at the end of the file
and compile it with cc -O robots.c -o robots -lcurses -ltermcap
then install it in the /usr/games directory. The man page is in the original
posting.
