You should have continued to get a score like:
<1+72> level: 138    score: -2143245923500 robots are now scrap heaps
(My week score was positive, so it didn't make it in the score file.)
(The follwing looks also nice:
Top Twenty Robotists for this Week:
Rank   Score    Name
1      12562445 dik: chickened out on level 218.
2      5514803  mich: eaten on level 20.)

I think the fix should be in the penalty for zapping robots.  As it is now
your teleports per level decrease by one for every robot zapped, but it
will never decrease below 1.  As it will increase again by one when entering
the next level (mostly at least) you will at least receive 2 new teleports.
As surviving a level by zapping on a small screen requires in general 1 to
2 zaps this is sufficient to continue living.  So teleports per level should
be allowed to drop to 0; which must be increased to 1 just before the next
level.
