If you have installed the sonic patch there is an easy way to get as many
points as you wish in Robots. Create your own termcap entry which is identical
with the termcap you already use except for the li entry which you set to
a small number (~10). The easiest way to do this is to use your own termcap
file and let the environment variable TERMCAP point to it. You will now be 
able to play robots with a very small screen.

If you survive to about level 12 you will find out that there are so many 
robots on the screen that you only have to zap about once per round to get
a wall of scrap heaps arround you. Thus you can go on as long as you want.
I got fed up after about 10 minutes when my score was as follows

Top Twenty Robotists of All Time:
Rank   Score    Name
1      204474677 mike: chickened out on level 64.

It should be trivial to fix robots so that it doesn't work for screens where
li * co < 1000 if you can be bothered to do so!
