These pick up the "so" and "se" entries in the termcap file.
They mean "standout mode start" and "standout mode end".
This program is intended for 4.2 BSD.
If your system doesn't deal with standout mode, it's best to delete the
lines which use this mode.
It is used for making a newly achieved score "stand out" from the rest.
