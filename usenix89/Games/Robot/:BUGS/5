I wish that the modified sources for SysV had not so many whitespace
changes.  It sure makes producing a joint source file for conditional
compilation difficult!

Note that on SysV it is possible that a not-perfect terminfo file can
cause 'robots' to crash.  I have found this using the 4425 terminfo that
wandered across the net a while ago.  The program dies with an addressing
error while doing 'tputs'.  Anyone else with this type of problem?

Background information:  I'm using either a VAX750 with 4.2BSD, or a
3B2 with SysVRel2.  The 4410 or vt100 terminfo's work reasonably well
with robots, the 4425 terminfo makes it crash.  No apparent problems with
termcap on the BSD.
