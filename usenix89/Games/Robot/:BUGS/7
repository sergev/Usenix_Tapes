Recently someone posted a new robots for SysV. Well, that program
doesn't work either. It wouldn't compile with the following problems:
robots.c
==============
(634)  unknown size
(641)  l_type undefined
(641)  F_WRLCK undefined
(641)  warning: F_WRLCK may be used before set
(642)  l_whence undefined
(643)  l_start undefined
(644)  l_len undefined
(645)  l_pid undefined
....etc, etc

Has anyone gotten this to work on UNIX SysV.2 on a VAX 11/780?
