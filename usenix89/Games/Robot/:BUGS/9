WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!  Public thanks to
Andy for a simple, but essential, tip.  Robots now builds on my System
III system (with a change to the Makefile to add -ltermlib).  I haven't
played it yet, but IT'S BUILT.

Now, does anyone have a nice modification to Galaxy's use_term.c so that
it will work on System III?
