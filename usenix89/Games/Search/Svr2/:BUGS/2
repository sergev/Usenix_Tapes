Darn!  I was hoping I edited that in time, but apparently not.  The
posted /dev/stdin appears to give root write access to directories
as well as files.  (Try "od -c </tmp >/dev/stdin".)  Also, it doesn't
deal with opening /dev/stdin when fd 0 is not already open (gets you
a dup of /dev/stdin, which you didn't have open; not sure what the
consequences are but they probably aren't good.)
