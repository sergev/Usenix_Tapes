I have a solution to (1), since snake2 only uses a quarter-second
timeout (thanks to Robert Toxen's tick* routines); but NOTE THAT IT
IS A BUSY WAIT, NOT A TRUE IDLE WAIT.  IT WILL PROBABLY KILL YOUR
CPU.

As for (2), I can fix that one, too.

I am going to have to fly to Minneapolis tomorrow to give a 2-day
class on a language I wrote, so I won't be able to touch this until
at least Friday.  If I get snake2 working for SVR2, I'll post the
source (with #ifdef SYS5 for the new stuff) to net.sources.
