Enclosed is the source for a solitaire game written in the Icon Programming
Language.  One of the interesting things about this version of solitaire is
that it will take over and play on it's own.  I call it auto pilot mode. 
The documentation for the program is in a comment block at the top of the
source.  Since Icon is not "yet" a mainstream language I figured misc would
be the place to post this.

If you want more info on Icon send me some mail.  Icon is available for
MS-DOS, ATARI ST GEMDOS, UNIX, VMS and a number of other systems.  Last I
heard it was included on the BSD distribution tape.  It's running on almost
all implementations of SVR2 and Xenix too.  It's a bit large to post but I
can send you an address at the University of Arizona where you can obtain
Icon for the cost of media and postage.  It's fully supported by the CS
Department at the University of Arizona as The Icon Project.
