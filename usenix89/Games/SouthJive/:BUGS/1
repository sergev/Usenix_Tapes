Summary: careful with that jive source!
Posted: Sat Apr  5 05:59:43 1986


   *** --- *** 

The jive source recently posted here has been hacked and probably
won't work *as is*.  You'll want to delete the references to "buf"
(including the declaration) and sprintfs and such should be changed
to printf.  The reason for this is that it was intdended to be used
as a function in which a string is passed to it, and the "jive"d 
version is passed back.  Needless to say, it didn't work.  It *can*
work if you hack up the lex.yy.c file to declare the function to
return a char * and possibly other interactive programs should be added
to interact (it's late).

Also, careful with that memory; if you try to use it on pdp's or
other non-virtual memory machines, you'll have to strip some of the
code away and change the values of the initializing parameters... You'll
get a good idea of how far to strip once you try compiling and linking
and notice the error messages.

% lex jive.lex; cc lex.yy.c -ll -o jive
