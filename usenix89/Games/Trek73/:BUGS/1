There is another nasty bug in trek that I've run across.
trek will seg fault durring the computer disress command if there
is a disressed star system.  The bug is in computer.c

The line:
			systemname(e), .....
should be changed to
			Systemname[e->systemname], .....

The other bug for those people who might not have gotten it was
a bcopy somewhere.  The problem was that an '&' is needed in before
the structure 'Now' as an argument to bcopy.  The was most likely
appeared when the code was moved from v6 to v7 since the v6 C did
not pass structures.
