In Trek73, the routine round is not declared in cmds2.c where it
is used.  This probably will not cause a problem for most people, but
at least with masscomp compilers, all floats are passed as doubles
on the stack and so the default definition of int round() will
not work.   This shows up when you use command 12.  This
can be fixed by adding
extern float round;
at the top of cmds2.c
