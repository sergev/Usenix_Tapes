     For those who are trying to convert Trek73 to run on an
MSDOS machine, you'll have to change:

	time(0);

to

	time(NULL);

if you're using the large memory model.  In the first case,
an integer is passed to time(); in the second, a LONG is
passed to time().  A NULL, in the large memory model, is
defined as a LONG, and not as an integer.  If you pass zero
as an integer to time() (in the large memory model), time() will
think that you've passed a pointer to it and will happily
thrash some random location in memory.  All this was found with the
Microsoft C compiler, version 4.00, BTW.
