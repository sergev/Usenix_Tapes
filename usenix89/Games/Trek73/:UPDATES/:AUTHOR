Enclosed is the latest version of Trek73.

The newest feature is that of "designer ships", ie, the designing
of other ships besides the four default designes (DN, CA, CL, DD).
It has been playtested, but I am sure that there are still a lot
of bugs in it.  Please send all bug reports to:

	okamoto@ucbvax.berkeley.edu
		or
	..!ucbvax!okamoto

Enjoy!
