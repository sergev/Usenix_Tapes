Trek73 is a computer-simulated battle based on the famous
Star Trek television series and
the game Star Fleet Battles.
Via computer terminal, you can clash with enemy
battle cruisers, such as Klingon D-7's and Romulan Sparrowhawks,
and use the same strategies
that Captain Kirk has used.
Like Kirk, you control a Federation vessel similar to the
Enterprise; a computer program directs the enemy.
Victory can fall into several categories:
.sp
.PP
Decisive Victory -- You completely destroy or cripple the
attacking force.
.sp
.PP
Tactical Victory -- You out-maneuver the enemy using
high-speed escapes, corbomite bluffs, `play dead' tactics;
or the enemy surrenders.
.sp
.PP
Moral Victory -- You surrender or self-destruct and destroy
each other.

All distances are measured in megameters, one million meters
(abbreviated `M').
Speed is expressed in `warp factors'.
Each warp factor equals 100M per second.\**
.FS
Although technically incorrect, it does save the player from
having to compute cube roots.
.FE
All angles are expressed in common degrees from zero to
360, measured counter-clockwise from the x-axis, similar to
reading a protractor.
Only two dimensions are used.\**
.FS
This saves the player from having to work out problems in
spherical geometry.

Play is as follows:
.sp
.PP
1.  You issue one of a number of commands (fire phasers, change
course, launch antimatter pods, surrender, etc.) by typing
the appropriate code number into the keyboard;
.sp
.PP
2.  The enemy, under programmed instructions, issues a
similar command;
.sp
.PP
3.  Both your commands are executed (phasers are fired,
probes are launched, damages are assessed, courses changed,
etc.) while the vessels move through space;
.sp
.PP
4.  Unless certain end-game conditions are met (you destroy
the enemy, the enemy destroys you, your out-maneuver the
enemy, you both destroy each other, or one party surrenders)
the above steps are repeated.
