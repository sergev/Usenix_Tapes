21.  Detonate Engineering.
.PP
[nothing | [y | n]]
.PP
This order, issued after the previous one, manually detonates
your engineering section.

22.  Alter Torpedo And Phaser Firing Parameters.
.PP
[[y [Launch Speed] [Time Delay] [Proximity Fuse]] | n]
[[y [Firing Percentage]] | n]
.PP
This option allows you to change the launch speeds, time and
proximity delays of all torpedos.
At the beginning of play, torpedos are launched at warp
twelve, have ten second time fuses, and 200M proximity
fuses.
Any vessel or engineering section which comes within the
proximity range will cause the torpedo to explode.
.sp
.PP
Phaser firing percentages can also be altered.
A phaser bank need not fire its full charge.

23.  Defenseless Ruse.
.PP
[e | p]
.PP
Another name for this tactic is `playing dead'.
When issued, your shields are dropped to zero, and power is
diverted to your engines or phaser banks.
Hopefully, the enemy will believe you dead and come too
close or break off their attack.
You should then be able to fire or run in the opposite
direction.

24.  Attempt Corbomite Bluff(s).
There were two corbomite bluffs in the television series;
one was against a midget operating a huge space vessel the
other was against Romulan attackers.
Both have been incorporated into this game.
Whichever bluff issued is selected randomly.

25.  Surrender, If Possible.
.PP

never accepted one.
.sp
.LP
26.  Ask Enemy To Surrender.
.PP
This order ends a message to the enemy demanding that they
surrender.
Please bear in mind that Romulans are the most suicidal.

.LP
27.  Initiate Self-Destruct.
.PP
This order activates a twenty-second self-destruct sequence.
Because final destruct does not occur until ten turns after
initialization, it is best to start it early, if at all.
When you do explode, you hope that you explosive force will
also destroy your attackers.
.sp
.LP
28.  Abort Self-Destruct.
.PP
This order, issued after the previous one, halts the
destruct sequence.
Self-destruct cannot be aborted withing five seconds to
detonation.

and associated descriptions of each.
.sp
.LP
31 And Up.
.PP
Future options, currently being designed in Trek74, will
include Dr. Daystrom's paranoid, M5 multi-tronics computer
which will take over while you relax; or battle someone else
who is on another terminal; or battle in teams; or have a
free-for-all against nine other starships.
