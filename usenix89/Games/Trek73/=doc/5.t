Simple Strategy
.sp
.PP
If you are a beginner, a simple strategy to follow is A:
fight only one attacker; B: pursue him (code 14) at warp
factor one; C: lock on all phasers (code 3); D: continuously
take position reports (code 12) and watch his range; E:
when he gets within 1000M, fire all phasers (code 1) and
keep on firing when he is in range; F: When the enemy is out
of range, take damage reports and scans of the enemy (codes
17 and 18).

After a few trial games using the above strategy, you will
want to become as efficient as the enemy at firing photon
torpedos.
Finally, when you master launching antimatter probes, you
can designate more that one attacker.

Trek73's History
.sp
.PP
Trek73 was programmed on a Hewlett-Packard 2000C system by
William K. Char, Perry Lee, and Dan Gee.
In January, 1973, Mr. Char started with a few ideas and five
months later, in May, introduced $SPACE, his first version.

.PP
Space had only 14 commands and comprised one 10K program.
Response was so great that new ideas flooded in and in June,
work on Trek73 was begun.
Over 70 recordings of past shows were reviewed to
reconstruct dialogue and vessels.
On October 8, 1973, Trek73 was introduced.

In 1984, Dave Pare at Univeristy of California at San Diego and Chris Williams
at the University of California at Berkeley independently translated
the BASIC code into C to run under BSD UNIX.\**

In April 1985, Jeff Okamoto and Peter Yee, both
at the University of California at Berkeley combined the two
versions into one, fixing bugs and adding new commands.
The user-settable options were also added.
