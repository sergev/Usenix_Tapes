Here is a simple graphing program (makes line and point graphs with
labelled axes) written specifically for the AT&T 7300, but using
GKS routines to do all the graphics; it ought to be port-able to
any machine with GKS graphics without too much trouble (if it can
have several windows on the screen at once, one for commands and
one for pictures).

Send me mail if you have questions about it, or (I hope) bug fixes.
