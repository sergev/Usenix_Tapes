We tried to make the Gnuplot posting perfect, but no such luck!

We'll be glad to mail out the latest files if you send us a Self-Addressed
Stamped Envelope with a formatted 360K PC floppy.  Let us know what files you
want:  source code, help files, or executable for MS-DOS, VMS, Pyramid.
Send a couple formatted floppies if you want them all!

There were a few typos in the help files, but nothing important enough
to warrant a new posting yet...

If compiling on a PC, please change MAX_UDFS from 30 to 20 in 'plot.h'
(inside #ifdef PC).

Three PC files--make.msc, corgraph.asm, and pcgraph.asm--had a couple lines
of junk on the end of them, but fortunately, they'll work anyway (MASM
ignores anything after an END statement; MAKE complains, but does its job
anyway).  Just delete the lines after the link statement in make.msc if
you want to...  Also, the 'help' program doesn't work under MS-DOS, but we've
got the help files formatted into a single file which you can print out at
least, to approximate documentation!  If you want this, send a floppy per
above, or a couple bucks to cover photocopying...

Two VMS files--COMPILE.COM and LINK.COM--were missing.  They follow this
paragraph.  BTW:  make sure you SET TERM/NOWRAP before running GNUPLOT!
