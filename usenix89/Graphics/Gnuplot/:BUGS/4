Sorry, I left out one resolved bug report from the list.

4) The fclose in get_data fixed a problem with multiple reads of the same
data file in a single session. Microsoft C was never closing the thing,
but reopening it each time, eventually failing when it ran out of file
descriptors.

Some people may want to default cont to TRUE if compiling without
/DPC to retain the previous behavior. I want to call attention to the
fact that my changes introduce an incompatability between the /DPC
switch and all others. In other words, msc /DPC /DTEK will result
in TEK support with a broken continuous switch (always on).

The only simple way to change this is to move the #ifndef PC...
getchar stuff into each non-PC TERM_text unconditionally. I did not
bother because a single PC version supporting both console and
terminal operations under MS-DOS seemed only marginally useful.

To the authors: this is a very useful program, and a fine job.
Please consider this and my previous posting "official" bug
reports, preempting all other communications. Thanks.
