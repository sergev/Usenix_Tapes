Well, we are here.  I don't know which mail your using or how well your
maps have been upkept, but we have been here for quite a while.  If you
continue having problems try routing the mail through any of the machines
we are connected to { bpa, cbmvax, cbit, cuaepd, devon, drexel, ge-mc3i, 
hutch, hvrford, psuvax1, pyrnj, snark, swatsun, temvax, 3B2WS310 }
I'd suggest pyrnj, psuvax1, bpa, or cbmvax. 


But since you have posted this message, I think a followup is appropriate
as the response contains information useful to other GNUPLOT users.

I don't think this is a problem.  The man page was quickly constructed 
to describe the basic abilities of our program, not to teach you how to 
use it.  Time was a major consideration (translation - it WAS rushed),
but personally I prefer laconic man pages.  On-line help and the makeshift
help document are supposed to provide the details of program use.

The VMS-like help program was posted (usable by UNIX systems).  We offered 
a formatted version of the help files for MSDOS users, and we have learned 
that someone has recently ported the help program to MSDOS.  We hope
to be able to distribute this with the next release of our program.

Hmmmm, you haven't describe the problem in detail so I can't speculate
on it's cause, only that this is the first time I have ever heard
of this happening.   It works on all the systems we've tried (including SUN's)

A POSTSCRIPT driver has already been written by Rich Burridge at SUN Australia.
The driver was developed on a SUN 3/50 running V3.2 of SUN's OS.  This
will also be included in the next release of GNUPLOT.

Briefly.  Polar plots should be added.  Also maybe a neat SUN driver...maybe.
PGA and Hercules graphics card might well be supported in the new version,
and anything else we deem important. So PLEASE, if you have any suggestions,
don't hesitate send them to vu-vlsi!plot.  

                                   Hope this was helpful
