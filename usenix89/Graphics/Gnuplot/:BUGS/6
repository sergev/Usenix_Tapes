Yes, I posted the entire EGA LIB to comp.sys.ibm.pc about a week before the
Gnuplot posting.  If you missed it for one reason or another, just edit
MAKE.MSC and remove the /DEGALIB from the TERMFLAGS line.  (You'll have to
get rid of the 'ega' library request in LINK.OPT too.)  Gnuplot will still
have EGA support through the 'egabios' driver--it'll just be slower, that's
all!  If you were unable to get the EGA LIB from comp.sys.ibm.pc, you might
try mailing a formatted floppy with SASE to the author.  He says he will send
out the whole library, including source code!

BTW:  there was a bug in the Hercules driver as posted.  Make sure you get
the corrected version from net.sources...
