cat <<'---- CUT HERE'
The HP laserjet driver I posted to net a while ago had
(at least) one bug: It will not plot correctly on
a 16 bit int - machine (like PC) due to an overflow.

Also it used calloc() rather heavily: the allocated
raster/page was >400KB and it didn't fit in the PC memory.

Now here is a new version where the raster uses 52K
and the overflow bug is fixed.

This version is in the form of a diff to the ORIGINAL distributed
V1.1 gnuplot term.c. There are also some fixes to the distributed
HP26 driver.

This has been tested in HP 9500 HP-UX and
HP Vectra PC (IBM PC clone) PC-DOS w/Microsoft-C 4.0

Patch and enjoy.

The following term.c.diff is done by
$ diff term.c.orig term.c >term.c.diff
