This shar file contains the help directory tree, to be used by the
VMS-like help program which has been posted regularly.  The files
are also used by the 'vmshelp.csh' script to create 'gnuplot.hlp',
a single help file in VMS help file format.  'gnuplot.hlp' is needed
to create a Gnuplot help library in VMS, and is also used to build the
help tree under MS-DOS with the program BUILDHLP.

If you follow the convention of putting help files in /usr/help on your
system, then you may want to 'su' and 'cd /usr' before executing this script.
