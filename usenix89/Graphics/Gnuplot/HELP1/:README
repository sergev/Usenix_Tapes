This is a VMS-like help program for Unix.  It was posted to the net a
while ago, but we can't find the author's name anywhere.  It's needed by
Gnuplot (a plotting program posted last week, see <425@vu-vlsi>) to provide
on-line help.

To whomever wrote this:  sorry we're unable to give you credit here!  It's
a very nice program... :-)

This code compiles under 4.2bsd but not SysV, and definitely not MS-DOS.
MS-DOS users will have to put up with 'gnuplot.mem', which is just the
help files formatted into pseudo-manual, suitable for printing.  You can
get it and the PC executable by sending us a formatted 360K PC floppy:

	GNUPLOT project
	EE Dept.
	Villanova University
	Villanova, PA  19085

or send a couple bucks and we'll mail you the printed version...
