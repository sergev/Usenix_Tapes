Recently, a package called GNUPLOT was posted which required a VMS-like
help utility.  Unfortunately, the help utility provided for unix would not
work under MS-DOS/PC-DOS.  What follows is a first pass at a MS-DOS version
of this utility.   It may be compiled with MSC V4.0.  My apologies for:

    1. Not "ifdef'ing" this into the original code.  My code is too dirty
       in it's present state.
    2. Not "shar'ing" this posting.  I'm on a MS-DOS machine at the moment.
    3. Not including any documentation.  I have not written any.

Please note the problem of token size due to the filename size limitation of
MS-DOS.  This will require the user to rename the GNUPLOT help files slightly
to work.  When I have time to fully test (read as debug) my version using 
lookup tables, I will post it.   

Also note that you must include an appropriate help file definition in the
plot.h file.  What I use is:

#define HELP  "\\usr\\bin\\help gnuplot"

The following file is 'help.h':
