The following is a quick program to print the ray trace posted recently
to net.source (and net.graphics?) on an IMAGEN printer using IMPRESS.
The program works by quantizing the image into sixteen gray levels.  The
impress file generated defines a "font" of sixteen greyscale glyphs and
outputs the data.dis file as a series of characters.  The file takes a
while to print (200K glyphs).  Some spurious contours are evident.  A
real halftoning program would be better.

In the spirit of the sources posted, this program doesn't take any
arguments :-)
