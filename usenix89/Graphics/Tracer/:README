Well, I've properly learned C in the past 2 weeks, I've learned physics,
and I've learned art. Version 1.0 was a feeble attempt at programming.
Version 2.0 is *awsome*.

Changes: version 2.0 now does proper refraction all the way across
	 the board. very amazing.
	 You can sink the balls into the floor nicely.
	 You can display stuff on the floor. 
	 There is no need to recompile to change the ball data.
	 You can change the input and output files via command line
	 arguments.
	 You can pipe through it.
	 It looks good.

    This is still a simple package as far as the number of shapes it can handle (one), but it provides a very decent base to build on for any math gods or godesses out there. all the algorithms currently in use are the proper ones. there will be no updates for them. (fortunately for my mailbox.) The code runs faster now, but the refarction algorithms have also lengthened the running time, so on the average it's about the same, if not a little bit slower. Please use this in any way you like...  (but give me credit =).  f -------------------------------------------------------------------- # This is a shell archive.  Remove anything before this line,
