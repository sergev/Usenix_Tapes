NAME
     tracer- run a simple ray tracing procedure

SYNOPSIS
     tracer -o [filename] -i [filename] -s <filename> -S<number>

DESCRIPTION
     Tracer is a program developed originally to study how
     ray tracing works, and was later modified to the present state
     to make it more compatible for animated film production.

     It is capable of depicting a number of balls (up to 150)
     and a plane that is covered with a tiling of any bitmapped picture.


OPTIONS
     -o Chooses the output data file. If no argument is givin, stdout
        is used. If the option is not used the default is data.dis.

     -i Chooses the input (ball) data file. If no argument is given, stdin
        is used. If the option is not used the default is bdata.i.
 
     -s Chooses the file containing the tiling bitmap. It requires an
        an argument. If the option is not used the default is pat.def.

     -S Chooses contrast of the pattern. 0.0 is no contrast, 1.0 is maximum
        contrast. 1.0 is the default. (useful for fading during animation)

PROGRAM NOTES
     This program generates a file containing a header with x and y sizes,
     followed by the data in 8-bit greyscale, one pixel to a character, in 
     scanlines.
     There are two neccessary input files: ball data, and a pattern bitmap.
     The tiling bitmap can be digitized data, it must be in the form of 
     scan lines no longer than 512 bytes followed by newlines.
     the ball data is of the following form:

     x y z rad ior refract reflect diffuse ambient

     on each line where x y & z are the coordinates of the center of 
     the ball, rad is the radius of the ball, ior is the index of refraction
     for translucent materials (index of refraction for glass is about 1.5)
     the last four numbers determine how much of each atrribute is used.
     Thus a pure silver ball would have 0.0 1.0 0.0 0.0 as the last numbers,
     and a pure glass ball would have 1.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 .


FILES
     ./bdata.i	default ball data
     ./pat.def  default floor pattern
     ./data.dis default output file

BUGS
     As with any good software, the complexity of this program hides 
     all bugs.
