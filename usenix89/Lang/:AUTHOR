The following is a somewhat altered shortc.  As I have a cc which
uses short names and a cpp which doesn't support flexnames I am
faced with altering the original source of some programs to get
them to pass through my CC.  The original shortc was very useful
in this regard but I was unhappy with its algorithm of prepending
characters to the names to make them unique.

I therefore altered shortc to instead use something in my opinion
more swave and deboner i.e. recapitalization
to eliminate collisions.  I also altered it to have an option (-c)
which will emit a C program which will filter the names to their
unique counterparts.  The C program is very rudimentary but is
in the form of a template which can be easily extended (if
you make a more sophisticated version of the template please
send me a copy).

Finally, I realised that it used a last truncation
wins algorithm which makes it impossible guarantee that a symbol
will not be truncated by ordering the files or by including a
special file at the front which is a list of symbols you want
unaltered.  I 'fixed' it (commented out some code) so that
first truncation wins.  If you saw the original posting I 
am resubmitting this because I only realised that last truncation
wins after I sent it out.

Enjoy,

David Albrecht
