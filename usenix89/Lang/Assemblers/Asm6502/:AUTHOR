Posted to net.sources is a commenting 6502 disassembler, currently for
the Commodore 128 but easily modifiable for any 6502-based computer
(it uses a .labels file and a hash table, and a very slight amount of
Commodore-specific knowledge). Would especially appreciate it if
someone would modify it for the C-64, don't really feel like typing in
a new .labels file. Enjoy, and leave any suggestions for improvements
in my mailbox (I'm sure there will be a LOT of improvements suggested,
because it was just a two-day hack to solve a particular problem).
