This is the uuencoded version of the file DOS3SRC.ARC.  To deal with it,
use your favorite editor to remove everything above (and including) the
line which says "CUT HERE", then run the rest through the uudecode
program to produce the file DOS3SRC.ARC in its normal binary format.
Then, transfer it to your PC using an 8-bit tranfer format such as 
XMODEM or kermit in image mode.  Use ARC to de-archive it, and off you
go!  For a discussion of DOS3SRC, see net.micro.pc.
