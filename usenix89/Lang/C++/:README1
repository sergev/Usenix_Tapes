=============================================================================
Below is a context diff, suitable for use with patch, to the 4.2 BSD /lib/cpp.
It provides two enhancements:

	1) Code provided by Doug Gwyn of the Ballistics Research Lab to
	   implement the recent-SV/ANSI C #elif preprocessor directive. This
	   code is not dependant on any command line option, since I figure
	   it is something that everyone will want, and it is something
	   that will be a standard in the C community. (BTW, the crummy
	   indentation is my fault, not his -- it follows the current "style".)

	2) Code written by me, based loosely on the existing code, to recognize
	   C++ comments that start with // and continue to the end of line.
	   This feature must be enabled with the -B command line argument.
	   ("B" is reminiscent of the old B language which had the //
	   comment, which is where C++ took it back from. Not terribly
	   mnemonic, I know.)

Those of you with C++ should change your CC shell script to invoke /lib/cpp
with the new -B option.

Enjoy,
