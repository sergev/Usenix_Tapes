The built_in/1 predicate I distributed earlier fails to treat
arithmetic predicates correctly. If they are not expanded (by use
of expand_exprs/2 (sometimes expanded_exprs/2) they will be arguments
to is/1. This was why I commented them out of my earlier posting.
If expanded, however, they are translated into predicates of the form
$<name>/<arity+1>. These will not be recognised by built_in/1 as it
stands.

Here is the corrected version of the arithmetic ops list:
