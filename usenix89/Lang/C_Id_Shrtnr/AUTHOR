I wrote this in about 20 minutes so that I could use it to
 shorten some identifers in my code.  Because of the interest
 I thought I would post it.  It is written in lex and is
 infact about 60 lines of code.  I included the lex'ed
 file for those without lex and that accounts for the
 650 lines of source.  Play with it and see what you think.
 It is a BIG hack.
