/*
Expert system inference engine

This inference engine is backwards-chaining only and features the
running of binary files if:

	1) they are antecedents associated with a particuar consequent
	   being proved, or
	2) they are consequents which have been proven true by verify().
	   their actual predicate value will be determined by their returned
	   result after running.

This inference engine is designed with diagnostics in mind and so will probably
be best suited for this application.  Later revisons will include 
forward-chaining so that the user will have the opportunity to give pre-existant
conditons, or that these my be supplied by the calling process.

(If you cant tell by the above description -- I am very excited about the 
possibilties presented in this form of computer control of the diagnostic
process... Geo.)

See structure design for details of operation,  but basically the 

inference reads in all of the compiled information as produced by the
    rule compiler.
    
it proceeds to attempt to prove each consequent by proving the truth
	or falseness of any antecedent associated with this consequent.
if any antecedent of a consequent turns out to be a consequent itself, then
        the inference engine will recursively attempt to prove this consequent.

the process is complete when all of the predicate values of the consequents has
	been determined.
	
Additional features which I may put in at a later time is the abiltiy for
the inference engine to expalin itself to the user when the user asks why
the inference engine needs to know the predicate value of a particular
antecedent.   This will be done by forward and backward chaining of predicat
clauses, the truth of each will be displayed.
