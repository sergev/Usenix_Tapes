In top(1), where it prints out the size of the job and the resident
size of the job, it assumes that clicks are 512 bytes.  It does a
right shift by 1 to convert to K and then prints out the numbers.  The
correct thing to do is to use the macro ctob() which is defined in
param.h.  I don't have the context diff for this but it should be easy
to find.  This only effects non-vax machines probably.
