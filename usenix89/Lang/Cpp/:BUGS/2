A few weeks back, I posted a set of diffs that patched the 4.2 BSD /lib/cpp
source code to implement #elif, and, with the (new) -B option, accept the C++
// style comments. The #elif diffs came from Doug Gwyn at BRL, but were from the
System V version, so I had to type them in for the BSD version by hand. As
a result, the following bug crept in (reported by mcgill-vision!mouse):

> + 			pperror ( "If-less elif"< (char *) 0, (char *) 0);
						^

	bug ------------------------------------+

The "<" should be a ",". It comes from not releasing the SHift key fast
enough (:-).

Hopefully this hasn't bitten anyone too badly.
