It's been quite a while since my lasting posting of this package, and
there have been a few additions and changes, so here's an update...

Part 1 contains the user include file "dbug.h", the runtime support
routines in "dbug.c" and the Makefile.

Part 2 contains misc files and the nroff source for the documentation.

Part 3 contains a uuencoded documentation file (from pieces in part 2)
suitable for printing on most printers after uudecoding.  It was 
uuencoded so various characters like escapes would not get eaten
somewhere along the way...

Finally, the shar files were produced on a System V machine, and
give checksum errors for each file when unpacked on a BSD machine
so you can probably safely ignore any checksum errors if they
occur for ALL files.
