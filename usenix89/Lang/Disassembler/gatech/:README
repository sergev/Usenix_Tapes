 Attached is a disassembler for Intel MCS-48 family single component micro-
 processors.  I wrote this a while ago, and hereby put it into the public
 domain. 

 This program would accept an Intel Hex format file, and produce a listing
 type file (with address and opcode) or assembly type file (with -a option).
 To compile it, just use "cc main.c decode.c utility.c" (UCB CC) or
 "cl main.c decode.c utility.c" (MicroSoft C).
