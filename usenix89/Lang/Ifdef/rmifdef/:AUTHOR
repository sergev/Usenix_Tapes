Some people asked for a program to selectively remove ifdefs from a file.
I wrote this program some time ago and it seems this is about what they
wanted.  Therefore I submit this program to the public domain.  You can do
anything with this program, except say that you wrote it.
Compile this as follows:
	lex rmifdef.l; cc -o rmifdef lex.yy.c
