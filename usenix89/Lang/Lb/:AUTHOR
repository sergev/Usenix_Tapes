The lisp pretty-printer shell script I posted some time ago has become
obsolete if you have the "packages" feature.  (The script bombs on colons.)
It's a one-line fix, but here's the whole thing anyway, in case you missed
it.  Colons work now.  Backquotes always worked (no expansion).  Sharps
never worked and probably never will.
