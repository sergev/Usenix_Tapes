The following is a copy of the Logic Minimization program contained in
my book:

                 Computer-Aided Logic Design
                 Robert M. McDermott
                 Howard W. Sams & Co., Inc.
                 ISBN: 0-672-22436-4.

It is written in BASIC (No Flames Please), and has been run on the
ITT-XTRA (and IBM-PC Compatibles) and the TRS-80 (Model III).
It performs multiple output logic minimization, albeit slowly.
