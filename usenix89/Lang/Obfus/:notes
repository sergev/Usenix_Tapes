Well, since I didn't win the obfuscated C code contest this year, and
since have seen or heard anything about who *DID*[1], I thought I'd post
my entries. I'd be real interested in others' entries -- in fact, I
think all entries should be posted anyway; it's kinda like a modern 
art exhibit.  We might even get written up in the "arts" section of
some newspaper...
[1]: don't flame me, I have been keeping up with net.announce and have
yet to see anything; that was a newsgroup which was claimed to be used
for postings on this whole affair.

I had two entries:
The first is my stab at a one-liner.  It compiles on anything that has
a C compiler. Give it any number of numerical arguments.
------------
#define _ putchar
#define _00 main
#define _01 '\n'
#define _10 (_0,_1)char**_1;{if(_0/(1+1))_11(
_00 _10 atoi(_1[1]),_1),_(_01),_00(_0-1,_1+1);}_11 _10 _0/2,_1);_("01"[_0%2]);}
------------

The second is my artsie-fartsie entry. It doesn't take args, and it's
not interesting (altho it does print stuff). It's there to look at --
why, I don't know.
