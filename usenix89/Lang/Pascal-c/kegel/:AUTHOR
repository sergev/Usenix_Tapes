Here's a Pascal to C translator which correctly handles function,
procedure, and most type declarations (yay!).  It is adapted from p2c.c 1.1 of
the mod.sources archives; I suppose it should be called "p2c, version 2.0".  
I wrote it in anticipation of a need to convert a VERY large Turbo Pascal 
program, but the need never arose... so the resulting program is untested 
and unpolished.  Nevertheless, it should be interesting and useful to those 
willing to play with it a bit.
Cheers,
