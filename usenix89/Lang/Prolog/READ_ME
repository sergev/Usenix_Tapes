A THRILLING GAME IN PROLOG WITH HIGH SPEED HIGH RESOLUTION VT100 GRAPHICS

This program is donated to the public domain and may be used, modified
re-distributed, or simply throw away as seen fit by the user.

With this program I hope to fill a 'gap' in the market - I have often seen
requests for "really badly written banal games written in FORTRAN" - since
PROLOG has been described as the FORTRAN of logic programming I hope this
program fills that gap.

I make no apologies for the code, though I suspect that purests may object
to the "(cut,...,fail);true" constructs that are liberally sprinkled
throughout the program.

Plans are underway to write yet more thrilling, exciting, spectacular,
addictive, brilliant, wonderful, enchanting games in SASL, HOPE, PARLOG, 
ML, etc.
