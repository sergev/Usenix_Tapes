In <188@popvax.UUCP> I gave context diffs to allow the BSD versions of
yacc to take two optional arguments that would make it easier to use
the changes to /usr/lib/yaccpar suggested in ``Introduction to Compiler
Compiler Construction with UNIX,'' by A. T. S. Schreidner and
H. G. Friedman Jr., Prentice-Hall, 1985, ISBN 0-13-474396-2  01.  These
modifications lead to much improved error diagnostics.

There are few differences between the BSD and System V versions of the
yacc sources, but enough cosmetic changes to make the original patches
fail when applied to the System V code.  This posting is in response to
several requests for the System V diffs.

With these modifications to yacc, and assuming the modified prototype
is in /usr/lib/yaccpar.mod, you should put a line:

	YFLAGS = -at -f /usr/lib/yaccpar.mod

The patches to yaccpar are not included, if you want them, buy the
book!!

If you have patch, all you need to do is copy the source for yacc.1 manual
page to the yacc source directory, and give the command:

	patch dextern diffs

in the yacc source directory.  The files affected are dextern, files,
y1.c and y2.c and yacc.1 (the manual page).  No changes are needed to
y3.c or to y4.c.  Cut at the line to get diffs.
