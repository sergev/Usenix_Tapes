	There may be such a requirement, but it has nothing
to do with copyrighting a document.  According to "Legal Care
For Your Software," p. 36: "The Copyright offices requests
only the first twenty-five pages and the last twenty-five
pages of the program."

	On p. 37 it says: "If you forget to send the code you
may, theoretically, be liable for a fine.  . . . the fine
is rarely (if ever) imposed . . .

	According to the same book, p. 29:

	The internationally recognized copyright symbox, [circle
with a C in it], should always be the first part of the notice.
Since CRT screens and most dot matrix printers don't have a [circle
with a C in it], you can substitute and use a (C).  The
second part of the notice is the word "Copyright."  Technically
this is unnecessary as long as you have a [circle with a C in it], . . .
