So many people have quoted the book, "Legal Care for Your Software", that
I think we should take a look at this book.  A lot of the things quoted are
opposite of what I learned in school too.  Not to say that the author is
in error, but who is he anyways?  Is he a lawyer?  I think that if I had a
stake in the matter, I wouldn't trust anyone short of a patent lawyer to
give me the answer....
