	Right.  It is a little confusing.  If you put a source out
on the net and say that anyone can use it any way they want, it is
public domain and there is no copyright.    The reference I have
assumes that you want to protect your software and does not
go into great detail about how to give it away.    If you put
it on the net and say that it is copyrighted (you might even have
registered it with the copyright office) is it still copyrighted?
From the way the book reads it is, though I cannot figure out
what restrictions would apply (the book is "Legal Care For Your
Software, Nolo Press - 1984).
