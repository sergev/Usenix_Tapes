	It appears the experts disagree.  The stuff I typed in above
came from "Legal Care For Your Software", by Daniel Remer, Nolo Press
(C) 1984.

	My lawyer and the lawyers for the company I am currently 
writing software for (Hewlett-Packard) insist on BOTH the (C) and
the word "Copyright."   The (C) is an international symbol, recognized
in countries that do not use English.

	One reason to put a copyright notice in source you post
to the net is to establish that you have a legitimate right to
give it away.   

	I recently sold some software and a good portion of the
license was a warantee that I owned it and had the right to sell it.
