LEGAL CARE FOR YOUR SOFTWARE is by Daniel Remer, an attorney in the SF
Bay Area. He is a recognized expert on computer law and copyright
matters. I met him when he conducted a panel discussion on Computer
Software Law at the American Bar Association Annual Meeting in San
Francisco in 1982.  Though software copyright law remains in a state of
flux, LEGAL CARE is authentic and trustworthy, and I used it as a
sourcebook/formbook when I practiced law in that area. Dan Remer has
also worked as a software developer and his knowledge of the field is
significant.
