I never said you couldn't!  The problem is in the proposed wording of
the posted copyright notice. "Public domain" legally means the
copyright is owned by the public.  And while you do indeed
automatically own copyright while the work is unpublished, if you
publish the software (or anything else) without copyright notice, you
have just donated it to the public domain.
