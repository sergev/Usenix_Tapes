	He is right, I am wrong.  The book I was getting the
info from actually says: "For a work to be in the public
domain and therefor not copyrightable, it must be published
in such a way that it looses its copyright protection.  Suppose
that Tom published an object code listing (in hex, assembly language,
or binary) of JunkMail in *Gulp* magazine along with the suggestion
than anyone wishing to use it could do so. By doing this
Tom has put JunkMail in the public domain.  Another way of
allowing a work to fall into the public domain is to 
publish it without a copyright notice and fail to rectify
this within the next five years." [p. 28]

	If you fail to rectify it in the next five years.

	Perhaps this is so.  It is a requirement that has nothing
to do with copyrights though.
