Dear Netters,

Due to recent requests for Date and Julian Date routines, I  went
back thru my archives and dug up these three items.  Please note,
I did *not* write these (except for the  Makefile).  Jdate.c  and
jday.c  were:   Author:   Robert  G.   Tantzen,  translator:  Nat
Howard.  I don't know who did day.c (will the real author  please
stand up).
