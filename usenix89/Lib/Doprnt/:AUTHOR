Mark Pulver is looking for a C version of _doprnt, so I thought
I'd pass mine along.  I wrote this from the ground up; it is
absolutely underived from anything proprietary.

This version is not complete, and has the following two key
omissions:

	It doesn't do floating point (%f, %e, or %g).

	It will handle %ld (%lx, etc.) incorrectly on machines
	where sizeof(long) != sizeof(int).

It also does not implement the %# stuff which appeared in the 4.2
documentation but which I haven't seen in any implementation yet.

I believe it handles everything else correctly, although I have
not tested it exhaustively.

There are two "fun" additions: %b is binary, and %r is roman.

You are free to use this code as you wish, but please leave the
identification comment intact.  I can offer no support for this
code, although if I ever implement floating point or pdp11
support (I'm acutely embarrassed to admit making the typical VAX
int/long equivalence assumption) I'll try to remember to post
those additions.
