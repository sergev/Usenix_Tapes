Here are the routines that I talked about in net.lang.c.  They are
barely commented, and tested on XENIX on an IBM-PC/AT, ULTRIX-11 on
a PDP-11 and UNIX system V on a Microforce 1a.  Do with as ye may.
I do ask that if you make changes, please do not distribute them
as different versions will confuse people.  Notify me, and if the changes
are appropriate, I will post a new version.
