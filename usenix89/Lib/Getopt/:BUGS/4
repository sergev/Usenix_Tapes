All this is based in getopt from AT&T Unix Sys III and up:

Agreed that getopt cannot handle '+' type command flags, BUT -- it can indeed
handle the trailing tx mentioned above, it ignores whitespace between switches
that do not require arguments, and it does NOT ignore argument order.  Sounds
to me like you have an inferior, 'non-standard' getopt.

Again, 'real' getopt will accept all of the above combinations of -s and -g
above.  Agreed, it does add somewhat to the size of your program -- but since
I write microassemblers and compilers that generally have 15-20 command-line
switches I don't really mind -- it buys me a lot of clarity.  Also, I am on
a Vax 11/780 with 10 meg main memory   :-)
