Maybe with a bit of change in the command line syntax, it would be amenable
to getopt.  Remember, that there is nothing keeping the same flag from being
used more than once:

   connect -s 1200 -n 4445555,4446666 -s300 -n 5556666,6667777 -l tty1 direct

If you MUST keep the original syntax (mixing flags with nonflag arguments)
you can still use getopt with a little bit of shimming.  Just increment
optind (presuming it is still smaller than argc) after getopt has returned
EOF, check that the first character of the corresponding argument is a '-'
(i.e., another flag, else handle the argument specially) then jump back
into the loop calling getopt.  It's still cleaner looking inside the program
than a brute force parse.

Of course someone is going to ask what if the argument was supposed to begin
with '-' and it is not a flag.  Oh well, life ain't easy....
