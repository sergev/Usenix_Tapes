Not this again!

The most standard version I can think of is the one with System V.  IT CAN
PARSE "sort -mubdfnicrtx" JUST FINE.  And it certainly is not only AVAILABLE,
it is in the public domain.

You are confusing the "Proposed Syntax Standard for UNIX System Commands"
with getopt(3C).  Getopt only enforces SOME of those rules.  In particular,
it does NOT enforce Rule 6: "The first option-argument following an option
must be preceded by white space" or Rule 5: "Options with no arguments may
be grouped behind one delimiter."  That is, it allows options with arguments
to be grouped with other options.  The getopt man page doesn't say much at
all about whitespace, except for this: "if a letter is followed by a colon,
the option is expected to have an argument that may or may not be separated
from it by white space."  That's what you want, RIGHT?

This is not a problem.  Use the documented optind external variable:

	while (optind < argc)
		switch (getopt(argc, argv, "s:l:")) {
		case 's':
			speed = atoi(optarg);
			break;
		case 'l':
			strcpy(line, optarg);
			break;
		default:
			call(argv[optind++], speed, line);
			break;
		}

In fact, this is how getopt is used for System V cc.  Also, you said
something about getopt ignoring the order of arguments.  Again, you're
confusing the Proposed Syntax with getopt!  Getopt just returns you the
options in the order they were given and you can do whatever you want
with them!!

But it's not anything to worry about.  It doesn't use stdio, and it is
smaller than, e.g., atof, qsort, malloc, crypt, and ctime.

I really wish you would read things more carefully and not get all
worked up over situations that don't exist.  Nearly everything you've
said about getopt has been just plain WRONG.
