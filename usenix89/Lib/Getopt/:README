The getopt available through the AT&T Toolchest is identical to the
source released at the Dallas 1985 UniForum, except that it contains
(past tense?) a notice about declaring it to be "unpublished
proprietary source code of AT&T" -- you go figure it out.

Anyhow here's the public version, as published in comp.std.unix (nee
mod.std.unix) and mod.sources (soon to be comp.sources.unix) some time
ago.

If someone would write a public-domain manpage, that'd be great.

Here's something you've all been waiting for:  the AT&T public domain
source for getopt(3).  It is the code which was given out at the 1985
UNIFORUM conference in Dallas.  I obtained it by electronic mail
directly from AT&T.  The people there assure me that it is indeed
in the public domain.

There is no manual page.  That is because the one they gave out at
UNIFORUM was slightly different from the current System V Release 2
manual page.  The difference apparently involved a note about the
famous rules 5 and 6, recommending using white space between an option
and its first argument, and not grouping options that have arguments.
Getopt itself is currently lenient about both of these things:  White
space is allowed, but not mandatory, and the last option in a group can
have an argument.  That particular version of the man page evidently
has no official existence, and my source at AT&T did not send a copy.
The current SVR2 man page reflects the actual behavor of this getopt.
However, I am not about to post a copy of anything licensed by AT&T.
