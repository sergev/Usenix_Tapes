[ eat this, line eater ]

A few weeks ago I posted a request to the net for a public domain version
of scandir().

Well....., I got no takers so I hacked my own. Since it is used in the pathalias
software I have decided to release it to the net.

Also included is a small test program which will demonstrate the routine.


Have fun and enjoy, all flames to /dev/null, all praise to me at
