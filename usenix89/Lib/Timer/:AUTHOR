The shell archive below contains a library for manipulating timers.
If you have some real time application this package might come in handy.
It uses ftime(2), so if your system lacks this, you'll have to modify the
source.  However, the module should run without modification on BSD 4.1,
2.9 and old Version 7 UNIX.
