[food for line eater]

Craig  Milo  Rogers  asked (in Info-IBMPC) if anyone had a better ATTRIB
command.  Here it is! I know there are plenty of these  around,  but  he
did  ask  and  in  any case this one is upward-compatible with the DOS 3
version.

Perhaps someone could feed this to Info-IBMPC; I can't do it from here.
