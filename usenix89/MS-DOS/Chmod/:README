There seems to have been sufficient demand to warrant a posting
of the current version of chmod - the previously posted version
had a bug that allowed directory attribs to be changed only with
the '=' option. This has been fixed and the uuencoded arc file is
below.

1) The top of the doc follows :-

CHMOD(1)                    MS DOS USER COMMANDS                    CHMOD(1)

NAME 
     chmod

SYNOPSIS 
     chmod [=+-][r][h][s][a] file ...

DESCRIPTION 
    
       Changes the attributes of 'file'. The file attributes can either 
  be set (=),  or attributes can  be added (+)  or removed (-) from the
  the current attribute. If no attributes  are specified, then the file
  is marked 'normal' i.e. no attributes set except the archive bit.

2) Below is a uuencoded chmod.arc which contains 
     a) chmod.doc 
     b) chmod.exe
     c) chmod.c (source code for Microsoft C) 

3) To get the goodies, save the uuencode file and use uudecode to get
   the arc file which can then be downloaded using any binary transfer
   program.
