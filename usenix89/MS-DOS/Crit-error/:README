The following is a MS-DOS critical error handler for C.  It is written
for Microsoft C, but should work with any compiler provided that the
assembly file crit.asm is edited to conform with local segment and public
naming conventions.

A MS-DOS critical error is when an I/O error occurs that puts you at a
prompt "abort, retry, ignore".  In the absence of a handler, if you select
abort, you get dumped back at the DOS prompt.  With the handler, control
returns to your program if an error has occured, where it can be dealt with
more gracefully.
