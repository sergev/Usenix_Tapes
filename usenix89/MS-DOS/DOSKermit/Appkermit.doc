                                 UPDATES FOR APPLE DOS KERMIT

       0.1.  New commands

            These new commands have been added:
            1. LOG
            When connected to a remote site, log the remote sessions  printing  to  the
       specified file. The file type and file warning protocols are observed. This com-
       mand is dependent upon the flow control (xon&xoff) working. Without flow control
       there  is  little possibility of getting a correct copy of the terminal session.
       The loging begins when you connect to the remote and is terminated when you  es-
       cape back to the local kermit with the ESCAPE character followed by the "C" com-
       mand.
            2. SET PRINTER
            This allows one to turn the printer on for printing what  is  displayed  on
       the  screen.  With  all the different printers and printer cards there will be a
       lot of variability here but flow control (xon&xoff) is  probably  required  when
       you  are  connected to a remote site. The printer can also be toggled on/off via
       the ESCAPE character followed by the command "P"
            3. SET FLOW
            This allows one to use the xon&xoff protocol when you are  connected  to  a
       remote site. Delay timings and wake up timings are part of this command. Setting
       the  timings will have to be set by experience.  Perhaps the best way to set the
       timings is to bring the values down until you get failures and then  double  the
       timing figure.  Both LOG and SET PRINTER will probably depend on flow control.
            4. SET DISPLAY 80-COLUMN
            This allows one to specify a 80 column display. Several  commands  are  re-
       quired for the 80 column display to work correctly:
           $0a - line feed, move cursor down one line
           $0b - vt, clear screen from cursor down
           $0c - form feed, clear screen and position to top left
           $16 - syn, reverse scroll the screen
               - this command necessary only for vt52 emulation
           $1c - nak, move cursor right one
           $1d - gs, clear line from cursor to the right
           $1e,ch,cv - 3 chs in a row position cursor to ch & cv
                     - ch & cv each have a bias of 32
            5. SET BAUD
            This command allows you to set the baud rate of your com card  if  the  com
       card allows it.
       0.2.  Syntax of the commands

            1. LOG filespec
            Filespec is the name  of  a  file  on  the  micro  that  will  receive  the
       characters  received from the remote. All the characters from the remote will be
                                               1

                                 UPDATES FOR APPLE DOS KERMIT

       recorded in the file except carrage return followed by line feed which  will  be
       reduced to a carrage return.
            2. SET PRINTER {on/off/slot} number
                 ON - turn the printer on, slot number is required
                 OFF - turn the printer off
                 SLOT number - printer card is in slot "number"
            3. SET FLOW {off/xon/delay/wakeup} number
                 OFF - turn off flow control
                 XON - turn on xon&xoff flow control with the remote
                 DELAY number - delay the micro til xoff takes effect
                 WAKEUP number - restart the remote with a xon
            Delay followed by number(including 0) delays the program  for  number  mil-
       liseconds  after  the xoff is given to the remote. This delay allows the xoff to
       take effect before the program continues. Wakeup followed by a  number(including
       0) is used to wake the remote up number milliseconds after the xoff has been gi-
       ven by giving the remote a xon.
            4. ESCAPE {p/c/s/?/0/b/d/ESCAPE}
            While connected to the remote the ESCAPE character followed by one  of  the
       following produces:
            ? - display this list of options
            B - transmit a break signal to the remote
            C - close the connection with the remote and return to micro
            D - drop the phone line to the remote
            P - toggle the printer on/off
            S - give status of current connect
            0 - transmit a null to the remote
            ESCAPE - transmit the ESCAPE character to the remote
            5. SET DISPLAY 80-COLUMN number
            Number is the slot the 80 column card is in.
            6. SET BAUD number
            Number is the baud rate for your com card. For the super serial it  can  be
       300 to 19200.  Notice the com card is handled from within kermit for most every-
       thing we can think of.
       0.3.  Vt52 emulation

            Vt52 emulation has been reworked and should work much better,though slower.
       One thing that is required is your 80 column card must handle the $16 command in
       order for reverse scrolling to work. The //e 80 col handles this fine.
            If you are on a un*x system then it would be better and faster to  use  one
       of the following termcaps and leave vt52 emulation off.

       0.4.  Problems with loosing characters.

            Interupt driven com cards have the best chance of working without  loss  of
       characters.  However,  due to the way apple handles the writing of diskettes and
       the many unthinking programers who have written proms that  lock  out  interupts
       for  all kinds of peripheral cards xon&xoff flow control is almost a requirement
       for the higher baud rates. The //e is especialy vulnerable, I  have  seen  ][+'s
       with  non  apple  80  col  displays that work fine at 9600 baud without fail and
       without flow control.
       0.5.  Com card drivers

            Kermit 3 has now been separated into two assemblies. The main routines  and
       the com card routines. A vector has been set up in low memory for the two assem-
       blies  to communicate. Look at the working com drivers for tips on how to incor-
       porate your version of the com driver. some things to note: It is probably  best
                                               3

                                 UPDATES FOR APPLE DOS KERMIT

       to  buffer the input from the remote and to get input characters from the remote
       every chance you get. Note the Microtek VS-622 driver,  whenever  the  input  is
       checked for a character and has a character the character is put into the buffer
       immeadiatly. Also when the output is checked for ready to output, if the card is
       not ready to output then it is checked for a character to input. All this should
       help prevent loosing character.
       0.6.  Loading kermit 3

            The main problem exists in getting the hex files onto your  disketts  as  a
       text file. But again that is a test of your creativity. If you have a version of
       kermit  running then GET or RECIEVE the file as a text file and you are in busi-
       ness.  We have separated the main routine into two separate files for mail  pur-
       poses so EXEC each of the main routines. Use ctrlC cr to get out of monitor back
       to  basic  for  each  EXEC.  Your apple (or compatable) will go into monitor and
       show you *'s for several minutes. This is  the  monitor  loading  the  hex  into
       binary.  If  you get beeps from the monitor its probably because you didnt get a
       good copy of the text file.  Now EXEC the com card driver you are going to  use.
       You  will  have to get back into basic(aha another test for you,try-ctrlC cr) to
       do this. And you will see the monitor loading  the  com  driver.  The  order  of
       EXEC's  is  important.   The com card should be loaded last.  Next get back into
       basic and do a "BSAVE kermitname,A$1000,L$5800" You  may  have  to  specify  the
       drive  to  do this binary save, with a slot or drive on the end of the BSAVE(aha
       another test).  You now run kermit via "BRUN kermitname"
            If you want to customize kermit for your equipment. Do all your "set's" etc
       and then do an "exit". Now you should be back in  basic.  At  this  point  do  a
       "BSAVE  name,A$1000,L$5800" and when you do a "BRUN name" all your setup will be
       remembered.
            Since the org is now $1000 if you have been using kermit and then went back
       to basic for some trivial thing (like catalog) a "CALL  4096"  should  start  up
       kermit without having to reload it.
            Appreciate bug reports, problems and comments.
