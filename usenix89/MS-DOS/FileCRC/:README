The following is a pair of programs to calculate the CRC's of all the files on 
a disk, and to compare this list to a previously generated list.
This allows you to keep track of files that have been added, deleted,
modified, or trashed.  The programs are written to be compiled under
TURBO Pascal (ver 3.0, although I haven't tried earlier versions).  See
