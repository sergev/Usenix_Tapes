	VENIX SysVr2 Hardware Clock Routines for a Multi Function card clock
	====================================================================

				(for PCompatibles)
	
	Vanilla Venix contains a /dev/clock to set the Hard Ware Clock,
	but this device does not seem to work on a multi function card
	clock.

	Here are two commands, setclock, to set the HW clock and systime
	to read it.

	This code is hereby placed into the public domain.

	almost forgot ...

	setclock		sets HW clock to localtime
	sysdate			prints HW date in asci format
	sysdate -		prints HW date in mmddhhmm format

	put in your /etc/startup file:

	date `sysdate -`

	(and, IF anyone is gonna write a man page, I'd like one too)
