          The accompanying program is a front end to the INT 10 (VIDEO)
        functions of the DOS BIOS, so that the important functions work
        on a Hercules graphics board or its clones. (It was developed on
        a SuperComputer clone of a Hercules) It is a
        terminate-and-stay-resident program, that is installed by being
        called; it is NOT a DOS driver. If you want it installed at boot,
        include it in AUTOEXEC.BAT, not CONFIG.SYS.

        The major strength of this program is that it will allow you to
        write programs for the Hercules board that run in graphics mode,
        and still write text easily on the graphics screen. With it, you
        can program in those higher-level language processors that use
        the DOS or BIOS calls for display, using their standard I/O calls
        to write text to the graphics screen. (For a list of known
        compatible and incompatible languages, see the section later in
        this manual.)

        A second use of this program is to allow the running of existing
        graphics programs that use the BIOS calls for ALL screen display.
        It will NOT allow most commercial graphics programs written for
        the the Color Graphics Adapter (CGA) to run on the Hercules
        board. That is because most graphics programs write directly to
        the video memory instead of using the BIOS calls. The only
        existing graphics program that this has been tested against is
        PC-LISP; that is the only graphics program I've encountered that
        uses the BIOS exclusively.

        HERCBIOS is a terminate-and-stay-resident program that intercepts
        all calls to Interrupt 10H, the BIOS video services. It will
        either process the interrupt or pass the call on to the real
        BIOS, depending on whether something specific to the Hercules
        board needs to be done. Specifically, HERCBIOS handles the
        interrupt itself if (1) the board is in graphics mode, or (2) the
        BIOS call is a request to enter graphics mode.

        Two graphics modes are recognized and processed by HERCBIOS:

             _M_o_d_e _6 - _I_B_M _H_i-_r_e_s _m_o_d_e:  This uses part of the 720x348
             Hercules raster as a 640x200 IBM-compatible graphics screen.
             It will work with programs for the IBM CGA and its clones,
             provided they use the BIOS services for their graphics
             display. (Note - such programs are rare.)

             _M_o_d_e _8 - _H_e_r_c_u_l_e_s-_s_p_e_c_i_f_i_c _m_o_d_e:  This uses the full

                                      - 1 -








             Hercules raster.

        Actually, both modes are quite capable of putting a pixel
        anywhere on the Hercules raster.  The major difference is that
        Mode 6 draws characters in an 8x8 pixel box (like the CGA), while
        Mode 8 uses the finer resolution of the Hercules board to improve
        legibility by using a 12x8 pixel box for characters. In either
        mode, more characters than 25x80 will fit on the screen. Mode 6
        supports 43x90 characters on the screen (but 25x80 inside the
        640x200-pixel sub-screen); Mode 8 supports 29x90 characters.

        The functions implemented by HERCBIOS are:

                Fn  0 - Set mode (6, 7, or 8)
                Fn  2 - Set cursor position
                Fn  3 - Read cursor position
                Fn  5 - New display page
                Fn  9 - Write character with attribute
                Fn 10 - Write character
                Fn 12 - Write pixel
                Fn 13 - Read pixel
                Fn 14 - Teletypewriter-style character write
                Fn 15 - Get video status

        Check your System Programmers' Guide for the use of these BIOS
        functions.

        A number of properties of the alphanumeric display are not
        supported by the hardware when you enter graphics mode. For
        instance, the cursor is not shown in graphics mode, nor are all
        of the character attributes. HERCBIOS does its best to emulate
        the alphanumeric mode, but it cannot implement a cursor or the
        blinking or bold attributes. The table below shows the "best
        shot" that HERCBIOS takes at character attributes:

                CODE    USUALLY MEANS           IBM MODE        HERC MODE
                00      invisible               invisible       invisible
                01      underline               [normal]        underline
                07      normal                  normal          normal
                0F      hi-intens               [rev video]     [rev video]
                70      rev video               rev video       rev video


                Anything else displays as normal

        The teletypewriter-style output protects the bottom line on the
        screen as an unscrolled line, for status messages, function key
        labels, etc. This is non-standard, but I like it. (And we do have
        more rows than the CGA display. It's the 43rd line that isn't
        scrolled.)

        HERCBIOS was originally developed on ASM 1.0. The version
        included with this uses MASM 4.0. I don't know for sure whether
        it will assemble with other versions of assembler.

        The commands for making HERCBIOS.COM from the source are in the
        MAKEFILE included with the distribution. I run it with NDMAKE, an
        excellent MS-DOS shareware MAKE from Don Knellers, but it should
        be easy to adapt to your own favorite MAKE. If you make it by
        hand, the commands are:

                masm  hercbios;
                masm  gchar;
                masm  graph;
                link  hercbios gchar graph,  hercbios.exe;
                exe2bin  hercbios.exe hercbios.com
                del  hercbios.exe

        If you have a machine whose processor is an iAPX 286, 186, or
        188, you may be able to get some increased performance and a
        smaller .COM file by editing one character in the header file
        _h_e_r_c_b_i_o_s._h. Simply remove the ";" that comments out the
        definition of _i_A_P_X_2_8_6. That will allow some non-8088 instructions
        to assemble, as well as changing some code that was optimized for
        speed (at the expense of storage and beauty) on the 8088. (This
        option is known to assemble and link, but has not been tested; I
        have no access to a 286 machine with Hercules graphics.)

        Once you have HERCBIOS.COM, store it where your PATH will find it
        and add the line

                HERCBIOS

        to your AUTOEXEC.BAT file somewhere after the PATH command. This
        will cause it to be installed during boot, so it will be there
        whenever you run your graphics programs. (Its presence won't
        affect operation of your computer in alphanumeric mode, since it
        passes on to the normal BIOS anything that's not in graphics
        mode.)

        I am including a couple of demonstration/test programs in this
        distribution, so that you can:
           - See how to write programs for HERCBIOS.
           - Test to assure that it runs with your computer and monitor.
        The programs can be run in their executable form and their source
        can be examined.

        HERCBIOS has been tested on a Hercules board in an IBM PC-XT, a
        Hercules-compatible board I built from a SuperComputer bare
        board, and a Leading Edge XT clone. The current version works
        with all of these, but I have a homebrew monitor that has trouble
        syncing to the higher sweep rate of the monochrome display. If
        you have trouble with the stability of your image, try fiddling
        with the parameters for the 6845 display chip. They are in the
        file _H_E_R_C_B_I_O_S._A_S_M, in the "db" statement defining _v_i_d__p_a_r_m__t_a_b_l_e
        at the end of Function 0 (Set Video Mode). I have left in (but
        commented out) the set of parameters that works on my homebrew
        monitor.

        I have written programs using HERCBIOS in a number of languages.
        Here are some of the caveats I'd like to pass on:

          - Things are fine using INT 10h calls in assembler.  (No big
            surprise.)

          - Turbo Pascal works with HERCBIOS, with one caveat (at least
            for releases 1 and 2). The Pascal cursor function GoTOXY will
            home the cursor if presented with x>80 or y>25. To make full
            use of the 29x90 or 43x90 screen, you will have to write your
            own version of GoTOXY, using Turbo's machine language escape
            to issue the INT 10h.

          - I've written a little in Microsoft C 3.0. No problems so far.

          - The TESTPIX program was written in deSmet C 2.4. It worked
            fine, with one caveat. The console I/O routine _g_e_t_c_h_a_r()
            seems to write to display memory (perhaps as part of keyboard
            echo). This can interfere with what is displayed on the
            Hercules board display page 1.  (I had no problems on page
            0.)

          - Forget about using it with BASICA or GWBASIC. Microsoft BASIC
            graphics routines write directly to display memory,
            completely bypassing the BIOS.


        USE AND ENJOY!
