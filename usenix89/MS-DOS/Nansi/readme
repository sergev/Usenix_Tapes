This package includes the source code for nansi.sys, an improved
console driver for MS-DOS running on IBM PC computers or their clones,
a makefile for how to assemble it, a uuencoded copy of the assembled
(executable) driver, documentation describing the driver, and a short 
demo program (uuencoded) to show off its strong point: very rapid
screen updates from multi-character write operations.

The demo program takes a single argument on the command line; it should
be the filename of a text file.  It then displays the first 24 text lines
from the file on the console screen and quits.  Try it first with your
current console driver (e.g. ansi.sys), then install the executable
copy of nansi.sys in its place and run demo again on the same text file.

I think the author of nansi.sys did us all a tremendous favor.
