	I have just posted a LISP interpreter for MS-DOS called PC-LISP.
It runs a subset of Franz lisp. It consists of three files:

	lisp.doc	- A manual
	extfunc.l	- A set of function definitions and a demo.
	pc-lisp.uuu	- The uuencoded binary. A 112K .exe file.

	This interpreter is the result of 1 and a half years of work,
it has full garbage collection and heap management. It allows lambda,
nlambda and macro bodies, will run prog's, has types float, alpha, list 
and port. It incorporates shallow binding techniques for O(1) symbol
lookup. It has access to the MS-DOS BIOS graphics routines. The demo
is a small Turtle Graphics routine. It has full error detection   
including stack overflow. It has one break level from which you can
analyze bindings at the point of error, show the stack up to the
point of error, or trace a functions execution. It requires 256K but
runs best with 512 or a full 640K. 

	The three parts have been posted to net.sources
