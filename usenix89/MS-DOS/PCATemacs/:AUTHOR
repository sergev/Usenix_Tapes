This is a copy of MicroEmacs that was posted over the net about 
2 months ago.  I ported it to an PC-AT.  I added Meta-X commands
and  added "Replace-String" and "Query-Replace".

	I will not support this version of MicroEmacs for the AT.
	So have fun. It's all here and you just have to break it
	into modules and compile it.
