Okay everybody, I have been seeing a lot of griping about how
PC-SHELL is incompatible with memory-resident programs, and I feel I should
defend myself.

I DO NOT do anything weird that makes all those programs go bonko - My
program is as portable as it could be to ANY machine running MS-DOS.
I have traced the problem to the fact that I get a line of input by this
insidious subtrefuge :

char *getline(buf)
char *buf;
{
     char *bp = buf;
     char c;
     while (0 != read(0,&c,1) && strchr("\r\n",c) == NULL)
	*bp++ = c;
     *bp = '\0'; /* terminate string */
     if (c == '\r') /* we stopped at carriage return - need to eat newline */
	read(0,&c,1);
     return (bp == buf) ? NULL : buf;
}

If you can think of a more vanilla way to do input from standard input under
ms-dos, you let me know.

Apparently the MS-DOS console device does not do the hootenany B.S. that
resident programs expect - so the problem is NOT my incompatibility with
resident programs, but rather DOS's incompatibility with them under the
abover circumstances.

I will work on the problem, OK???

As for those who have called my program a 'naive implementation', go write 
your own, and come back 3 months later and talk to me.

The NEXT version you see on the net will be rewritten from the ground up -
I am reverse-engineering csh from the Xenix V.2 documentation.  If any 
Berkeley Purists out there want it to be any more c-shell like, they can
send me the manual page for the berkeley C-Shell.

For those of you who got corrupted copies of the last posting, send me
a disk and a mailer to

For those of you who expressed disdainful opinions of my program, keep in
mind the effort that went into it, with little assurance of any reward.  I
estimate that my financial return per copies in use right now is about
25 cents a copy.
