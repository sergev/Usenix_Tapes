DOCUMENTATION FOR PC-SHELL
This file is 'entabbed' for a tabstop of 8 characters width.  If you have a
printer that can't handle tabs, you will have to sed the tabs out of it.
There is a second part of this posting that contains the uuencoded binary of
PC-SHELL.COM.  You need to get that also, uudecode it, and download it onto
your PC WITH SOME SORT OF BINARY FILE TRANSFER PROTOCOL!!!
