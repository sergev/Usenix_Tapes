Summary: An example of how to set the typamatic rate on an IBM PC
Posted: Mon May 12 16:12:19 1986


Here is the source to a program that can be used to alter the typamatic
rate on an IBM PC.  It doesn't work on an AT&T 6300+ and possibly other
compatibles.  It's supplied as an example to illustrate how the typamatic
rate can be altered.  This is in response to a query in net.micro.pc
