OK. I finally got this thing uploaded & uuencoded. I haven't been able
to download it back to the PC and run it, but I'm 99.99% sure that that's
because of problems with the xmodem download program I'm using, since the
file when downloaded is about 20K shorter than the original. If this thing
doesn't run, shoot me.

The following is the uuencoded form of smartty, a smart terminal program
that emulates VT100, VT52, ADM3A, and TVI912 terminals. It is also pretty
nearly modeless: the keyboard is always live, for instance...
