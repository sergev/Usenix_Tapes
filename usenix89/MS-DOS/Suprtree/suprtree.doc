SUPRTREE is a utility that analyzes the space allocation of a
disk on a directory-by-directory basis.  It is useful in
tracking down what (or who) is hogging space on a disk.

SUPRTREE is free.  You can use it without charge.  You can
give it to anyone you like.  You cannot sell it.  SUPRTREE is
not guaranteed to satisfy your particular needs, and it
almost certainly has some bugs.  If you find any bugs or
implement any improvements, I would appreciate your letting
me know.

SUPRTREE produces output that gives a listing of the entire
subdirectory tree of the root directory or any subdirectory.
All subdirectories are listed, and, at the users option,
files can be listed as well.  For each directory, SUPRTREE
lists the number of bytes occupied by the contents (files and
subdirectories) of that directory.  It also provides this
figure as a percentage of the space occupied by all
successive ancestors of that directory.  If you choose to
list files, SUPRTREE lists the space occupied by each file on
the disk and provides that figure as a percentage of the
file's ancestor directories.  SUPRTREE lists all files,
hidden or not, and tells you if a file is a read-only,
system, or hidden file.

Using SUPRTREE is easy.  If you want to list directories
only on Drive C, issue the command

     SUPRTREE C:\

If you want to list both files and directories, issue the
command

     SUPRTREE C:\ /F

If you want the listing on your printer, simply redirect the
output to the printer; SUPRTREE C:\ >PRN: or SUPRTREE C:\ /F
>PRN:.  Other options are explained below.

SUPRTREE OUTPUT

Reading SUPRTREE output is more difficult that obtaining that
output.  A short listing is shown below.

------------------------------------------------------------

      directory   subdirectory           on disk

2 directories.
8 files.
 101376 bytes used.
 261120 bytes left
 362496 bytes on disk
------------------------------------------------------------

The first line gives the volume label, DEMO VOLUME, and the
number of bytes, 101376, in use on the disk.  The second and
third lines list two file, FEEFIEFO.FUM and FOOFILE.FIL, in
the root directory.  The figure to the left of FEEFIEFO.FUM
indicate that it occupies 2.02% of of the 101,376 bytes in
use on the disk (not 2.02% of the total disk capacity).  The
corresponding figure is 39.39% for FOOFILE.FIL.  The figures
to the right of these two files are the actual numbers of
bytes occupied by these files.  Thus, FOOFILE.FIL takes up
39,936 bytes on the disk.  (Note that this figure is
probably larger than the file length.  See the QUESTIONS
section below for an explanation.)

The third line lists a subdirectory, FOOBAR, of the root
directory.  This subdirectory contains the four files listed
in the 4th-7th lines.  FOOBAR, and the four files in it, take
up a total of 48,128 bytes or 47.47% of the space in use on
the disk.

There are two percentage figures to the left of DOPEY.DWF
(and to the left of the other three files as well).  The
first figure (13.13) is the percentage of space in use on the
disk that is occupied by DOPEY.DWF.  The second (27.66) is
the percentage of the 48,128 bytes tied up in FOOBAR that is
used by DOPEY.DWF.  The actual number of bytes occupied by
DOPEY is 13,312, as is shown to the right of the entry.
The 8th line, and those following it, list similar
information for the second subdirectory (SLITHEY) on the
disk.

If we nested subdirectories three deep on the disk, the
SUPRTREE listing of each third-level entry would have three
figures to its left, giving the percentage of space occupied
by that entry in the root directory, the first subdirectory,
and the parent directory of the entry.  In general, to find
the percentage of Entry E in Subdirectory S, look at the
figure in ROW where Entry E is listed and the COLUMN where
Subdirectory S is listed.

Although there are no hidden files on the DEMO VOLUME,
SUPRTREE lists all files hidden or not.  And it will mark
read-only, system, and hidden files with an R, S, or H after
the filename.

SUPRTREE OPTIONS

SUPRTREE listings can be tailored using various paramaters
and switches on the command line.  For example, putting C:\
on the command line tells SUPRTREE to start the tree at the
root directory of Drive C:.  Putting /F on the command line
tells SUPRTREE to list files as well as directories.  THESE
SWITCHES AND OPTIONS MUST BE SEPARATED BY TABS OR SPACES.
Here is a full explanation of all of the options.

     d:path

SUPRTREE normally uses the current drive and pathname as a
starting point for its tree.  You can get SUPRTREE to start
at any drive and/or directory by putting the corresponding
drive:path on the command line.


     /Dn or /D

SUPRTREE does not normally list entries in directories more
than six levels deep; if it did, the listing would exceed the
80 columns available on most displays and printers.  To
change this DEPTH limit to any other number (between 1 and
100), use the /Dn option.  For example, you could put your
printer in compressed print mode and use /D9.  Or, you could
limit your listing to the root directory by using /D1.  To
change the limit to the maximum (100), use /D.  SUPRTREE
always looks at the entire disk to compute its usage figures.
Using /D only affects the listing, not the computations.


     /F or /FM

SUPRTREE normally lists only the directories on the disk.  If
you use /F, SUPRTREE will list the FILES in each directory
before listing its subdirectories.  If you use /FM, the files
and the subdirectories will be MERGED into a single list.
The content of the listing under /F is the same as that under
/FM, but the order in which the entries are listed is
different.


     /H

If you use /H, SUPRTREE, instead of generating a listing,
will display a HELP screen summarizing these options.


     /S

Normally, SUPRTREE lists in alphabetical order.  If you want
to see the big entries first, use /S on the command line.
This will cause SUPRTREE to list entries in decreasing order
of SIZE.


     >filename

You can direct SUPRTREE output to any file or device.  For
example, you can use >PRN: to direct output to your printer.


QUESTIONS

1.  How come the sizes given in SUPRTREE listings are almost
always larger than the file sizes given in directory
listings?

SUPRTREE lists the number of bytes occupied by the file on
the disk.  The directory lists the number of bytes of data in
the file.  These two numbers are not the same because files
are stored in hunks of uniform size called clusters.  If, for
example a file has, 5.003 clusters-worth of data, DOS will
still use up 6 clusters on the disk to store the file.  Since
SUPRTREE is a tool to help you deal with disk space
allocation, it tells you how much space your files take on
the disk.

2.  How come, when I add up the percentages of all the
entries in a subdirectory, I come out with a sum that is
short of 100?  And, when I add up the sizes of all the
entries in a subdirectory, I come up short of the size listed
for the subdirectory?

The subdirectory itself takes up a certain amount of space on
the disk.  As near as I can tell, each directory is allocated
one cluster, but there is nothing in the DOS manual
documenting this assertion.

3.  I ran CHKDSK and SUPRTREE on the same disk.  They both
list the disk capacity, the amount in use, and the number of
files.  How come the figures don't match.

Beats me.  Must be something wrong with CHKDSK. (Seriously,
the figures from the two programs should match.)

IMPLEMENTATION NOTES

SUPRTREE is written TURBO PASCAL Version 3.0.  If you have
the COM file version, you don't need to worry about this.  If
you want to mess around with the code, you should know that
it uses features of TURBO available only in Version 3.0.
