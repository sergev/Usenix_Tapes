Another bit of 3-part music for the holiday season.  Again,
gather.com will ask for a tempo value which should be 10-12 for
4.7mh PCs, 8-9 for 7-8mh PCs, and 0 to 2 for ATs.  Too high
a value for ATs can crash them.  The program cannot work
properly without clearing interrupts while the song is
actually being played...  sorry about that.
