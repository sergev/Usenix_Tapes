# This is nasty.  It goes out and finds all the people that are actually users
# on the machine from the /etc/passwd file, and then looks to see if they have
# root directories.  If they do, then it loops, checking about once every two
# minutes, to see if anyone in that list doesn't have mail.  If they don't then
# it mails them garbage.  If you are really clever, you can go out and find a
# setuid program somewhere that you might be able to cajole into sending the
# mail for you so that nobody knows where it came from.

# This is a bourne shell script, not a csh script.
#
# If there are any arguments on the command line, then those are the only
# people that will get mail ad nauseum.
