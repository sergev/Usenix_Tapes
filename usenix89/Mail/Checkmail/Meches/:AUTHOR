CHECKMAIL(1)     Local UNIX Programmer's Manual      CHECKMAIL(1)



NAME
     checkmail - check the status of your and others mail

SYNOPSIS
     checkmail [ -q ] [ user ... ]

DESCRIPTION
     checkmail tells whether you have, mail (old mail), new mail,
     no mail, or no mailbox on the machine it is executed on.

     By default, checkmail only reports the status of your mail-
     box, it returns a status of one if you have new mail and
     zero otherwise.  If you specify a list of users, it tells
     you the state of their mailbox(s).

     If you have a .hushlogin file, it defeats mail checking on
     login.  This program can then be used to re-instate this. It
     can also check your mail on login, and if you have new mail
     start up a mail job in the background with the following in
     your .login file.

          checkmail
          if ($status != 0) then
               mail &
          endif

     with the -q option, checkmail is quiet, has no output but
     still sets the status flag.

BUGS
     biff if the user is logged in and they have biff set to y,
     the status returned will be that of old mail.

     from If the user executes the command "from" it will also
     appear as old mail.
