Summary: program to summarize new, unread or all mail in a file
Posted: Fri Sep 26 00:18:55 1986

This is a program I wrote called "checkmail".  It summarizes the mail in
your spool file for you, by displaying who it's from and subject.  It allows
you to select only new, unread or all mail.  This program has only been
tested on Sun Unix 2.3 (BSD 4.2), and I don't know what else it will run on.
For you C hackers, please excuse the Ada-like syntax, I usually use Ada
instead of C.  Bugs and comments to "ucbvax!sdcsvax!telesoft!garym".
