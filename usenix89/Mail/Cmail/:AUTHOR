This is the program I use to do the header cracking for smail.  Smail as
written relies on sendmail for this.  I do not run sendmail, nor would I
want to.  This program gives me the small part of sendmail that I do want.
Note that I have not read the RFC's involved.  My knowledge of headers was
gleaned from such semi-reliable places as the Usenet documentation.

Anyway, the README describes how to set it up on your system.  Hope someone
finds this useful.  I would be interested in hearing about any
hacks/changes/improvements.
