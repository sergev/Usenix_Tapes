This little program reads a mail message from the standard input and parses
the headers as follows:

	To, Cc - parsed into command line arguments for smail, and copied
		 to the output
	Bcc - parsed into command line arguments, not copied to the output
	From - copied to standard output
	Message-ID, Date, Sender - deleted from the message

Anything else that looks like a header is copied to the output without being
processed in any way.  Cmail recognizes the end of the headers when it sees
a completely blank line.  It also assumes that anything that doesn't look
like a header (i.e., that doesn't match the RE '^[^ \t]*:' ends the headers,
but it prints a warning in this case.  Before copying the first non-header
line, it outputs Message-ID, and Date headers.  If a From header was found
in the input it outputs a Sender header, otherwise it outputs a From header.

To install this program on your system:

1) Edit the SMAIL, FULLHOSTNAME, and HOSTDOMAIN defines near the beginning
   of the program appropriately for your system.

2) Compile with "cc -O -o cmail cmail.c".

3) Copy it to an executable directory (e.g. /usr/local/bin or /usr/bin).

The program was written for use with a hacked up Gosling mailer.  This
mailer is not available as it is an embarrasment to mankind, and includes
copyrighted code from the emacs distribution.  It can also be used from vi
(I am told) using the !! command.

Good Luck and Have Fun!
