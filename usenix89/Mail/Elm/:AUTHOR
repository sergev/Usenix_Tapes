In the recent posting of the Elm Mail System two files turned out to 
be corrupted.  Rich and I are working on solving the problem for the
archives, but in the meantime here are uncorrupt versions of both
"Configure.sh" and "src/reply.c".  Please *replace* your current
versions of these two files with those enclosed herein.

		If anyone has further troubles, please let me know.
