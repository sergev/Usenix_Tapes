I've discovered a couple more things about 'elm'.  The minor one is that
the the code ignores the 'pointnew' option unless your sorting method
is by date received.  If you have 'pointnew' set, but it doesn't work,
check your sort selection in ~/.elmrc.

The second problem is potentially more serious.  Rather than creating a
unique pid-based temporary file for the mailbox, elm just uses
/tmp/mbox.<user>.  That's great as long as you don't use job control,
shl, multiple logins under the same name, shell escapes from 'elm', or
any of a number of other methods of arranging to have two copies of
'elm' running at once.  So be careful!  Run one copy of elm only, or
fix the bug.
