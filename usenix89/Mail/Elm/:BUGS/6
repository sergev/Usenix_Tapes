The posting of the recent set of patches to the Elm Mail System 
(version 1.5 as included in the mod.sources archives) to the newsgroup
``comp.mail.elm'' marks the end of my active participation in the 
development, enhancement, and further maintenance of the Software.

As of May 1st I have changed the comp.mail.elm/elm-info submission address 
so that all submissions are immediately distributed, rather than stopping
in my mailbox for perusal.

I've very much enjoyed working with the Usenet community on this project
and hope that in the future I can again offer for use some of the other
software systems I have, or will, write.

Also, I will still be reading the newsgroup on a sporadic basis, so I will
occasionally be able to offer some suggestions and/or advice, but I won't 
be able to actually investigate and fix any reported bugs.  Instead, I 
appeal to you, the reader of this newsgroup, to help with the problems 
other Elm sites have with the system -- it'd turn out wonderfully if the 
software took on a life of its own, so to speak.

As to *why* I'm withdrawing, well, suffice to say that while it isn't a
permanent state of affairs, I have choosen to stop working on the system
as the lesser of a number of possible evils.

	It's been a lot of fun...
