Now that The Elm Mail System is starting to worm its way out from
the posting in mod.sources I'm starting a mailing list for the explicit
purpose of allowing people to get bug reports/fixes, enhancements,
porting information, and so on quickly.

To be added to the list, please send electronic mail to me at:

   hplabs!taylor	  --or--	taylor@hplabs.HP.COM

Also note that this group will *not* be at all moderated...and that
hopefully archives will be available on an occasional basis too.

ps: I already have in the queue for this group messages containing:

	Xenix porting information
	a bug report and fix for "src/newmbox.c"
	a bug report and fix for "utils/from.c"
	problems with Configure.sh on old versions of BSD
	problems with Configure.sh (and other stuff) on a Pyramid
	Documentation quirks
	Problems under Ultrix

    and so on.  (it's not that there are lots of bugs, but that it is
    *very* hard to anticipate the quirks of all these wierd Unix ports
    about.  Right? :-)
