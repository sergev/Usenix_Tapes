IMS is a simple ``folder''-oriented mail reader (think of a baby MH).  It can
be used in interactive mode, or combined with shell scripts to manipulate mail
a' la MH.  (One simple idea is a shell script:

#! /bin/sh
exec ims "$0" "$@"

which is linked to IMS command names and executes the IMS commands.)  The
manual page describes its use.

I have found that it is faster than mailx (Mail) in most things, faster than
/bin/mail in many... and ENORMOUSLY faster than msg (although I haven't tried
its new incarnation as ``elm'' yet).  But it's not full-screen oriented.

This mailer is still tiny and simple at present.  I'll be adding to it, in
particular adding to the folder support, as only the current folder and the
save folder are generally accessible.  But for now it's fast and does the
things I want it to do.

It has been tested under System III and System V; it should work under 4.2BSD
if you #define BSD (it uses BSD-compatible directory routines under USG
unices) but it won't work as is under V7.  It also doesn't store timezones in
messages under 4.2; I haven't the faintest idea how to retrieve the timezone.

Cut at the dotted line, feed to /bin/sh, make, and enjoy!
