Here are a couple of little programs that let you send mail
using a uucp connection, without having to use uucp style 
addresses.  There is a sender (rxmail) that invokes
a catcher (rgmail) on the remote system.  Rgmail, in turn
invokes sendmail to actually deliver the message.

Rgmail has to be installed in one of the directories that uux
can use and an entry for it has to be put into your L.cmds file.
