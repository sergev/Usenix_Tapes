\fIAp\fR is a program that parses addresses according to the ARPA Internet
standard.
It also understands many non\-standard formats.
It is useful for seeing how \fIMH\fR will interpret an address.

The \fIap\fR program treats each argument as one or more addresses,
and prints those addresses out in the official 822\-format.
Hence, it is usually best to enclose each argument in double\-quotes for the
shell.

To override the output format used by \fIap\fR,
the `\-format\ string' or `\-format\ file' switches are used.
This permits individual fields of the address to be extracted with ease.
The string is simply a format stringand thefile is simply a format file.
See \fImh\-format\fR\0(5) for the details.

In addition to the standard escapes,
\fIscan\fR also recognizes the following additional escape:
.nf
.ta \w'escape  'u
\fIescape\fR	\fIsubstitution\fR
error	a diagnostic if the parse failed
.re
.fi

If the `\-normalize' switch is given,
\fIap\fR will try to track down the official hostname of the address.

Here is the default format string used by \fIap\fR:

.ti +.5i
%<{error}%{error}: %{text}%|%(putstr(proper{text}))%>

which says that if an error was detected, print the error, a `:',
and the address in error.
Otherwise, output the 822\-proper format of the address.

The argument to the `\-format' switch must be interpreted as a single token
by the shell that invokes \fIap\fR.
Therefore,
one must usually place the argument to this switch inside double\-quotes.

On hosts where \fIMH\fR was configured with the BERK option,
address parsing is not enabled.
