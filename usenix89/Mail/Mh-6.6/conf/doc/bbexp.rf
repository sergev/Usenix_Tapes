The \fIbbexp\fR program reads the BBoards database and calls \fImsh\fR to
archive the named BBoards (or all BBoards if none are specified).

The first\-metric (which defaults to 12) gives the age in days of the
\*(lqBB\-Posted:\*(rq field for messages which should be expunged.
The second\-metric (which defaults to 20) gives the age in days of the
\*(lqDate:\*(rq field for messages which should be expunged.
Any message which meets either metric will be either archived or removed,
depending on what the \fIBBoards\fR\0(5) file says.
