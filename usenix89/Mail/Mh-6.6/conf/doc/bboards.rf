The home directory of \fIbboards\fR is where the BBoard system is kept.
This documentation describes some of the nuances of the BBoard system.

\fBBBoards, BBoard\-IDs\fR
.br
A BBoard is just a file containing a group of messages relating to the same
topic.
These files live in the ~bboards home directory.
Each message in a BBoard file has in its header the line
\*(lqBBoard-Id: n\*(rq,
where \*(lqn\*(rq is an ascending decimal number.
This id-number is unique for each message in a BBoards file.
It should NOT be confused with the message number of a message,
which can change as messages are removed from the BBoard.

\fBBBoard Handling\fR
.br
To read BBoards, use the \fIbbc\fR and \fImsh\fR programs.
The \fImsh\fR command is a monolithic program which contains all the
functionality of \fIMH\fR in a single program.
The `\-check' switch to \fIbbc\fR lets you check on the status of BBoards,
and the `\-read' switch tells \fIbbc\fR to invoke \fImsh\fR to read
those BBoards.

\fBCreating a BBoard\fR
.br
Both public, and private BBoards are supported.
Contact the mail address \fIPostMaster\fR if you'd like to have a BBoard
created.
