\fIPackf\fR

Each message in the file is separated by four CTRL\-A's and a
@BEGIN: MMDFMTS
newline (identical to the way messages are stored in your receiving mail drop).
@END: MMDFMTS
@BEGIN: MHMTS
newline (identical to the way messages are stored in your receiving mail drop).
@END: MHMTS
@BEGIN: SENDMTS
newline.
@END: SENDMTS
Messages packed can be unpacked using \fIinc\fR.

If the \fIname\fR given to the `\-file\ name' switch exists,
then the messages specified
will be appended to the end of the file, otherwise the file will be created
and the messages appended.
