\fIRepl\fR aids a user in producing a reply to an existing
message.
\fIRepl\fR uses a reply template to guide its actions when constructing
the message draft of the reply.
In its simplest form (with no arguments), 
it will set up
a message\-form skeleton in reply to the current message in the
current folder, and invoke the whatnow shell.
The default reply template will direct \fIrepl\fR to construct
the composed message as follows:

.nf
.in 1i
To: <Reply\-To> or <From>
cc: <cc>, <To>, and yourself
Subject: Re: <Subject>
In\-reply\-to: Your message of <Date>.
.ti +\w'In\-reply\-to: 'u
<Message\-Id>
.in .5i
.fi

where field names enclosed in angle brackets (<\ >) indicate the
contents of the named field from the message to which the reply
is being made.  The `\-cc\ type' switch takes an argument which specifies
who gets placed on the \*(lqcc:\*(rq list of the reply.
The `\-query' switch modifies the action of `\-cc\ type' switch by
interactively asking you if each address that normally would be placed
in the \*(lqTo:\*(rq and \*(lqcc:\*(rq list should actually be sent a copy.
(This is useful for special\-purpose replies.)
Note that the position of the `\-cc' and `\-nocc' switches,
like all other switches which take a positive and negative form,
is important.

If the file named \*(lqreplcomps\*(rq exists in the user's MH directory,
it will be used instead of the default form.
In either case, the file specified by `\-form\ formfile' will be used
if given.

If the draft already exists,
\fIrepl\fR will ask you as to the disposition of the draft.
A reply of \fBquit\fR will abort \fIrepl\fR, leaving the draft intact;
\fBreplace\fR will replace the existing draft with a blank skeleton;
and \fBlist\fR will display the draft.

See \fIcomp\fR\0(1) for a description of the `\-editor' and `\-noedit'
switches.
Note that while in the editor,
the message being replied to is available through a link named \*(lq@\*(rq
(assuming the default \fIwhatnowproc\fR\0).
In addition, the actual pathname of the message is stored in the envariable
\fB$editalt\fR,
and the pathname of the folder containing the message is stored in the
envariable \fB$mhfolder\fR.

Although \fIrepl\fR uses the `\-form\ formfile' switch to direct it how
to construct the beginning of the draft, the `\-filter\ filterfile'
switch directs \fIrepl\fR as to how the message being replied\-to
should be formatted in the body of the draft.
If `\-filter' is not specified,
then the message being replied\-to is not included in the body of the
draft.
If `\-filter\ filterfile' is specified,
then the message being replied\-to is filtered (re\-formatted) prior to
being output to the body of the draft.
The filter file for \fIrepl\fR should be a standard form file for
\fImhl\fR, as \fIrepl\fR will invoke \fImhl\fR to format the message
being replied\-to.
There is no default message filter (`\-filter' must be followed by a
file name).
A filter file that is commonly used is:

.nf
.in +.5i
:
body:nocomponent,compwidth=9,offset=9
.in -.5i
.fi

which says to output a blank line and then the body of the message
being replied\-to, indented by one tab\-stop.

If the `\-annotate' switch is given,
the message being replied\-to will be annotated with the lines

     Replied:\ date
     Replied:\ addrs

where the address list contains one line for each addressee.
The annotation
will be done only if the message is sent directly from \fIrepl\fR.
If the message is not sent immediately from \fIrepl\fR,
\*(lqcomp\ \-use\*(rq may be used to re\-edit and send the constructed message,
but the annotations won't take place.
The `\-inplace' switch causes annotation to
be done in place in order to preserve links to the annotated message.

With the `\-format' switch one can indicate if Internet\-style
formatting should be used (or not be used with `\-noformat').
If present (the default), then lines beginning with the fields
\*(lqTo:\*(rq, \*(lqcc:\*(rq, and \*(rqBcc:\*(rq
will be standardized and have duplicate addresses removed.
In addition, the `\-width\ columns' switch will guide \fIrepl\fR's formatting
of these fields.

The `\-fcc\ +folder' switch can be used to automatically specify a folder to
receive Fcc:s.
More than one folder, each preceeded by `\-fcc' can be named.

A reply template is simply a format file.
See \fImh\-format\fR\0(5) for the details.

In addition to the standard escapes,
\fIrepl\fR also recognizes the following additional escape:
.nf
.ta \w'escape  'u
\fIescape\fR	\fIsubstitution\fR
fcc	any `\-fcc\ folder' switches
.re
.fi

The `\-draftfolder\ +folder' and `\-draftmessage\ msg' switches invoke the
\fIMH\fR draft folder facility.
This is an advanced (and highly useful) feature.
Consult the \fBAdvanced Features\fR section of the \fIMH\fR manual for more
information.

Upon exiting from the editor,
\fIrepl\fR will invoke the \fIwhatnow\fR program.
See \fIwhatnow\fR\0(1) for a discussion of available options.
The invocation of this program can be inhibited by using the `\-nowhatnowproc'
switch.
(In truth of fact,
it is the \fIwhatnow\fR program which starts the initial edit.
Hence, `\-nowhatnowproc' will prevent any edit from occurring.)

.Bu
If any addresses occur in the reply template,
addresses in the template that do not contain hosts are defaulted incorrectly.
Instead of using the localhost for the default,
\fIrepl\fR uses the sender's host.
Moral of the story: if you're going to include addresses in a reply template,
include the host portion of the address.

If \fIwhatnowproc\fR is \fIwhatnow\fR,
then \fIrepl\fR uses a built\-in \fIwhatnow\fR,
it does not actually run the \fIwhatnow\fR program.
Hence, if you define your own \fIwhatnowproc\fR,
don't call it \fIwhatnow\fR since \fIrepl\fR won't run it.

If your current working directory is not writable,
the link named \*(lq@\*(rq is not available.
