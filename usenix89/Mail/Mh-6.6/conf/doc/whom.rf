\fIWhom\fR is used to expand the headers of a message into a set of addresses
and optionally verify that those addresses are deliverable at that time
(if `\-check' is given).

The `\-draftfolder\ +folder' and `\-draftmessage\ msg' switches invoke the
\fIMH\fR draft folder facility.
This is an advanced (and highly useful) feature.
Consult the \fBAdvanced Features\fR section of the \fIMH\fR manual for more
information.

By using the `\-alias\ aliasfile' switch, the user can direct \fIsend\fR
to consult the named files for alias definitions
(more than one file, each  preceeded by `\-alias', can be named).
See \fImh\-alias\fR\0(5) for more information.

With the `\-check' option, \fIwhom\fR makes no guarantees that the addresses
listed as being ok are really deliverable, rather, an address being listed
as ok means that at the time that \fIwhom\fR was run the address was
thought to be deliverable by the transport service.  For local addresses, this
is absolute; for network addresses, it means that the host is known; for uucp
addresses, it (often) means that the \fIUUCP\fR network is available for use.
