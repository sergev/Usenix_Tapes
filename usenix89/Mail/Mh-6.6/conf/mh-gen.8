This documentation describes how to configure, generate, and install
the UCI version of the Rand \fIMH\fR system.
Although the \fIMH\fR system was originally developed by the Rand Corporation,
and is now in the public domain,
the Rand Corporation assumes no responsibility for \fIMH\fR
or this particular modification of \fIMH\fR.
.PP
In addition,
the Regents of the University of California issue the following
\fBdisclaimer\fR in regard to the UCI version of \fIMH\fR:
.in +.5i
\*(lqAlthough each program has been tested by its contributor,
no warranty, express or implied,
is made by the contributor or the University of California,
as to the accuracy and functioning of the program
and related program material,
nor shall the fact of distribution constitute any such warranty,
and no responsibility is assumed by the contributor
or the University of California in connection herewith.\*(rq
.in -.5i
.PP
This version of \fIMH\fR is in the public domain,
and as such,
there are no real restrictions on its use.
The \fIMH\fR source code and documentation have no licensing restrictions
whatsoever.
As a courtesy,
the authors ask only that you provide appropriate credit to the Rand
Corporation and
the University of California for having developed the software.
.PP
\fIMH\fR is a software package that is neither supported by the Rand
Corporation nor the University of California.
However,
since we do use the software ourselves and plan to continue using (and
improving) \fIMH\fR,
bug reports and their associated fixes should be reported back to us so that
we may include them in future releases.
The current computer mailbox for \fIMH\fR is \fBBug\-MH@ICS.UCI.EDU\fR
(in the ARPA Internet),
and \fB...!ucbvax!ucivax!bug\-mh\fR (UUCP).
Presently,
there are two Internet discussion groups, \fBMH\-Users@ICS.UCI.EDU\fR
and \fBMH\-Workers@ICS.UCI.EDU\fR.
If there is sufficient interest,
corresponding Usenet news groups may be established along with the
appropriate gateways.
.SH SYNOPSIS
MAKE
.SH DESCRIPTION
This is a description of how one can bring up an \fIMH\fR system.
It is assumed that you have super-user privileges in order to
(re\-)install \fIMH\fR.
Super-user privileges are not required to configure or generate \fIMH\fR.
.PP
Become the super-user and create a new directory under /usr/src/local/
(or whatever) for the \fIMH\fR area.
Traditionally, the directory's name should be mh/.
The distribution tape contains the hierarchy for the mh.6/ directory.
Bring the sources on-line:
.sp 1
.nf
# mkdir /usr/src/local/mh
% cd /usr/src/local/mh
% tar xv
.fi
.SH CONFIGURATION
First, go to the conf/ directory.
.sp 1
.nf
% cd conf/
.fi
.sp 1
This directory contains files that will produce source files tailored
for your choice of \fIMH\fR configuration.
You should edit only the file \fBMH\fR.
This file contains configuration directives.
These configuration directives are read by the \fImhconfig\fR program to
produce customized files.
For examples of various configurations,
look in the directory \fBconf/examples/\fR.
The file \fBMH\fR provided in \fBconf/\fR is a reasonable default.
.PP
Here are the \fIMH\fR configuraton options available:
.in +.5i
.ti -.5i
bin: /usr/local
.br
The directory where user\-invoked programs go (see manual section 1).

.ti -.5i
debug: off
.br
Support for debug mode of \fIMH\fR.
Don't use this unless you know what you're doing,
which isn't likely if you're reading this document!

.ti -.5i
etc: /usr/local/lib/mh
.br
The directory where pgm\-invoked programs go (see manual section 8).

.ti -.5i
mail: /usr/spool/mail
.br
The directory where the maildrops are stored.
If this pathname is absolute (i.e., begins with a \fB/\fR\0),
then the user's maildrop is a file called \fB$USER\fR in this directory.
If the pathname is not absolute,
then the user's maildrop is in the user's home directory under the given name.

.ti -.5i
mandir: /usr/man
.br
The parent directory of the manual entries.

.ti -.5i
manuals: standard
.br
Where manual entries should be installed,
relative to the directory given with \*(lqmandir\*(rq.
Either \*(lqlocal\*(rq to install manual entries under \fBmanl/\fR,
or \*(lqnew\*(rq to install manual entries under \fBmann/\fR,
or \*(lqold\*(rq to install manual entries under \fBmano/\fR,
or \*(lqstandard\*(rq to install manual entries under \fBman?/\fR,
or \*(lqgen\*(rq to generate but not install them,
or \*(lqnone\*(rq to neither generate nor install them.
For example,
to install manual entries under \fB/usr/man/u_man/man?\fR,
use \*(lqstandard\*(rq and \fB/usr/man/u_man\fR for \*(lqmandir\*(rq.

.ti -.5i
chown: /etc/chown
.br
The location of the \fIchown\fR\0(8) on your system.
If \fIchown\fR is in your search path,
just use the value of \*(lqchown\*(rq.
On SYS5 systems,
this should probably be \*(lq/bin/chown\*(rq.

.ti -.5i
editor: prompter
.br
The default editor for \fIMH\fR.

.ti -.5i
remove: mv \-f
.br
How \fIMH\fR shuld backup existing files when installing a new file.

.ti -.5i
mts: sendmail
.br
Which message transport system to use.
Either \*(lqmmdf\*(rq to use \fIMMDF\fR as the transport system,
\*(lqmmdf2\*(rq to use \fIMMDF\-II\fR as the transport system,
\*(lqsendmail\*(rq to have \fISendMail\fR as the transport system,
or, \*(lqmh\*(rq to have \fIMH\fR as the transport system.
On 4.2BSD UNIX systems 
you can add the suffix \*(lq/smtp\*(rq to the mts setting.
This often yields a superior interface as \fIMH\fR will post mail with the
local \fISMTP\fR server instead of interacting directly with \fIMMDF\fR or
\fISendMail\fR.
The \*(lq/smtp\*(rq suffix is described in detail in the \fIAdministrator's
Guide\fR.
Hence,
for 4.2BSD UNIX systems,
the \*(lq/smtp\*(rq suffix to either \*(lqsendmail\*(rq or \*(lqmmdf2\*(rq is
the preferred MTS configuration.

.ti -.5i
bboards: off
.br
Support for the UCI BBoards facility.
BBoards may be enabled with any mts setting.

.ti -.5i
bbhome: /usr/spool/bboards
.br
The home directory for the BBoards user.

.ti -.5i
mf: off
.br
Support for mail filtering on those systems in which the message transport
system isn't integrated with \fIUUCP\fR 
This option is strictly for an \fIMH\fR system using either \fIMMDF\-I\fR
as its transport system or one using \*(lqstand\-alone delivery\*(rq.

.ti -.5i
pop: off
.br
Support for POP service.
This allows local delivery for non\-local users
(a major win).
See \fBsupport/pop/pop.rfc\fR for more information on the POP.
This option currently works only on 4.2BSD UNIX systems.
(It doesn't hurt to enable this option regardless of whether or not
you intend to use POP.)
If POP is enabled, there are two additional options which are of interest:
\*(lqRPOP\*(rq and \*(lqDPOP\*(rq.
The former indicates that support for the UNIX variant of POP,
RPOP, which uses privileged sockets for authentication be enabled.
This peacefully co\-exists with the standard POP.
The \*(lqDPOP\*(rq option indicates that POP subscribers do not have
entries in the \fIpasswd\fR\0(5) file,
and instead have their own separate database (another major win).
Both of these options can be enabled via an \*(lqoptions\*(rq directive in the
\fIMH\fR configuration file.

.ti -.5i
popbboards: off
.br
Support for the UCI BBoards facility via the POP service.
Requires both bboards and pop to be enabled.

.ti -.5i
options:
.br
\&`\-D' options to \fIcc\fR\0(1).

.in +.5i
.ti -.5i
ALTOS
.br
Use on XENIX/v7 systems.
Also, be sure to use \*(lqoptions V7\*(rq.

.ti -.5i
ATHENA
.br
\fIrepl\fR will assume `\-nocc\ all' as the default instead of `\-cc\ all'.

.ti -.5i
ATZ
.br
Directs \fIMH\fR to use alpha\-timezones whenever possible.

.ti -.5i
BANG
.br
Directs \fIMH\fR to favor `!' over `@'.

.ti -.5i
BERK
.br
Optional for for 4.{2,3}BSD sites running SendMail.
Makes a lot of simplifying assumptions that makes the code run a bit faster.
Also enables one other change:
\fIscan\fR has a -[no]reverse switch which does the obvious thing.
\fIMH\fR purists hate this.

.ti -.5i
BIND
.br
If you are running with the BIND code under 4.{2,3}BSD,
be sure to define this.

.ti -.5i
BSD42
.br
Use on Berkeley UNIX systems on or after 4.2BSD.

.ti -.5i
BSD41A
.br
Use on 4.1a Berkeley UNIX systems.

.ti -.5i
BSD43
.br
Use on 4.3 Berkeley UNIX systems.
Also, be sure to use \*(lqoptions BSD42\*(rq.

.ti -.5i
COMPAT
.br
If you previously ran a version of \fIMH\fR earlier than mh.4 use this option.
After a short grace period,
remove it and re-{configure,generate,install} everything.

.ti -.5i
DPOP
.br
Enables the POP database, useful only if POP service is enabled.

.ti -.5i
DUMB
.br
Directs \fIMH\fR to minimize address munging.

.ti -.5i
FOLDPROT
.br
Defines the octal value for default folder-protection.
For example, FOLDPROT='\*(lq0700\*(rq'.
The default is \*(lq0711\*(rq.

.ti -.5i
ISI
.br
Tells \fIrepl\fR to be more conservative in generating \*(lqcc:\*(rqs to the
user.

.ti -.5i
LINK
.br
Defines the filename for alternate file name for \fIdist\fR and \fIrepl\fR.
For example, LINK='\*(lq\\\\043\*(rq'.
The default is \*(lq@\*(rq.

.ti -.5i
locname
.br
Hard\-wires the local name for the host \fIMH\fR is running on.
For example, locname='\*(lqPICKLE\*(rq'.
It's probably better to either let UNIX tell \fIMH\fR this information,
or to put the information in the host specific \fBmtstailor\fR file.

.ti -.5i
MHE
.br
Enables crude support for Brien Reid's MHE interface.

.ti -.5i
MHRC
.br
Enables \fIMH\fR to recognize the \fICShell\fR's `~'\-construct.
This is useful for sites that run with a ~/.mhrc for their users.

.ti -.5i
MORE
.br
Defines  the location of the \fImore\fR\0(1) program.
For example, on ALTOS and DUAL systems,
MORE='\*(lq/usr/bin/more\*(rq'.
The default is \*(lq/usr/ucb/more\*(rq.

.ti -.5i
MSGPROT
.br
Defines the octal value for default folder-protection
For example, MSGPROT='\*(lq0600\*(rq'.
The default is \*(lq0644\*(rq.

.ti -.5i
NDIR
.br
For non-Berkeley UNIX systems,
this \fIMH\fR will try to find the new directory access mechanism by looking
in \fB<ndir.h>\fR if this option is given.
Otherwise, \fIMH\fR will try \fB<ndir.h>\fR.
If you still can't get this to work on your system,
edit \fBh/local.h\fR as appropriate.

.ti -.5i
NFS
.br
Tells \fIMH\fR to hack around a problem in the NFS C library.

.ti -.5i
NOMHSEQ
.br
Directs \fIMH\fR to make private sequences the default.

.ti -.5i
OVERHEAD
.br
Enable \fIMH\fR commands to read profile/context from open fd:s
without doing an open(); see mh-profile(5) for the details.

.ti -.5i
RPATHS
.br
Directs \fIinc\fR to note UNIX From: lines as Return-Path: info.

.ti -.5i
RPOP
.br
Enables the RPOP variant of POP, useful only if POP service is enabled.

.ti -.5i
SBACKUP
.br
Defines the prefix string for backup file names.
For example, SBACKUP='\*(lq\\\\043\*(rq'.
The default is \*(lq,\*(rq.

.ti -.5i
SYS5
.br
Use on AT&T SYSTEM 5 UNIX system.

.ti -.5i
TTYD
.br
Support for TTYD.

.ti -.5i
UCI
.br
First, \*(lq_\*(rq and \*(lq#\*(rq are recognized as the prefixes for
scratch files.
Second, support for the UCI group\-leadership mechanism is enabled in
\fIconflict\fR.
Third, support for \fB$HOME/.signature\fR files is enabled.

.ti -.5i
UK
.br
Directs the \fIscan\fR program to generate UK-style dates.

.ti -.5i
V7
.br
Use on V7 UNIX systems.
Also, be sure to use \*(lqoptions void=int\*(rq.

.ti -.5i
WHATNOW
.br
Enable certain \fIMH\fR commands to act differently when $mhdraft set.
.in -.5i

.ti -.5i
ccoptions:
.br
Options given directly to \fIcc\fR\0(1).
The most common is \*(lq\-M\*(rq if you're running \fIMH\fR on an ALTOS.

.ti -.5i
curses: \-lcurses\0\-ltermlib
.br
This should be the loader option required to load the \fItermcap\fR\0(3)
and \fIcurses\fR\0(3) libraries on your system.
On SYS5 systems, it probably should be just \*(lq\-lcurses\*(rq.
Some sites have reported that both \*(lq\-lcurses\*(rq and
\*(lq\-ltermlib\*(rq are necessary.

.ti -.5i
ldoptions:
.br
Options given directly to \fIld\fR\0(1) (via \fIcc\fR\0) at the beginning
of the command line.
Useful for machines which require arguments to tell \fIld\fR to increase the
stack space (e.g. the Gould, which uses \*(lq\-m\08\*(rq).
Usually, \*(lq\-ns\*(rq is a good choice in any event.

.ti -.5i
ldoptlibs:
.br
Options given directly to \fIld\fR\0(1) (via \fIcc\fR\0) at the end of the
command line.
The two most common are:
\*(lq\-ldbm\*(rq if you're running MMDF with the \fIdbm\fR package;
and, \*(lq\-lndir\*(rq if you are generating \fIMH\fR on a system
which does not load the new directory access mechanism by default
(e.g., 4.1BSD, SYS5).
If you don't have \fIlibndir\fR on your system,
the sources are in \fBmiscellany/libndir/\fR.

.ti -.5i
oldload: off
.br
Support for the ALTOS loader if \*(lqon\*(rq.
Support for loaders not handling `\-x\0\-r' correctly if \*(lqnone\*(rq.

.ti -.5i
ranlib: on
.br
Support for systems with \fIranlib\fR\0(1).
For SYSTEM 5 systems,
this should be \*(lqoff\*(rq which tells \fIMH\fR to use \fIlorder\fR and
\fItsort\fR instead.
Some SYSTEM 5 sites reported that running this isn't always sufficient.
If this is the case,
then you should edit \fBconf/makefiles/uip\fR to include
\fB\&../sbr/libmh.a\fR and \fB../zotnet/libzot.a\fR twice in the LIBES
variable.

.ti -.5i
tma: off
.br
Support for the TTI \fItrusted mail agent\fR (TMA).
Although the TTI TMA is \fBnot\fR in the public domain,
the \fIMH\fR support for the TTI TMA \fBis\fR in the public domain.
You should enable this option only if you are licensed to run the TMA
software
(otherwise, you don't have the software in your \fIMH\fR source tree).
.in -.5i
.PP
Now edit \fBconf/config/mtstailor\fR,
depending on your choice of the setting
for mts in the \fIMH\fR configuration file.
for an mts setting of \*(lqmh\*(rq,
look at the file \fBconf/tailor/mhmts\fR;
for an mts setting of \*(lqsendmail\*(rq, \*(lqsendmail/smtp\*(rq,
\*(lqmmdf/smtp\*(rq, or \*(lqmmdf2/smtp\*(rq,
look at the file \fBconf/tailor/sendmts\fR;
and,
for an mts setting of \*(lqmmdf\*(rq, or  \*(lqmmdf2\*(rq,
look at the file \fBconf/tailor/mmdf\fR.
.PP
Now install the configured files into the source areas.
.sp 1
.nf
% make
% mhconfig MH
.fi
.PP
You now proceed based on your choice of a transport system
(the setting for mts above).
The best interface is achieved with \*(lqsendmail\*(rq
followed by \*(lqmmdf\*(rq or (\*(lqmmdf2\*(rq),
and then \*(lqmh\*(rq (stand\-alone delivery, not recommended).
.SS SENDMAIL
If you want \fISendMail\fR to transport messages for \fIMH\fR,
then go to the mts/sendmail/ directory.
.sp 1
.nf
% cd ../mts/sendmail/
.fi
.sp 1
This directory contains files whose definitions correspond to the
configuration of your \fISendMail\fR system.
If you have enabled BBoards or POP service,
then you will need to re\-configure \fISendMail\fR.
First, in the \*(lqlocal info\*(rq section of your site's
\fISendMail\fR configuration file,
choose a free macro/class (B is used in this distribution),
and add these lines:
.sp 1
.in +.5i
.nf
# BBoards support
DBbboards
CBbboards
.fi
.in -.5i
.sp 1
Second, immediately after the inclusion of the zerobase file,
in the \*(lqmachine dependent part of ruleset zero\*(rq section,
add these lines:
.sp 1
.in +.5i
.nf
# resolve names for the BBoards system
R$+<@$=B>		$#bboards$@$2$:$1		topic@bboards
.fi
.in -.5i
.sp 1
Be sure to use tabs when separating these fields.
Third, add the line
.sp 1
.in +.5i
.nf
include(bboardsMH.m4)
.fi
.in -.5i
.sp 1
after the line
.sp 1
.in +.5i
.nf
include(localm.m4)
.fi
.in -.5i
.sp 1
in your site's \fISendMail\fR configuration file.
Finally, you should link the file \fBmts/sendmail/bboardsMH.m4\fR into your
\fISendMail\fR cf/ directory and re\-configure \fISendMail\fR.
.PP
If you have enabled POP service,
a similar procedure must be used on the POP service host,
to re\-configure \fISendMail\fR.
First, in the \*(lqlocal info\*(rq section of your site's
\fISendMail\fR configuration file,
choose a free macro/class (P is used in this distribution),
and add these lines:
.sp 1
.in +.5i
.nf
# POP support
DPpop
CPpop
.fi
.in -.5i
.sp 1
Second, immediately after the inclusion of the zerobase file,
in the \*(lqmachine dependent part of ruleset zero\*(rq section,
add these lines:
.sp 1
.in +.5i
.nf
# resolve names for the POP system
R$+<@$=P>		$#pop$@$2$:$1			subscriber@pop
.fi
.in -.5i
.sp 1
Be sure to use tabs when separating these fields.
Third, add the line
.sp 1
.in +.5i
.nf
include(popMH.m4)
.fi
.in -.5i
.sp 1
after the line
.sp 1
.in +.5i
.nf
include(localm.m4)
.fi
.in -.5i
.sp 1
in your site's \fISendMail\fR configuration file.
Finally, you should link the file \fBmts/sendmail/popMH.m4\fR into your
\fISendMail\fR cf/ directory and re\-configure \fISendMail\fR.
.SS MMDF
If you want \fIMMDF\fR to be your transport service,
and have \fBNOT\fR specified \*(lqmmdf/smtp\*(rq (or \*(lqmmdf2/smtp\*(rq)
as your mts setting,
then go to the mmdf/ directory.
(If you're using \*(lqmmdf/smtp\*(rq or \*(lqmmdf2/smtp\*(rq
as your mts setting, then skip to the next section.)
.sp 1
.nf
% cd ../mts/mmdf/
.fi
.sp 1
This directory contains files whose definitions correspond to the
configuration of your \fIMMDF\fR system.
.PP
If you're running \fIMMDF\-I\fR,
then copy the following files from wherever you keep the \fIMMDF\fR sources
to this directory: mmdf/h/ch.h, mmdf/h/conf.h, utildir/conf_util.h,
utildir/ll_log.h, mmdf/h/mmdf.h, utildir/util.h, mmdf/mmdf_lib.a,
and utildir/util_lib.a.
.PP
If you're running \fIMMDF\-II\fR,
then copy the following files from where you keep the \fIMMDF\fR sources
to this directory: h/ch.h, h/conf.h, h/dm.h, h/ll_log.h, h/mmdf.h, h/util.h,
and lib/libmmdf.a
.PP
If you have enabled bboards,
then the directories \fBsupport/bboards/mmdfI\fR
and \fBsupport/bboards/mmdfII\fR
contain information you'll need to
put a UCI BBoards channel in your \fIMMDF\fR configuration.
Similarly, if you have enabled option \*(lqmf\*(rq and are
running \fIMMDF\-I\fR,
then the \fBzotnet/mf/mmdfI/\fR directory contains information you'll need to
put a \fIUUCP\fR channel in your \fIMMDF\-I\fR configuration.
Finally, the directory \fBsupport/pop/mmdfII\fR contains information you'll
need to put a POP channel in your \fIMMDF\-II\fR configuration.
.PP
Note that \fIMMDF\-II\fR is distributed with the BBoards channel,
although the version in the \fIMH\fR distribution might be more current,
the version in the \fIMMDF\-II\fR distribution has been tested with that
revision of \fIMMDF\fR.
.SS MMDF/SMTP
If you are using \*(lqmmdf/smtp\*(rq as your mts setting,
then no futher MTS\-specific action is required on your part!
.SS MMDF2/SMTP
If you are using \*(lqmmdf2/smtp\*(rq as your mts setting,
then no futher MTS\-specific action is required on your part!
.SS "STAND\-ALONE DELIVERY"
If, instead, you want \fIMH\fR to handle its own mail delivery,
then no futher MTS\-specific action is required on your part!
.SH GENERATION
Go to the mh.6/ directory and generate the system.
.sp 1
.nf
% cd ../; make
.fi
.PP
This will cause a complete generation of the \fIMH\fR system.
If all goes well, proceed with installation.
If not, complain, as there \*(lqshould be no problems\*(rq at this step.
.SH INSTALLATION
If the directories you chose for the user\-programs and
support\-programs
(\*(lqbin\*(rq and \*(lqetc\*(rq in the \fBconf/MH\fR file)
don't exist,
you should create them at this point.
.PP
Before proceeding,
you should familiarize yourself with the \fIAdministrator's Guide\fR.
To generate an \fInroff\fR version, go to the doc/ directory
and type:
.sp 1
.nf
% (cd doc/; make ADMIN.doc)
.fi
.sp 1
To generate a \fItroff\fR version, type
.sp 1
.nf
% (cd doc/; make guide)
.fi
.sp 1
instead.
.PP
If you're already running \fIMH\fR at your site,
you should also read the \fImh.6\fR changes document.
The sources are in \fBpapers/mh6.5/\fR.
.PP
Next, if you enabled support for the UCI BBoards facility,
then create a login
called \*(lqbboards\*(rq with the following characteristics:
home directory is \fB/usr/spool/bboards/\fR with mode 755
(actually, use the value for \*(lqbbhome\*(rq given in the \fIMH\fR
configuration file),
login shell is \fB/bin/csh\fR (or \fB/bin/sh\fR),
and, encrypted password field is \*(lq*\*(rq.
The \*(lqbboards\*(rq login should own the \fB/usr/spool/bboards/\fR
directory.
In addition to creating \fB/usr/spool/bboards/\fR,
also create \fB/usr/spool/bboards/etc/\fR
and \fB/usr/spool/bboards/archive/\fR.
These directories should also be owned by the \*(lqbboards\*(rq login.
.PP
If you enabled support for POP,
then on the POP service host,
create a login called \*(lqpop\*(rq with the following characteristics:
home directory is \fB/usr/spool/pop/\fR with mode 755,
login shell is \fB/bin/csh\fR,
and, encrypted password field is \*(lq*\*(rq.
If you don't have \fB/bin/csh\fR on your system (V7),
then \fB/bin/sh\fR is just fine.
The \*(lqpop\*(rq login should own the \fB/usr/spool/pop/\fR directory.
You'll also need to add a line to the \fB/etc/services\fR file and the
\fB/etc/rc.local\fR file,
see the \fIAdministrator's Guide\fR  for more details.
.PP
If this is not the first time you have installed \fIMH\fR,
you may wish to preserve the following files:

.nf
.in +.5i
.ta \w'VeryVeryBigDirectoryName  'u
\fIdirectory\fR	\fIfiles\fR
etc/	MailAliases, mtstailor
/usr/spool/bboards/	BBoards, \&.cshrc, \&.mh\(ruprofile
/usr/spool/bboards/etc/	*
.re
.in -.5i
.fi
.PP
As the super-user, and from the mh.6/ directory, install the system.
.sp 1
.nf
# make inst\-all
.fi
.sp 1
This will cause the \fIMH\fR 
processes and files to be transferred to the appropriate areas
with the appropriate attributes.
.SH TAILORING
See the \fIAdministrator's Guide\fR for information on tailoring \fIMH\fR for
the MTS, BBoards, and POP.
.SH DOCUMENTATION
In addition to this document,
the administrator's guide,
and the user's manual,
there are several documents referenced by the user's manual which may be
useful.
The sources for all of these can be found under the \fBpapers/\fR directory.

make(1)
.SH BUGS
The \fImhconfig\fR program should be smarter.
