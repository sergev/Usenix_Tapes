\fINext\fR performs a \fIshow\fR on the next message in the specified
(or current) folder.
Like \fIshow\fR, it passes any switches on to the
program \fIshowproc\fR, which is called to list the message.
This command
is almost exactly equivalent to \*(lqshow next\*(rq.
Consult the manual entry for \fIshow\fR\0(1) for all the details.

If a folder is specified, it will become the current folder.
The message that is shown (i.e., the next message in sequence)
will become the current message.
.Bu
\fInext\fR is really a link to the \fIshow\fR program.
As a result,
if you make a link to \fInext\fR and that link is not called \fInext\fR,
your link will act like \fIshow\fR instead.
To circumvent this,
add a profile\-entry for the link to your \fIMH\fR profile and add the
argument \fInext\fR to the entry.
