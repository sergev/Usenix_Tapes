This evening a friend asked me how to save his outgoing responses to
netnews in mh folders. I realized that was easy to use mh as the mail
interface to rn. Below is how. You will need to customize a bit.

Look at login for stuff to put in your .login file

Look at bin/rnmail for a shell script for your bin/ directory

Have fun.

There's an easier way to do it which also allows using draft folders
in MH.  Look at rninit for stuff to put in your .rninit file.

Look at bin/mh for a shell script for your bin/ directory.
This file is fine for running a subshell for MH as well.
