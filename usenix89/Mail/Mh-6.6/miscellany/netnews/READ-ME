I noticed that in the mh.6 tar file on huey, you have some things on using
MH for netnews.  I thought you would like the whole kit, so here it is:

===========================================================================
		     Using MH on Netnews and System MSGS

First look at all the directories in /usr/spool/news.  Then, assuming
that your MH directory is ~/Mail, do something like the following:

	% ln -s /usr/spool/news/{net,fa,mod} ~/Mail

You may now reference read-only folders named (for example +net/jokes
and +mod/unix.   
	
Linking /usr/msgs will allow you to read msgs in a similar manner, 
but that you should have your system administrator make /usr/msgs
perms 775 and the msgs program setgid the group on the msgs dir.
Usually the perms are 777, which means this wouldn't be a read-only
folder.

				   WARNINGS

If your version of MH has a limit on message numbers (as in max 2000
msgs) then you will not be able to read folders with highest message
numbers higher than this without modifying the MH source code.

Refiling causes copies to be made of messages, rather than actually moving
them, since these are read-only folders.


		       Doing followups to news articles

In order to do followups to news articles, you should get your
local mail administrator to do the following things on your
system.  It all assumes that you have used /usr/local/lib/mh 
as your MH lib directory.   


First create an alias like this:

	followup:	 "|/usr/local/lib/mh/followup"

This file should look like this and be executable:

	#!/bin/sh
	sed -f /usr/local/lib/mh/followup.sed | /usr/lib/news/inews -h

The sed script should look like this:

	1,/^$/{
	/^From /d
	/^To:/d
	/^Received:/d
	/^Message-Id:/d
	/^Date:/d
	}


Then create a link to repl called flup, and add the following line
to your mh_profile:

	flup:	-nocc all -form flupcomps

where flupcomps is the following  file (located in ~/Mail)

	To: followup
	Subject: Re: %<{subject}%subject%|Orphaned response%>
	%<{followup-to}Newsgroups: %followup-to%|%<{newsgroups}Newgroups: %newsgroups%>%>
	%<{message-id}References: %message-id%<{references} %references%>%>
	%<{distribution}Distribution: %distribution%>
	Followup-to:
	Fcc: +posted
