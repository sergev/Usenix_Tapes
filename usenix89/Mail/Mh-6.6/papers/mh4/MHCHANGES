	Decide that mh.3 is finished.  This file keeps track of the
	changes made between the mh.3 and mh.4 versions.  Note that it's
	being kept in add-source-change format instead of the usual
	add-change-log-entry format.

	uip/bbr.c - Have bbr use a different prompt based on the name it
	was invoked with.  This is useful, since it used to use the same
	prompt as "ex".  This got confusing since sometimes you'd be
	editing a file in ex while composing a message from bbr.


Fri Feb 17 09:10:55 1984  Rand MH System (agent: John Romine) <mh@uci-750b>

	uip/bbc.c: output last update date with -topics in short form
	instead of local leaders.  local leaders are listed with the other
	fields with -topics -verbose.


Sat Mar 31 08:26:29 1984  PostMaster (agent: John Romine) <mmdf@uci-750b>

	uip/mhmail.c: unlink temp file when exiting due to null input.


Mon Apr  2 07:34:35 1984  PostMaster (agent: John Romine)

	uip/refile.c: remove(): bug fix.  call delete-prog if (filep > 0)
	instead of if (filep > 1).


Fri Apr  6 10:52:26 1984  PostMaster (agent:  <mmdf@uci-750b>

	uip/show.c: mhl wasn't seeing its name so it wasn't checking its
	profile entry.  (fix from spencer thomas at utah-gr).


Sat Jun 30 12:28:21 1984  Rand MH mail system (agent: Marshall Rose) <mh@uci-750a>

	sbr/m_getdefs.c: make sure $MH is non-empty before using it.


Sat Jun 30 12:28:48 1984  Rand MH mail system (agent: Marshall Rose) <mh@uci-750a>

	config/mh.h: compact msgs structure a bit.  Also add new entry,
	mp -> attrstats, which tells if the corresponding attribute named
	in mp -> msgattrs is public or private.


Sat Jun 30 12:29:53 1984  Rand MH mail system (agent: Marshall Rose) <mh@uci-750a>

	config/mh.h: Raise MAXFOLDER to 2K-1 and modify DMAXFOLDER as

	Add the SMTP option to the SendMail configuration.  Extend
	post/send to accept -mail, -soml, -saml, and -send.  Also add

	to use $EDITOR prior to using the profile entry for editor.


Sat Jun 30 23:27:27 1984  Rand MH mail system (agent: Marshall Rose) <mh@uci-750a>

	uip/send: if $SIGNATURE is empty, and there's a "signature" entry
	in the profile, set $SIGNATURE to that for post.


Mon Jul  2 02:07:37 1984  Rand MH mail system (agent: Marshall Rose) <mh@uci-750a>

	uip/post, uip/send: rework BCC handling to allow the use of a
	filter file.


Sat Jul  7 01:03:02 1984  Rand MH mail system (agent: Marshall Rose) <mh@uci-750a>

	sbr/m_edit.c: #undef the $EDITOR stuff, maybe it's not such a good
	idea...

	sbr/m_gmsg.c: fix initializatino of flags[].
	uip/whom.c: close down fd:s, just like send does, to avoid the
	    infamous "too many open" files error with the MMDFMTS version
	    of post.
	uip/pick.c: fix-up "[Folder xyz being re-used]" message.  It was
	    using the wrong string for the folder name.

	uip/bbr.c: add the hidden "-prompt string" switch for JLR.


Mon Jul  9 00:01:01 1984  Rand MH mail system (agent: Marshall Rose) <mh@uci-750a>

	uip/prompter.c: with BSD42, do a clearerr() on stdin when we get
	an EOF.  Otherwise, with an EOF in the headers, we lose big...


Mon Jul  9 14:48:51 1984  Rand MH mail system (agent: Marshall Rose) <mh@uci-750a>

	config/mh.h: add extern char *version.
	sbr/help.c: have help() print out program name and version info.
	conf/makefiles/uip: use version.sh to create version.c for loading
	    with uip:s.


Mon Jul  9 17:05:09 1984  Rand MH mail system (agent: Marshall Rose) <mh@uci-750a>

	sbr/showfile.c: take arg vector from caller.

	uip/clrsbr.c: consolidate clear_screen() into one file.

	config/mh.h, conf/config/config.c, sbr/m_{getdefs,update}.c: add
	"context" file in addition to the MH-profile.  The former is
	dynamic, it contains pfolder and private sequences.  The latter is
	static, it contains switches, etc.  The ctx file defaults to
	Mail/context.  But in the MH-profile, you can define the entry for
	"context" to be whatever you want...


Wed Jul 11 02:25:25 1984  Rand MH mail system (agent: Marshall Rose) <mh@uci-750a>

	uip/repl.c: toss the hidden -[no]ccme switches.

	uip/folder.c: remove -up, -down, and -short
	uip/pick.c: toss all the file-op:s, -scan, and -show.  Just define
	    sequences, or spit 'em to stdout.
		The select sub-folder is dead!
		Long live user-defined sequences!
	    Pick got rid of 11 (!!) switches this way, and we've taken our
	    first step into a new age of functionality.

Fri Jul 13 13:17:48 1984  Rand MH mail system (agent: Marshall Rose) <mh@uci-750a>

	    arithmentic to calculate the size.

	uip/mhpath.c: -help wasn't any.
	uip/rcv{cron,tty}.c: set-up for an MMDF system.


Mon Jul 16 00:21:52 1984  Rand MH mail system (agent: Marshall Rose) <mh@uci-750a>

	Install the new Previous-Sequence mechanism.  Introduce the SEQMOD
	flag to the msgs structure.  Just about every MH program now calls
	m_setseq () upon parsing the messages and calls m_sync() prior to

Tue Jul 17 19:20:10 1984  Rand MH mail system (agent: Marshall Rose) <mh@uci-750a>

	Install the code necesary for the @folder notation, meaning
	+cwf/folder (TSUBCWF).

	    remove -[no]unique switches

	on.

	sbr/m_draft.c: add the "use" parameter saying whether "new" or
	    "cur" should be the default.


Fri Jul 20 21:27:03 1984  Rand MH Mail Handler (agent: Marshall Rose) <mh@uci-750b>

	    path of draft/source folder.


Sat Jul 21 14:15:43 1984  Rand MH Mail Handler (agent: Marshall Rose) <mh@uci-750b>

	sbr/{m_gmsg,m_seq}.c: allow "compressed" sequence descriptors
	    (e.g., x-y instead of x x+1 ... y-1 y).  Makes things run
	    faster and avoids problems if a sequence is really *big*.


Mon Jul 23 09:08:12 1984  Rand MH Mail Handler (agent: Marshall Rose) <mh@uci-750b>

	uip/{dist,forw,repl}.c: fix busted logic when m_draft() is called
	after we've built the msgs structure for the folder we're working
	on.  Call m_draft() first.  Other solution was to have m_draft()
	do a pwd(), save the result, do its work, and then chdir() back.
	Sigh.


Mon Jul 23 09:11:27 1984  Rand MH Mail Handler (agent: Marshall Rose) <mh@uci-750b>

	uip/{comp,dist,forw,repl,send}.c: add -nodraftfolder switch to
	    turn off draft folder.
	uip/send.c: add -[no]unique switch to enable/disable message
	    renaming on pushes.

	uip/{scan,replsbr}.c: use ismymbox to determine if address is my
	    mailbox.

	conf/Makefile: make CFLAGS=-O, LDFLAGS=-ns
