"path" is a quick utility to find paths from the local site to a remote
one. It uses pathalias to generate its database, which is incorporated into
the program in a highly compressed form.

Two utility programs massage the pathalias database before "path" gets hold
of it.

"pathfix" creates paths to certain domain gateways and leaf nodes in order
to facilitate the creation of the database, and

"walkdb" creates the ".c" files which make up the database. Ignore any
warnings from these two programs... they'll stop and tell you if there's
a serious problem.

"path" generates paths to sites, but it can also shorten those long
paths that "Rnmail" gets when you reply to netnews. The following
context diff illustrates this:
