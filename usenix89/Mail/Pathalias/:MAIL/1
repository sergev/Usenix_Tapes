in an article Re: XLISP, vincent broman says "don't expect pathalias to
find the way for you to a non-uucp site."

why not?  let's try ...

$ showpath spice.cs.cmu.edu!djz
seismo!spice.cs.cmu.edu!djz

there's no magic here -- i use arpatxt to turn hosts.txt into
pathalias input, pathalias to build the route database, and
showpath as a uucp/domain router.

in the instant case, there's no record for spice.cs.cmu.edu in the
database, but there is one for .edu, indicating seismo as the gateway.

some alternatives:

$ showpath cmu-cs-spice!djz
seismo!spice.cs.cmu.edu!djz
$ showpath spice!djz
seismo!spice.cs.cmu.edu!djz

these also use information derived from hosts.txt by arpatxt, but yield
successful database probes on spice and cmu-cs-spice.

i wrote pathalias and arpatxt, larry rogers wrote showpath.  they are
available on request.
