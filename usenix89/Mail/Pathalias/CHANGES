-- somewhat later in 9/86
Alter hash table as described below.

-- pdp11 version, 9/86
Remove link/host tracing
Make program much slower

Note that the hash table is still in memory.  If many more sites
are entered into the map, Table must be converted to an array of short,
and the temp file references must be converted to node/link numbers instead
of byte positions within the temp file.  Getnode(), putnode(), etc. must then
convert these references back to postions = sizeof(node)*nodenumber.

-- mod.sources, 4.3bsd, 1/86
Improved alias treatment.
Routes to domain gateways.

-- mod.sources, 8/85

Homegrown scanner -- it's true what they say about lex.
Makedb.
Domains and gateways.
DEAD back link.

-- net.sources, 1/85

Private hosts.
Discourage hybrid addresses.  
Magic @ <-> % rule.

-- 1983-1984
