This is a hacked version of pathalias that uses a temporary file
to store the link database rather than using virtual memory.  While
this enables a 16-bit machine (like my Rainbow) to crunch the entire
map, it also makes pathalias v-e-r-y s-l-o-w.  This version is based
on pathalias 8.1, posted to mod.sources in January 1986.

I take no credit (or blame!) for this version.  The temp file hack
was done by someone who wishes to remain nameless -- he doesn't have
the time to respond to bug reports or such.

I have forwarded this version to Peter Honeyman and he is now working
on reconciling the two versions.  I've posted this to net.sources,
rather than mod.sources, in the hope that Peter will soon have a better
version more worthy of membership in the mod.sources archives.  The remainder
of this file is the original README written by Peter.
