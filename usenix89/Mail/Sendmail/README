This is my little package to work out what is going on inside sendmail.
It consists of a sendmail configuration file and a shell script. The sendmail
configuration file was created with ease (see previous messages in net.mail
about ease - i think it's due in mod.sources). The ease source is included.

What this is all about:

	I was having difficulty creating a sendmail.cf. So, I wrote a
sendmail.cf whose sole function was to tag an address as it went through the
ruleset. I coupled this with a little shell script, called args, which snarfs
it's arguments (and stdin) and write them to a log file (/tmp/log is what I
have used - you can alter it to taste, bearing in mind that it will probably
have to suid to write to your directory :-()

What do you do:

	Unpack all this junk. You should have test.mc, test.cf, args and
README. Put args in your search path. Create a dummy mail message. It helps
to know how you mailer calls sendmail. I used args to find out. (I briefly
replaced /usr/lib/sendmail with args and sent some mail). Call sendmail with
the dummy mail item as stdin. ie:

	/usr/lib/sendmail -Ctest.cf foobar <<eof
	To: foobar
	Subject: test

	test mail
	eof

then have a look at what is in /tmp/log

Thats all there is folks. I also use args with real configuration files, so
that I can test them without disrupting the mail service through my machine.
If you have any problems with this stuff, mail me and I'll try and help.
