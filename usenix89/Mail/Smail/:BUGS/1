Subject: Security hole in smail 2.3's handling of ~/.forward

The posting of smail 2.3 has a large security hole in mail delivery
with regard to the use of ~/.forward files.  This is a feature which I
initially added (rather badly, to be honest) and which Larry Auton saw
fit to include in 2.3 in a much better way.  However, his checks for
the condition of ~/.forward are inadequate.

The code is this:
			/*
			** check for ~user/.forward file
			** must be a regular, readable file
			*/
                        sprintf(buf, "%s/%s", home, ".forward");
                        if((stat(buf, &st) >= 0)
                        &&((st.st_mode & S_IFMT) == S_IFREG)
                        &&((fp = fopen(buf, "r")) != NULL)) {
                                aliased = 0;
                                while(fgets(buf, sizeof buf, fp)) {
                                        aliased |= recipients(addr, buf);
				}
                                fclose(fp);
                                if(aliased) {
                                        continue;
				}
			}

This is not sufficiently careful.  It has not checked for things like
.forward being writable a non-owner of the file, a transparent
security hole.  I also recommend that checks be done on the home
directory to see that it, too, is writable only by the owner, lest
some cracker "give" you a .forward file, and suddenly you stop getting
mail without knowing why.
