The following patches are a followup to an article I posted to net.mail
about patches to smail that cause auto-routing of unknown addresses to
a ``more intelligent site''.  To use, set FORWARD to the host that you
wish to have mail forwarded to.  To keep from having it hardcoded in
the program, you can set FORWARD to something like `forwarding-relay' and
then put a line like:

	forwarding-relay = seismo

in a pathalias input file.

If anybody is interested I also have a Makefile for building paths files
that works quite nicely, with lots of capabilities for hardcoding paths,
overriding paths derived from the USENET maps with paths derived from
maps generated locally, and such.
