The enclosed files are a crude little hack that extract geographical
data from the UUCP map '#L' lines and draw a map, in plot(3) form,
on the standard output.  Only small modifications are required to
map other parts of the world.

This is very quick and dirty (if it was any good, I'd post it to
mod.sources instead of net.sources).  No allowance is made for the
curvature of the earth, so the larger the area you plot, the worse
it gets in terms of accuracy.  The names and locations of cities that
are plotted as reference points are wired in to the code.  And the
method for scanning the '#L' lines is very crude (it does, however,
work for almost all the bizarre formats I've seen in the map).

Oh -- color() is a VENIX-specific routine that sets the color for
the output display.  You can probably just remove the calls to it
if you don't have one.

Feel free to hack this -- I would appreciate receiving copies of
improved versions.  It makes a nifty little demo when you're trying
to explain the net to someone.
