This is a simple little desktop calculator for the Sun running under
V3.0 of the Sun O/S and using SunView.

It's my first serious look at SunView so I reckon it can certainly
be improved. Comments, suggestions, improvements and bugs to me.

I still think it's amazing how a little 300 line C program can
generate a binary of about 1/2 megabyte :-)

Regards Rich.
