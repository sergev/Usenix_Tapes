This is the new version of calctool for the Sun (version 1.1). It has a
couple of small bugs fixed and now correctly handles constants.

I thought I sent this a week ago, but it was still stuck in the system. I
apologise for the delay.

Many thanks to Richard Collins for pointing these out. I tried to mail you
the new version, but somewhere it bounced.

I did not expect so many requests for this, I'll have to write another trivial
program soon :-)

I have tried to reply to everybody who requested a copy, but if you didn't get
mail, then please treat this news article as a reply.

Regards Rich.
