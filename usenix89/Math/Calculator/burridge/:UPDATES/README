  Calctool is a very simple little desktop calculator for the Sun
workstation running under V3.0 (or later) of the Sun O/S.

  It is based on the Sanyo cx250 pocket calculator, of which I have
a copy and of which I'm always losing. The first version of this
program was hastily put together. It was also my first real look at
Sunview, Suns own graphics package.

  This is the second version. It supercedes the first version and is
much cleaner. There were a couple of minor bug and I now correctly
handle constants. Feel free to do what you want with it but leave in
the initial comments for the source file.

Suggestion for improvement would be still most welcome plus bugs,
comments and flames to me.

Regards Rich.
