  Calctool is a very simple little desktop calculator for the Sun
workstation running under V3.0 (or later) of the Sun O/S.

  It is based on the Sanyo cx250 pocket calculator, of which I have
a copy and of which I'm always losing. This program has been
hastily put together. It is also my first real look at Sunview,
Suns own graphics package.

  Suggestion for improvement would be most welcome plus bugs,
comments and flames to me.

Regards Rich.
