The following shar file is a scientific calculator for the Atari ST family.
I have included source, files necessary for the RCS, and executable accessory.
The files can be compiled as either stand-alone program or as an accessory 
(the default is accessory).  I leave the bells and whistles to whoever wants
to add them; the program is sufficient for my own use.  Note that I provided
a version of ATN since it was not included in libf (anybody know what
happened?)  The ATN (and SINH) is accurate to the precision allowed by
the floating point representation, but are not optimized for speed
(no Chebyshev, etc...)

Enjoy,
