I know this seems like an elementary programming assignment given to all
first year CS students, but I have found it quite useful in day-to-day
work.  This program compiles a simple language to expression trees and
executes them.  The language includes functions, arrays and most of the C
language control structures.

I have stuck this compiler into *many* other programs, it immediately adds
programmability to many utilities.  For example, I have written a
programmable graphics editor using this compiler which lets the user
define functions to draw arbitrarily complicated shapes at the touch of
a key.

Send wisdom, fixes, bug reports to:
