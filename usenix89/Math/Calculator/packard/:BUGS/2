The interpretive calculator (ic) which was posted a few weeks (?) ago
has a minor bug in base conversion command.  For instance, 10#16 produces
an answer of 'k' instead of 'a' (the hex digit 10).  A quick fix for
the problem is to modify the 'printinbase()' function in file 'utils.c';
change the expression

		if (digit >= 10)
			*--c = digit + 'a';

to be:

		if (digit >= 10)
			*--c = digit + 'a' - 10;

Other than this minor annoyance, the program has worked fine.
