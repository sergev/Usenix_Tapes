This contains the sources for 'ic' an interpretive calculator.

The files involved are:

README		- this file
Makefile	- makefile for 'ic'
builtin.c	- builtin functions and glue to math functions
expr.c		- build and execute expression trees
func.c		- build function definition expression trees
gram.y		- yacc grammar
ic.1		- man page
ic.h		- global include file
lex.l		- lexical analysis and file handling
main.c		- main line, argument parsing mostly
symbol.c	- symbol table management
util.c		- general purpose utilities

This program compiles on 4.2BSD and 2.9BSD systems.  I don't use
any terminal driver features nor any 4.2 special open(2) features
so it should compile on practically anything.  It also contains no
identifiers not unique in 7 chars.  It does not assume
sizeof (long) == sizeof (int) nor does it use void.

Have fun!
