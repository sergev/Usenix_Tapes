Seeing the posted  f.p. checker, I reached into my  grabbag and produced
the following.  It's a shell  file (actually  feeding bc) that,  given a
decimal f.p. number and an optional  exponent, produces a hex version of
the binary  representation in one  of several  formats. As you  can see,
it's very easy to change the format to suit your needs - just change the
value of the variables  'b' and 'f', which specify the  width in bits of
the mantissa and exponent fields, respectively.

Have Fun.
