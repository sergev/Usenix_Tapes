Ever need to know what is the value of the exponetial field of the floating
point variable?  Or the matissa?   This is a handy function to extract them
for you.

It works for 680x0 and 80x86 machines (Sun OS 3.2 and  Xenix).
The byte ordering is decided at run time.  There is no need to make
different versions for different machines.  (I know this doesn't make
sense since you have to recompile for each machine anyway.  But I just like
runtime switching, OK.)

For Vax users, compile with -DVAX instead of -DIEEE.  See header comments.

It works for 4 bytes float only.  If you need to check for 8 bytes floating
point value, do it yourself.

I am interested in how this function works on different systems.  Please
mail me the results of your testing.

It is only one small file.  I see no point doing shar.
