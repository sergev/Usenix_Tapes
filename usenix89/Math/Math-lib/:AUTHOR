This is a portable math library written entirely in C.  Since it has been
several years since I had any interest in doing any more work on it, and
people may find it useful, I have decided to post it.  There should be
a lead-in posting (part 0 of 6?) containing a README file and commands
to make the directories for the regular parts 1-6.  Be sure to read the
README file in 'part 0'.
