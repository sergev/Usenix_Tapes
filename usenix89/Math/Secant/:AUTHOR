The routine given below is a single file containing a package for
finding a real root of a function, using the secant algorithm.
Only one function may be evaluated at a time, since the secant
algorithm is an iteration with memory (i.e. previous values are
used.)  This is not a shar file.  There is a cut line at the 
beginning and at the end.
