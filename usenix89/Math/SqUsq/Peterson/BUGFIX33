Re:   squport mod's for c/70 operation
This is a list of the modifications I made to squport to make it work on the
c/70.  Some of them (e.g. the debug statements and blank lines) are not
necessary, but it works for me.

Re:   PD:<UNIX.CPM>SQU-PORT2.SHAR under ULTRIX
SQ and USQ (squeeze and unsqueeze) will not execute correctly when compiled
on DEC ULTRIX.  They cannot open files because the fopen calls have "rb"
or "wb" as parameters.  The "b" is the culprit and should be removed.
(See lines 164 and 168 of sq.c and 140 and 210 of usq.c).
Maybe some guru can expound on whether the "b" or ULTRIX goofed.

Re:   pd:<cpm.squ-port>
 I have isolated a problem in the portable usq for unix bsd machines.
The problem is the filename of "octbest.lqt" was evidently set up by
wordstar and the last "t" was negative ascii. Unix will not handle
negative ascii so usq failed trying to create the file "OCTBEST.LST".
