/* This program compresses a file without losing information.
 * The "usq" program is required to unsqueeze the file
 * before it can be used.
 *
 * Typical compression rates are between 30 and 50 percent for text files.
 *
 * Squeezing a really big file takes a few minutes.
 *
 * Useage:
 *	sq [file1] [file2] ... [filen]
 *
 * where file1 through filen are the names of the files to be squeezed.
 * The file type (under CP/M or MS-DOS) is changed to ".SQ"; under UN*X,
 * ".SQ" is appended to the file name. The original file name is stored
 * in the squeezed file.
 *
 * If no file name is given on the command line you will be
 * prompted for commands (one at a time). An empty command
 * terminates the program.
 *
 * The transformations compress strings of identical bytes and
 * then encode each resulting byte value and EOF as bit strings
 * having lengths in inverse proportion to their frequency of
 * occurrance in the intermediate input stream. The latter uses
 * the Huffman algorithm. Decoding information is included in
 * the squeezed file, so squeezing short files or files with
 * uniformly distributed byte values will actually increase size.

/* CHANGE HISTORY:
 * 1.3	Close files properly in case of error exit.
 * 1.4	Break up long introductory lines.
 * 1.4	Send introduction only to console.
 * 1.4	Send errors only to console.
 * 1.5  Fix BUG that caused a rare few squeezed files
 *	to be incorrect and fail the USQ crc check.
 *	The problem was that some 17 bit codes were
 *	generated but are not supported by other code.
 *	THIS IS A MAJOR CHANGE affecting TR2.C and SQ.H and
 *	requires recompilation of all files which are part
 *	of SQ. Two basic changes were made: tree depth is now
 *	used as a tie breaker when weights are equal. This
 *	makes the tree shallower. Although that may always be
 *	sufficient, an error trap was added to cause rescaling
 *	of the counts if any code > 16 bits long is generated.
 * 1.5	Add debugging displays option '-'.
 * 1.6  Fixed to work correctly under MP/M II.  Also shortened
 *      signon message.
 * 2.0	New version for use with CI-C86 compiler (CP/M-86 and MS-DOS)
 * 2.1  Converted for use in MLINK
 * 2.2  Converted for use with optimizing CI-C86 compiler (MS-DOS)
 * 3.0  Generalized for UN*X use, changed output file naming convention
 * 3.3  Modified to work with ULTRIX, as per Tom Reid.
