Sorry about this, but private mail to the advertised address bounced from
not being able to open an SMTP connection to uxc.CSO.UIUC.EDU based on:

pwcs.StPaul.GOV
	type = MX, class = IN, ttl = 172780, dlen = 20
	preference = 20, name = uxc.CSO.UIUC.EDU

and an attempt to resend to rutgers.ARPA resulted in a "user unknown" 
advisory...
