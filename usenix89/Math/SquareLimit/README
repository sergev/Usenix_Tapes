SQUARE LIMIT PICTURE

The 3 following files are all you need to generate the M.C.Escher "Square Limit"
picture (apart from a Miranda interpreter!).

To actually create a picture file, compile the code using

    mira fish.m

and type

    pri (fish k) &> ofile

where k is in the range 0-2 and ofile is an output file. The output format is
line specifications, 1 line per physical file line.

I would appreciate it if the general graphics routines were not incorporated
in any published work, as I will need to include them in my thesis! The specific
"Square Limit" functions were originally developed by Peter Henderson and have 
already been published by him.

Have fun!
