SQUARE LIMIT
This drawing, created by M. C. Escher, is a highly recursive picture of
intertwined fish. This drawing was first analysed and re-created by Peter 
Henderson.
Following this header are two picture files containing the first two levels
of the drawing. The third level is too big to transmit at present.

SOURCE CODE
If anybody wants the source code, they are welcome to it. I have two versions
each written in a purely functional language (KRC/Miranda). The source code is 
small (about 10Kb).

PICTURE FORMAT
The original format for each drawing is simply a list of line specifications,
one per line in the form: x1 y1 x2 y2. To reduce the size of this file, these 
absolute coordinates are converted into relative coordinates. Then the file
is compressed using compress (V4.0). Finally the file is uuencoded. So to 
view the picture: uudecode the picture file, uncompress it, pipe it through
the relative to absolute coordinate filter and display on your favourite
device.
