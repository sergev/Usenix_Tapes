There is a program called DOTSYS that is being used by the Institute of
Bioengineering here at Brunel.  It takes a source file of text and produces
an output file of "compiled" braille.  The output can be tailored to match
the requirements of most (any?) braille output devices.  The program reads
a file that contains lists of words/phrases/syllables together with braille
equivalents.  The file also contains rules to determine when a group of
letters may be translated.  This is for Grade 2 Braille.  It can also handle
character-by-character conversion (Grade 1 (Computer) Braille).

Dotsys is being used to produce Braille bank statements for a number of well
known UK High Street banks (no advertising :-)).  I believe they also produce
braille notes/documents/reports.

Dotsys is also being used by the Scottish Braille Press, the National Library
for the Blind and the Royal National Institute for the Blind.  As regards
provenance of Dotsys, I'm not entirely sure...  I *think* it started life
in the U.S of A as a Cobol (:-) :-)) program more than 10 years ago.  More than
11 years ago it surfaced at the Research Unit for the Blind at Warwick
University, UK, run by Dr John Gill.  At that time it was written in Fortran IV.
I'm not sure if Dr Gill did the conversion.  About 11 years ago it reached the
R.N.I.B.  Since then, Dr Gill (plus the Research Unit for the Blind, I think)
has moved down to the Institute of Bioengineering at Brunel.  The version of
Dotsys currently in use is a much hacked-about version  provided by R.N.I.B.
It now includes some facilities for formatting the braille output in a way
that I guess is standard (or becoming so).

The machines it is currently running on are:

  GEC something-or-other at R.N.I.B
  Data General Desktop Generation at Scottish Braille Press
   "      "       "         "     at National Library for the Blind
   "      "       "         "     at Bioengineering in Brunel

The Scottish Braille Press uses a Resus (sp?) paper embosser for proof copy and
a PUMA (German-made) zinc plate embosser for final press editions.

The National Library for the Blind use a Braillo (Norwegian) double-sided
paper embosser for proof and final copies.  The Braillo is in effect a
Braille line printer...

The Institute of Bioengineering at Brunel also use a Resus (sp?) for proof
and final copies.  I think they may have a cut-down version of Dotsys to
run on SuperBrains, but I'm not sure of its abilities.

Finally, the source occupies in excess of 100K, I think, and it *may* be 
possible for me to pass it on, but I should warn that it is *not* very well
documented and the source is not at all readable.  It's been hacked by too
many people (or one person, many times...).

For further information, mail to me across the network, or by Pigeon Post
to:

  Dr. John Gill
  Institute of Bioengineering
  Brunel University
  Uxbridge
  Middlesex
  United Kingdom

So far as I know, none of the above mentioned people/institutes have any
network connections at all, so don't even try it :-)

Disclaimer:  The history of DOTSYS as detailed above does not necessarily
bear any relation to reality.  If I have not given credit where it is due
it's not that I'm trying to rip-off anybody, it's because I don't *know*
who should get the credit.
