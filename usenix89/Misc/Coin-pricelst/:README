As a side-effect of other work, I have produced a file of prices
for U.S. coins, based upon three separate coin price lists for 1980.
I do not intend to update this list, and have no access to more
recent or complete data.  I am offering this data on the assumption
that someone may find the data interesting or useful, and that some
data is better than none.  The remainder of this posting is the
README file explaining the contents of the file; the next posting
will be the actual data file itself.

The file "coins80" contains a list of the prices of various U.S.
coins. This file describes the contents of the "coins80" file.  Each
line of the "coins80" file describes one coin.  There are 2397 lines,
each an average of 97 characters long.  Each line is a set of fields.
The fields are separated by semicolons.  The field contents are:

Field   Contents

1	Face Value of Coin
2	Type of Coin
3	Date and Mint Mark
4	Design of Coin
5	Comments (if any)
6	Mintage
7	Price for Almost Good Condition
8	Price for Good Condition
9	Price for Very Good Condition
10	Price for Fine Condition
11	Price for Very Fine Condition
12	Price for Extra Fine Condition
13	Price for Almost Uncirculated Condition
14	Price for Uncirculated Condition
15	Price for Proof Condition

The entire file is sorted, first by Face Value, then by Date and
Mint Mark.

The file is a result of scanning 3 coin books from 1981.  The results
were then reformatted and checked.  About a month was needed to
correct scanning errors.

Field 1. Face Value of Coin

This field is mainly to aid in sorting the file.  There are ten
possible values for this field: 01, 02, 03, 05, 10, 20, 25, 50, 100,
and 300. The 300 value is used for proof sets.

Field 2. Type of Coin

This field is the name of the type of coin.  The following table gives
the combinations of field 1 and 2 which occur, and the number of each
combination.

Number Field 1  Field 2
----    ---     -----------------
 435	01	Penny
  14	02	Two-Cent Piece
  53	03	Three-Cent Piece
 106	05	Half Dime
 238	05	Nickel
 418	10	Dime
   7	20	Twenty-Cent Piece
 398	25	Quarter Dollar
 420	50	Half Dollar
 236	100	Dollar
  26	100	Trade Dollars
  45	300	Proof Sets

Notice that Proof Sets have a "face value" of 300; both Nickels and
Half Dimes have a value of 05 and both Dollars and Trade Dollars have
a value of 100.

Field 3.  Date and Mint Mark

There are 460 different values for this field.  The dates run from
1793 to 1980.  If a mint mark is present, it is separated from the
date by a space. Mint marks include D (333), S (493), O (177), CC (55)
and P (26).  There are 1312 entries with no mint mark.

Field 4.  Subtype of Coin

Field 6.  Mintage

Mintage is generally given as a large integer, with embedded commas to
indicate thousands, millions, and billions.  These values range from
400 to 5,505,275,000.  Missing or unknown values are indicated by a
field containing a single dash "-".  Some coins are known to have only
a few existing pieces; these are marked as "(Rare)" in the Mintage
field.


Fields 7 to 15.  Price Fields

The price fields contain the prices for each coin for each condition.
Missing data is represented by a "-" field value.  Values range from
0.05 to 520000.00 (1804 Draped Bust Dollar in Proof condition). Values
increase with condition.
