[The original contained a literal escape which I have changed to backslash
notation.  This compiles under System III except for TIOCFLUSH; a rewrite
to System III terminal control would fix this.  I didn't actually test this
because I would have to rewrite it to filter a local package instead... +bsa]

I hope this is the right group for this, but I didn't think it was
big enough to warrant comp.sources.unix (not only that, I had
problems trying to mail to it).
