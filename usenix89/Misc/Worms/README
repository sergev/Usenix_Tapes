This version of Worm will require modification on whatever system you
put it on.  Most multi-user or multi-tasking systems (including
garden-variety Unixes) will not let you turn off interrupts, unless
they have real-time features.

The Tektronix 4404 that this originally ran on had a modified OS for
the purpose.  If you want to run this on a stock 4404, you can simply
comment out the lines labeled "System Dependent" in the Worm routine
-- the Worm will then run an amazing length of time, considering there
are at least 60 interrupts each second.

In any event, the Worm in user space in a virtual memory system is
simply a curiosity.  To be useful, it should work with real addresses.
