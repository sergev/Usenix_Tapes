Here is the final version of the cassette label shell script.  It extracts
the songlists from the 75.enc, 76.enc, etc. database posted by Cliff Matthews
from unmvax.uucp in April of 1985.  It cannot know exactly when the tapes
were flipped, so it puts in the "flip" word halfway down the song list. 
My recommendation is to use this script to produce a file, use a text editor
to make it correspond to your tape, then download it to a Postscript printer.

One calls it like this:

   deadshow 6 17 75 >place

This is a derivative of the cassette label program posted by Scott Anderson
of the University of Minnesota at Duluth a few weeks ago.  Credits for the
idea and the original Postscript program go to him, and to Cliff for the
database.  I just coupled the two together and optimized the result a bit.

The major change from the version I posted last week is the reversal of the
text on the cassette.  The -v option is there to make the new one do what the
old one did.  There are also two new Postscript words "set3" and "set4".

The shell script will never produce the set3 or set4 words, but if you're
editing the output anyway they might be handy for some of those really long
shows (like 12/31/78 or 10/14/80).
