This package (sort of posted some time ago) is something I hacked
together in response to our setting up a network of Suns along with
our old Vaxen.  I wanted to play around a bit with the networking,
so I set myself the task of putting together a pair of client and
server modules which would allow pretty transparent access to a
service which exists somewhere on the network without having to
any sort of network database of locations.  The solution is to
broadcast a request for a service on a given port, and then wait
for a response.  The service requested is named and there is a
simple protocol for communicating between the two processes.
The server is set up so that it can serve any number of clients
simultaneously, all on the same socket, so there is a natural
sequencing of messages as they arrive.  Obviously, this could be
used as the basic interface system for a multi-player game, or some
even simpler service.  I hope someone gets some use out of it.

If anyone has any ideas for improvements, I think that the best
thing to do would be to impliment them yourself, and forward them
to me.  This is my first attempt at this sort of stuff, so please
be gentle.  Also, the source code is liberally documented, and
at this point, that is what I'll rely on as the basic documentation.
