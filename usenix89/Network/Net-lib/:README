Contain below is my network library which I have been
developing over the last few weeks because I got tired
of doing the same thing over and over again...

It does:
	1) Basic networking (IP/TCP)
	2) pty's
	3) IO control
	4) Other misc functions...

This is the FIRST release and so the edges have not
been worked off.  Please,  send any comments or
bug reports to me.

Also,  this uses sockets so that it does not
work on System V.  Sorry...

It also does not make use of XDR.  This means that
 transfering data from machine to machine is still
 ugly.  If only BSD4.3 had XDR....

Have fun with it... lets see some network games!
