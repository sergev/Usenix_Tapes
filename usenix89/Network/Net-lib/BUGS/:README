The following are some small patches that might help make it
work correctly on more machines.  

The fix to the open command was brought to my attention when on
one of the local vax's I had tested this on,  the
DEVICE /dev/tty had been changed to a file!   We
couldn't prove it was any of my program(s) but just to be sure...

Actually, what made it really strange was that the
device was owned by myself.  Seems strange since the
only way to hurt it would to be for myself to be root but I 
am wandering from the subject...

P.S. Before you feed this to patch.. strip my signature. Thanks...
