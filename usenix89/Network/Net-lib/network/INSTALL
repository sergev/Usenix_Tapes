To install:

1) Look at the Makefile to make sure I did not install
   any trojan horses and to configure as you wish.

2) Type "make install" (as root if need be)

   If you just type "make" it will make a version of
   libnet.a in the current directory.  This is the
   configuration the examples/Makefile is setup for.

3) Watch the fun.

4) Look at the examples in the directory "examples".
