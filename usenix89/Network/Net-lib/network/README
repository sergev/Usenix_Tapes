This directory contains the first release of my network
routines.

One of the problems with it is that I really don't have a
real manual for it so users are going to have to use my
examples to figure out how it works. There is a "man" page
for the library but it is not very helpful. Hopefully I
made the examples clear and consise so that they do the
trick for now.  I plan to change this in the future.

If you make any changes,  please mark the changes clearly
so that I don't get blaimed for the mistakes down the
line.  Also, mail me the changes so that I can incorporate
them into the master copy.

Also, I am not responsible for any loss of time or damage
due to this software (I had to say it).
