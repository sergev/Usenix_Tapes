"Fixtcp" is a shell script which is useful for getting rid of 4.2bsd TCP
connections hung in the FIN_WAIT_2 state.

Steps:

	Save this file in some directory.
	Remove first lines from this file so that "#! /bin/sh" should
	be the first line.
	Type "sh file" where file is the name of this file.
	cat fixtcp.mk, and follow those directions.

Enjoy,
