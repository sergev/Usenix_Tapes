When I started checking the /usr/lib/news/active file against the
directories in /usr/spool/news today, I noticed that there were quite
a few discrepancies.  Since it was difficult to determine what was and
was not acceptable, I wrote this quick shell script to find out.  It works
on our 3b2, don't guarantee it for anything else, though most of the
constructs are pretty standard.  Anyway, here it is if you want it.

There are bound to be few bugs, and it is not totally accurate (net and
mod appear because they are not in active).  Comments/suggestions/flames
are welcomed.  It is SLOW, though, if you can speed it up, let me know.
