     Considering the couple complaints I have seen on the net about Checknews
and Vnews not agreeing on the existance of 'news' here is a simple fix for the
problem. Checknews, among other actions, will decide that there is news if a 
newsgroup line in '.newsrc' does not have any digits in it, i.e. is of the
format:
		something.something:

    In this case it assumes that there is unread news and says so, even if no
article was ever received for that specific newsgroup. The fix for this problem
is very simple as shown by the diff below.

	diff checknews.c.ORG checknews.c

218c218
< 	long narts;
---
> 	long narts, nlowest;
226c226
< 		sscanf(aline, "%s %ld", bfr, &narts);
---
> 		sscanf(aline, "%s %ld %ld", bfr, &narts, &nlowest);
256c256,257
< 		if (ptr < rcbuf) {
---
> 		if (ptr < rcbuf)
> 		    if (nlowest <= narts) {
260c261,262
< 		}
---
> 			}
> 		    else continue;


   All we do here is check to see if there are any articles in the 'offending'
newsgroup and only then flagging the existance of un-read news. 

Note: This fix is particular to news 2.10.2 (or any version with a 4 field 
'active' file)
