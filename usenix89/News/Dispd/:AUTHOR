These programs are parts of the automatic notice board "dispd".
If you haven't got 4.2BSD, this isn't for you.

This notice board is displayed on a standard terminal and contains:

0. A header with the last update time.

1. A line per user (who is defined as using this service) with his
   full name and a message (eg "arriving late today", "away sick",
   "in", "out" or anything else you feel like).
   
2. A global message which affects all users. (eg "Coffee at 1600 today")

On pressing "1" on the keybord of the "notice board" terminal the login
status of the users is display (only real ttys, pseudo ttys are ignored).

"^R" on the notice board terminal refreshes the screen.


This system works across machines on the same Ethernet so messages may be
entered from any machine.

"dispd" is the deamon which udates the notice board. This should
use an INET socket < 1000 so should be started by root.

"message [text]" sends a message to the notice board.
"message -u user [text]" may be used to send a message on behalf of
another user.

"whatmess" displays the pressent status of the notice board on any terminal

"gone" text enters the message "gone text" (eg "gone for lunch") on the 
notice board and locks the terminal (ie disables all signals) and prompts
for the users password. On typing the password, the message is removed and
the terminal unlocked (an antisocial command if you have too few terminals!).
