1. Edit the file dispd.h as follows

USERS: this defines the file which shows which users are to be displayed
one user per line (ie login name).

MFILE: the file name of the file for backing up the notice board -
so the messages will survive a machine crash.

TITLE: what you want to appear as the title on the screen

DISTTY: The tty file name of the terminal which will display the notice board
Make sure that there is no getty for this terminal!

GLOB_MESS: The file name of the file containing a global message

HOST: The host name of the machine where the notice board will be attached

DISTYPE: The tty type of the terminal to be used (eg anything sensible
in /etc/termcap)


2. Edit /etc/services as follows:

Add a line similar to the line below on all machines where the message
command can be given.

display		990/udp

990 is a port number which can of course be changed to any other suitable 
number (< 1000) if this conficts with anything you already have.

3. If you wish to run the notice board terminal at a speed other than 9600
b/s edit dispd.c so that the correct speed is inserted in the sgttyb
disptty struct.

4. Compile the system with the command "make all" and install the commands
in suitable places.

5. Add lines similar to the following in /etc/rc.local in the bit where
the local deamons are started. (change /usr/local/lib/dispd to where you
have installed dispd of course).

if [ -f /usr/local/lib/dispd ]; then
	/usr/local/lib/dispd & echo -n ' dispd'	>/dev/console
fi

6. Check that the gecos field of /etc/passwd contains the full name for
each user in USERS file. ie the user's full name should be in the 
5th field (after the 4th ":") and be terminated by a "," eg

blogs:cryp_passwd:101:15:Fred Blogs, other, gecos, info:/u/blogs:/bin/csh


7. Start up "dispd" by typing "dispd" when you are su. (you need to be su
since it binds an INET socket < 1000).

8. See if the system works by sending a message.

I have tested the system on a net comprising SUN's and a VAX.
