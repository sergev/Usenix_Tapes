     Here follows a shar archive for the Junker program, described earlier
on net.news.group.  This is all public-domain.  Testing at ubc-cs has been
as extensive as possible; this is version 1.2.

     If you start using this, please send me a note at
...!{ihnp4!alberta | seismo}!ubc-vision!ubc-cs!andrews
so I can tell how widespread it is becoming.
