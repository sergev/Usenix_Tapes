.TH JUNKER 1 "16 June 1986"
.SH NAME
junker - cut down volume in newsgroups
.SH SYNOPSIS
junker
.I newsdir
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Junker
is a program used to reduce the volume of news arti-
cles in newsgroups in the top-level news directory
.I newsdir.
Sites that can't carry all of certain newsgroups due to
unjustifiable volume can run
.I junker
on those newsgroups,
instead of refusing to carry them.
.I Junker
should be run
automatically with the use of
.I cron
(8).  These runs should
be synchronized with calls to other sites so as to minimize
the volume of news going over those calls.
.PP
.I Junker
reads its standard input to determine what newsgroups
to consider for junking and how it should junk them.  A line
beginning with a hash (#) is treated as a comment line.
Newsgroup data is in lines of the form
.PP
     \fInewsgroup window byteshr\fP
.PP
where
.I newsgroup
is the name of the newsgroup to be affected,
.I window
is an integer giving the length of the "article window" in hours, and
.I byteshr
is an integer giving the desired
newsgroup bandwidth, in bytes per hour.  Every line of this
form defines a "vulnerable directory", constructed from the
runtime
.I newsdir
parameter and the newsgroup name.  (E.g. \fInewsdir\fP/net/politics
for newsgroup net.politics;
.I junker
must
have write access to the directory.) Within that directory,
the line defines a group of "vulnerable articles": those
articles whose "Date-Received" line indicates they have been
received on the system within the "article window", i.e.
within the last
.I window
hours.
.PP
With this information,
.I junker
enforces a limit of \fIwindow * byteshr\fP
bytes on the sum of the sizes of all the vulnerable
articles.  It does this by slicing out the middles of large
articles and replacing them by a block of text of the fol-
lowing form:
.PP
\\ /
.br
 X [\fIsitename\fP: junked \fIn\fP lines]
.br
O O
.PP
where
.I sitename
is the name of the site
.I junker
is running on, and
.I n
is the number of lines sliced out.  Relatively small
articles are left untouched.  For a full description of how
to decide on the parameters for individual newsgroups, see
the document "Installing Junker", which should come with the
distribution of the software.
.PP
.I Junker
takes pains to preserve the integrity of the article
file structure.  It preserves article headers as much as
possible, and if a junked article file had "Xref" links to
it,
.I junker
relinks them to the new version of the file.
.SH EXAMPLE
Say the file junker.in contains the lines
.PP
     # This'll fix em good
.br
     net.legal.wombats 336 500
.br
     net.sport.steamhockey 5 1000
.PP
and
.I junker
has been run with the command
.PP
     junker /usr/spool/news <junker.in
.PP
Then the run will take all the articles in the directory
/usr/spool/news/net/legal/wombats that have come in in the
last two weeks (336 hours) and cut them down to a total of
at most 16800 (336 * 500) bytes.  It will then cut down all
the article files in /usr/spool/news/net/sport/steamhockey
from the last 5 hours to a total of 5000 bytes.

.SH FILES
No file dependencies, except that Junker must have write
access to the specified
.I newsdir.

.SH BUGS
.I Junker
is not quite as fair as it should be to big articles
which have come into the system earlier than smaller arti-
cles.
