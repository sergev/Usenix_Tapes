INFORMATION FOR NETTERS ON JUNKER
---------------------------------

     Junker is a program which was developed in June, 1986,
as a response to a movement among the backbone
administrators away from carrying certain newsgroups felt
to contain high and unnecessary volume.  With junker, sites
can automatically edit large articles which come into their
sites so that the total volume on selected newsgroups falls
below a certain limit.

     You will be able to tell that junker has been run on
some articles coming into your site when you see something
like the following text appearing in articles:

\ /
 X [<sitename>: junked <n> lines]
O O

     This will tell you that junker was run at the
particular site named, that the original article was one of
the largest considered by a run of junker, and that to
limit the volume on that newsgroup it had to cut the
article down by <n> lines.  (The algorithm used to do this
is not that important for the purposes of this discussion,
but if you want to know about it see some of the
documentation that comes with the distribution of junker.)


WHEN A NEWSGROUP GETS JUNKED
----------------------------

     When your favourite newsgroup starts getting junked
articles in it, don't automatically start flaming the
powers that be.  Consider the following things:

1.) Someone has to pay for transmitting to you what you
read.  When sites see their transmission line bills going
through the roof, they have to do something about it.  One
alternative is to cut the newsgroup altogether; another is
to run junker.  If you see the scissors, that means that
you are reading some of the news on that group rather than
no news at all.

2.) The number of lines junked is just information for the
reader.  What's really important is the number of
*characters* cut.  Therefore junker can cut out just two
lines, put in its five-line message, and still save on
volume.

3.) Look at the amount of stuff that got junked on the
newsgroup.  Then look at the amount of stuff in the
newsgroup which, for the most part, serves no purpose in
being there.  If the latter is bigger than the former, you
know what the solution is.  Junker cuts volume arbitrarily;
it can't tell what's junk and what isn't.  The only way for
only junk to be cut is for the newsgroup community to set
some standards for itself, and get rid of the reputation it
has for having tons of crap on it.


VALID COMPLAINTS ABOUT JUNKING
------------------------------

     I can only see people getting seriously angry about
junker if the amount of crap on the newsgroup is less than
the amount sliced out.  In this case, reconsider your anger
carefully.  If it's still with you then post a short,
formal complaint to your newsgroup and net.news.group,
naming the site doing the junking.  If you get a lot of
support from others, maybe the powers that be at that site
will listen (in which case they're decent and you're lucky)
or maybe not (in which case there's no use getting angrier
about it).


HOW TO AVOID GETTING YOUR ARTICLES JUNKED
-----------------------------------------

     Basically, you can avoid getting your article junked
by making sure volume on your newsgroup is kept low.  The
newsgroup net.announce.newusers contains information that
*everyone* should read from time to time to refresh their
memories on how to cut down on volume: don't include a lot
of quoted text, carry on personal battles by mail instead
of news, ask for e-mail replies to questions, reply to
questions by e-mail yourself, etc.

     When you see someone breaking the above rules of
conduct, send a reply to them, preferably with as much
humour as you can muster, reminding them what the rules of
conduct are.  Keep it short.


HOW *NOT* TO AVOID GETTING YOUR ARTICLES JUNKED
-----------------------------------------------

1.) Don't break them up into multiple articles.  The pieces
may get junked again for about as much; if not, you'll have
the effect of junking the articles of other people, who
will (I hope) flame you for it.  If the flaming doesn't
stop you, your site may be obliged to run junker in order
to catch your articles at the source.

2.) Don't try any funny stuff to push them through.  Junker
knows all the tricks and is constantly being revised to
catch new ones.


WHEN A PRECIOUS ARTICLE GETS JUNKED
-----------------------------------

     If Chris Bloggs' article on wombats got several lines
cut out of it, and you *really* want to know what they
were, send a message to Chris asking for a copy of it.  If
you want to follow up Randy Antipasto's article on steam
hockey, but it had some lines cut out of it, don't complain
about it to the net;  either forget about replying or get
the full version from Randy.  

     Similarly, if you find your article has gotten junked,
don't repost it; it'll probably only get junked again. If
someone cares enough about it, they'll mail to you, and
then you can send them a copy.


A FINAL WORD
------------

     Part of the UN*X philosophy is:  "if you want
something done, do it yourself."  I don't like that part
any more than you do.  I didn't want to learn all about the
UN*X file system in order to program junker for the net; I
didn't want to undertake the considerable frustrations of
programming in C with the ragged UN*X documentation at my
site.

     But the point is that anyone who really cares about
the net *can* work on it, and try to make it better.  It
would be better for the users if the backbone people and
the site administrators did all sorts of nice things for
them.  But along with the great and fascinating monster that
is Usenet goes the UN*X philosophy, and we have to accept
that.  The best way for us to improve Usenet is to do good
programming for it ourselves, and maybe that work will be
recognized.
