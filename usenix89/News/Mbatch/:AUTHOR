Here is the script that we have been using successfully for many months
to handle the MULTICAST news batching stuff through UUCP.  The comments
probably explain it all, but note that if your uux does not have a -l
flag to make it create a link to the file being sent, then you won't
want to use this (unless you have uucast or something similiar...)
