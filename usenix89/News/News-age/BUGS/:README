The agef.c program just reciently posted will not compiler on Unix System V.
Here are the changes necessary to do so.  The following code should be
inserted after the includes for the origional source.  

The directory routines included are not intended to be a complete replacement
for the BSD ones, since I do not even have a description of all their functions.
The ones provided work well enough to provide the required functionality to
agef.

Note: The following code assumes that Patch #1 has already been applied.
		Patch #1 basically just changed all calls to roundup() in the source
		to calls to ceiling().
