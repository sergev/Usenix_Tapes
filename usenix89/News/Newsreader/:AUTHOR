For the last couple of years, I've used my own newsreader, which has
also enjoyed favor with some of my co-workers.  It is a completely
different interface than the other readers, its main goal being to
allow rapid scan of a great volume of news.  Many people have made
suggestions which found their way into this program.

Features:

	Once data has been accumulated, the interface is very rapid.
	You see whole screens of titles at a time, choosing the ones
	you want to read / save / print via cursor positioning,
	search strings, marks, or "choose everything".

	Update of .newsrc under user control, not tied to article presentation.

	Unpacks digest articles, lets you manipulate them as normal articles.

Since it IS a different interface, I would advise you to read the manual
page first, and save your old .newsrc the first time you run it, in case
you misunderstand or decide you don't like the way it works regarding updating
the .newsrc.

In a way, this reader reflects my personal biases, not providing some
features I could care less about, providing some things I or others
thought missing.  Favorable responses from a variety of people have
convinced me that my biases are shared.
