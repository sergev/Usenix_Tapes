The '-l' option is standard in 4.3BSD UUCP, which is what Pyramid is shipping
these days. HoneyDanBer also has this capability, under the '-L' option.

Because it's short (well, sortof) and sweet (hey, *I* like it!), here is my
'leafbatch' script and it's related support files. It works with 4.3BSD UUCP
and HDB (change -l to -L). I have run it only with the BSD Bourne shell. It's
intended for 2.10.3; I haven't yet tried it with 2.11, although it should work
without modification.

There is one Pyramid idiom: I used the 'att date' command to generate time
stamps on the temporary batch files. Just about anything else could be used
instead. Look at the $STAMP variable, and modify to taste.

Please be merciful with this code; this is only the second time I've posted
sources, and youse peoples are tougher to please than my boss.... :-)
