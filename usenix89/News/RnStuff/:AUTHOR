I used to find that there were some newsgroups that I just never got round to
reading because they were so far down my .newsrc...  until I saw the light. 
The following csh hack gives you a different .newsrc each day of the week ; you
split your .newsrc into five pieces .newsrc.<Mon,Tue,Wed,Thu,Fri> and then
select the appropriate one for the day.  That way there is some chance that you
can keep up with the smaller number of groups.

The main educational value of kids' toys is to give them
experience of clearing things up when they've finished.
