You might hope that just doing a 'ln' would do, and that rn would then update
.newsrc.xxx when you read news.  Unfortunately the 'ln' alone is not enough; rn
makes its own copy of what it sees as .newsrc and works on that one.  So you
need the '.my.rn' to restore your .newsrc.xxx

Bugs: don't be reading news at midnight. Also, you see things twice if the same
newsgroup appears on two different days.
