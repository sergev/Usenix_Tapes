Oops.  I found a problem with UNaXcess, but I got the fix wrong.  It has
to do with a case in which the "userfile" has an entry which is matched
in getuser() which has too few colons.  I believe that the test at line
51 should read:

	if (ncolon < 6) {

Otherwise, an entry with fewer than 6 colons would be allowed, and one
of the for loops in the code that follows could go into a long search
through memory looking for a colon, clobbering various things as it goes.

I have just started looking at the code, so I might find additional problems
later.  If anyone else out there is working on the code and finds problems,
please post them here, or let me know via mail.  Thanks.
