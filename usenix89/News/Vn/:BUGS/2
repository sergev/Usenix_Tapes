i just installed the new version of vn and have run into a problem,
it seems that a lot of the postings from BITNET have a \0a in the
From: line of the header. This causes gethead to think it has
finished reading the header and return with lin (number of lines in
the atricle) set to zero. My fix was to check for zero and set lin
to some artbitrary number, anyone have a fix to let me finish
decoding the header lines ??
