OK, we had a discussion on this one a few weeks back.  Preventative medicine
like this is a good idea, but you should also go into the gethead() routine
in that same source and replace

	if (index(buf,':') == NULL)

with

	if (buf[0] == '\n')

To be more correct, you should incorporate a special fgets that folds the
continued header lines, such as someone posted, but given the use being
made of the header lines in this context, it probably won't matter - the
examples I've seen don't fold any relevent lines, and the Subject will
be truncated anyway.

I'm curious about something - vn has been happily running with the original
logic from the first issue of the program, and in my private copies for the
last 3 years.  Somebody has just recently started sending out the continued
lines - seemingly all articles from BITNET.  I admit that they're allowed
to do so, and that looking for the colon is a bug, but I'd still like to
know what issue of what posting software is generating the folded lines now.
Only from BITNET?  Only at 2.11 sites?  We're running 2.10.3, and I can't
say that I've ever seen such an article here.
