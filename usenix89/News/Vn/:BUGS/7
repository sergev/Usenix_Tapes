OOPS.  Should have caught that.  Thanks.  Actually, I should have
done a visual pick on that list.  Using the internal newsgroup index
is a trifle crude, also.  It was a relatively quick way to add the
feature while I was doing other enhancements, however.

BTW, the posting of vn to mod.sources recently is pretty much exactly
what came out in net.sources.  It contains the much-discussed "continued
header line from BITNET" bug.  I sent mail with a correction to sources@mirror,
which I should have done before he had a chance to bring it out.  So, if
anyone pulls off that copy, at least go into reader.c and change the
line in gethead():

if (index(bufr,':') == NULL)

to

if (bufr[0] == '\n')

or maybe that was "buf".  I forget.  Of course, the rest of the fix (a
check for 0 where the calling routine divides by "artlin") ought to
be done, too, but this one-liner will prevent the cases that occurred.
