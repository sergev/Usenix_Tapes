We have (at times) needed to store news in different directory paths due to
space limitations. Enclosed is an update to vn to allow searching and retrieving
news from an alternate storage directory path. The changes can be applied
using the patch facility which was posted earlier on the net (NOTE: changes
are in diff -c format)

			Good luck .. Dave Langdon
