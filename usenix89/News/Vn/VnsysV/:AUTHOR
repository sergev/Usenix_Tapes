I've had many requests, so here are the context diffs to make vn work on
system V.  The changes were made to the files tty_set.c and sig_set.c.  In
addition, a change was made to storage.c to handle some NULL pointers that
were being handed to it; this change may be useful on other versions of Unix
as well.  Also included is a makefile for system V.

These changes were made by our resident port-o-matic expert, Peter Kerrigan.
I have directed replies to him, however I make no guarantee that he will be
interested in answering questions...
