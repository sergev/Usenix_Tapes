I hope this doesn't get screwed up and posted twice...

The following shar is a PostScript UPC font and a shell program for
generating UPC labels.  Since I don't yet have a barcode reader, I'm
interested in knowing whether these fellows work.  The bar codes look
correct to the naked eye, but we all know that means nothing to a bar
code reader.  If anyone out there can, let me know if this all works.
If not, please send me your modifications or post to the net.
