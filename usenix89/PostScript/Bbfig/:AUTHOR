Several people have indicated interest in a utility called `bbfig'
that I mentioned in my psfig/tex posting as an tool for calculating
bounding boxes. Here is a shar file containing bbfig; note that this
is done in PostScript and prints the calculated bounding box on 
top of your figure. It cannot calculate your bounding box without
the help of the PostScript printer (sigh). 

Bbfig was originally written by Ned Batchelder.

Enjoy.
