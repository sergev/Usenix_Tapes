In a similar vein, here's a little toy I wrote when I was learning postscript.

It goes through the printer's internal memory and gives an example of
every font the printer has.  For some reason it takes a while to run; probably
because the printer has to scale all of its fonts.

Simply print this on your postscript printer...
