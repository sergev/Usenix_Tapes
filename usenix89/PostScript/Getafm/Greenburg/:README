Dear PostScriptFolk, 

The situation may arise where your PostScript device knows about fonts
that your host computer is not familiar with. The popular TranScript
package from Adobe, for example, contains two important programs,
namely enscript(1) and pscat(1) (the guts of ptroff(1)), that demand
font metrics information in the Adobe Font Metric (AFM) format. (In the
case of pscat, the program pscatmap(8) must be run on the AFM files to
produce troff width files before use.) Adobe, however, only supplies
AFM files for fonts known to the old Apple LaserWriter. Many sites now
use the LaserWriter Plus, which has more fonts which are not supported
with AFM files.  This program gets the AFM files from the LaserWriter
Plus or any other PostScript device, thereby enabling enscript, pscat,
ptroff, or any other programs demanding access to AFM files to print in
any font supported by the PostScript device.
