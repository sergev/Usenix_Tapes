This is a preliminary version of a filter to
convert Epson MX/RX format to PostScript.
Hopefully people who use it will return bug fixes
and enhancements to me or net.sources.bugs.
I will repost this if I get a lot of changes.
I don't have enough applications or time to test it thoroughly.
For example, Super Writer only uses a few of the Epson control codes.

This has more features than the Diablo 630 emulation on the
Laser Writer, so you get nicer output from most word processors.
We use it to print jobs sent from an IBM PC network.
