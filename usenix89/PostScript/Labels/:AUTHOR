Here's my cassette labelling program. It's just something I wrote 
one night. It generates PostScript code, which should work for any
PS machine. 

Also: I am trying to learn the finer points about PostScript, so if
anybody has any PS demo's, send them to me before 5-20-87.
Thank you for your support.
