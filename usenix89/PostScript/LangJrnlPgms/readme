The following programs are from the first issue (1Q87) of the PostScript
Language Journal.  The first is from the Cover Art column; it produces
spiral text like that on the cover of the Journal.  There are several
lines that can be commented out (with %); by commenting these lines you
can produce circular text and normal spiral text.  Note that this program
will take about five minutes to run since rotated characters usually are
not in the font cache and must be calculated separately.

The second file consists of the programs used to produce the starbursts on
the sample pages in the Typesetting column.  Note that because of the size
of the TARGA image (over 100K), we couldn't include it here.  The third file
is the program used to produce the "fountain" or graduated gray bar at the
top of the sample pages.

The fourth file is the font listing program from the Tips and Tricks
column.  The fifth file is the printing program from that column.  The
sixth file is the definition of the "Oneletter" font from the last section
of the Tips and Tricks column.  It has two characters defined: "a" and "b",
each of which is described in the article.

There really isn't anything else in the Journal to post here, since the
program fragments used in the Tutorial aren't long enough to bother with.
