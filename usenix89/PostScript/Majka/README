This package contains a filter for turning raster "image" files into 
PostScript, using the PostScript image operator.  The package contains 
5 files:

README   - this file
Makefile - for make
rps.c    - source
rps.1    - man page in nroff -man form
rps.man  - formatted manual page

The program reads an image, 1 byte per pixel, from its input, converts the 
pixel value into 2 hex digits, and sticks them behind an "image" operator.
An output window of arbitrary size and location may be specified for output.

Our LaserWriters here at UBC seem to be a bit fussy about printing the output.
There seem to be some combinations of input size and requested output size that
make the LaserWriter give up on the job.  If anybody can figure out why,
PLEASE let me know!
