This shar file contains three components needed to generate the
Adobe Font Metric (.afm) files for the internal fonts in the
LaserWriter or LaserWriter+.  These files can then be used to
make Ditroff device descriptions that can be used by
psroff/psdit to access these fonts from Ditroff.

getmetric       PostScript code that prints afm files to
                the LaserWriter's stdout stream. Edit it to
                select which fonts you want afm files for.

afm.awk         Awk script to extract the afm files from the
                TranScript logfiles (does SYSV have these?)

getafms         Shell script that uses sed to get rid of
                carriage returns in stdin and then puts it
                through afm.awk


On our 4.2 system, the logfile used by the print spooler to record
printer errors on our laserwriter is called "/usr/adm/laser-log"
and the following command gets the afm files:

   lpr -Plaser getmetric; tail -f /usr/adm/laser-log | getafms

The second command reads the end of the logfile and keeps
trying upon reaching the end-of-file; this has the effect that
you watch the file as it grows. The output on the LaserWriter
stdout stream gets put into this file, so getafms can extract
the .afm files. Each such file is created with the standard name
in the current directory.

If someone uses it on a SYSV system (or lookalike), could they
post the appropriately modified instrcutions for use.
