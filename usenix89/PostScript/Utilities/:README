Have FUN with your LaserWriter Plus or other PostScript creature!!!

I have written a few programs that play with PostScript in interesting
ways. I have wrapped these up as shell scripts that take arguments to 
determine what is printed. The README file will give the necessary details,
but before reading it, unpack and type these lines from your shell,
just for kicks. You will not sorry.

fontnames 
	-- You will get a page out of your PS creature giving names of each
font that is knows about printed in the font that it denotes. Boring, but
possibly useful.

mapfonts Times-Roman ZapfDingbats
	-- If you don't have these fonts, use the names of ones that you do
have. (LaserWriter Plus has them.) ZapfDingbats has no letters, Roman,
Greek, or otherwise. It was shown as the line of bizarre symbols when you
ran fontnames above. Your PS creature will hand you a page with a few
columns. Octal character codes will be matched to characters in each font.
Still boring, but a bit more useful.

fillchar ZapfChancery-MediumItalic PostScript 5 600 ZapfDingbats '\244' 0.85
	-- Again, change fonts and '\244' to some letter if you do not have
the fonts. I don't feel like explaining it. Do it and then show it to your
friends. Look up octal character 244 on the sheet from mapfonts to get a
clue.

scaleshow '\360' Symbol 600 7
	-- Most things have the Symbol font. Just do it to see what
happens. If you do not have a LaserWriter, you might want to try '\251'
instead.

I also threw in a bunch of useful and useless PostScript routines in a file
called template.ps
