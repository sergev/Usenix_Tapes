The following is a PostScript program that extracts troff font width
tables from the font metric information in a PostScrip printer.
Note that it is designed for use with our own product and not Adobe's
TranScript, although it can be made to output width information for
TranScript with relatively minor changes (mostly in the special
character names).  There are a couple of sample uses commented out
at the end of the program.
