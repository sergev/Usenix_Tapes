This is a new, improved version of my Bourne shell cshell-emulator.
The code has been cleaned up quite a bit, and a couple of new features
added (now supports 'noclobber' and 'iclobber' variables).  A bug with
'eval' that caused "illegal I/O" error messages on vanilla V7 shells has
also been fixed.

I have posted the program in its entirety because a context diff of the
old and new versions was longer than the new version...
