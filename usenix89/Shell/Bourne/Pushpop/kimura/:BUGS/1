	Sorry about the posting for those with bourne shell w/o shell
functions.  I forgot to mention that I was using System V.  Looking over
the man entry on a BSD system, I found that bourne shell doesn't support
shell functions, so I can guess that there are probably other systems
that won't support shell functions in bourne shell.  I guess that there
are quite a few people out there that will find my posting quite
useless..
