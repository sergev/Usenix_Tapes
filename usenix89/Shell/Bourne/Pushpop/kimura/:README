        Here are some shell functions to implement ``pushd'' and ``popd'' for
bourne shell.  They should behave much in the same way as the ``pushd'' and
``popd'' commands in csh.  Having gotten used to using them in csh, I couldn't
live without them, so I decided to write up shell functions that will behave
similarly.

        If you're unfamiliar with ``pushd'' and ``popd,'' here are brief
descriptions:

        pushd -- ``cd'' to a directory (if one is specified) and save the
		 previous PWD into a directory stack.   If no arguments are
		 given, it cd's you to the directory at the top of the
		 directory stack and puts present PWD at the top of the
		 stack  (Essentially switches between the present directory
		 and directory at top of directory stack).

	popd  -- pop the top of directory stack off and ``cd'' to it.
