  This directory contains the software to produce version 1.1 of dpr,
the general purpose screendump utility. This software is now in the
public domain. Permission is given to copy it provided the authors
declaration at the beginning of each code file is kept intact and that
no monies change hands.

  The software has been written to try to make porting to another Unix
machine as simple as possible with minimal rewrite. If anybody does
achieve this, I would be interested in knowing about it.

  I'm also particularly interested in the dumpcap entries for any
printers attached. Also any bugs (especially with their fixes).
