This software is a set of routines for a general purpose screendump utility.
It uses a file called /etc/dumpcap of printer capabilities similar to BSD
/etc/termcap or /etc/printcap.

This version is written for the Sun range of workstations, but has been
designed to be easily modified to other machines.

There is an example dumpcap file containing entries for several printers.

Mail and bugs, problems comments etc.. to me. Also if you port it to any
other system I will be very interested.
