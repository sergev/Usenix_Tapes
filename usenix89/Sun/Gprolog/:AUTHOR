This is GProlog 1.5 for the SUN 2 and SUN 3 (4.2BSD Releases 2.3/3.0).
Gprolog lets you call routines in the SUNCORE library from C-Prolog.

The distribution includes:
	- diffs to be applied to C-Prolog 1.5
	- code that implements the interface between Prolog and SUNCORE
	- a user's manual
	- three puny demos

You'll need:
	- Larry Wall's (great!) patch program (or a lot of patience)
	- the unaltered source to C-Prolog version 1.5
	- a SUN 2 or SUN 3 with a console (i.e., bit mapped display),
	  the SUNCORE library and preferably suntools (does everybody get
	  SUNCORE and suntools?)

To get things rolling:
	1) Make a copy of the original C-Prolog source in a new directory
	2) cd to the new directory
	3) I keep all the C-Prolog boot stuff in a separate directory so:
		mkdir pl; mv *.pl pl
	4) feed the sharfile below to /bin/sh
	5) run 'patch < diffs.1' to apply the diffs to C-Prolog
	6) cd pl
	7) run 'patch < ../diffs.2' to apply the diffs to the .pl files
	8) Edit the makefile; set up the paths for your site
	9) make install
	A) There are three demos, one of which runs outside of suntools.
	   Try the first demo.  Crank up gprolog, then utter the following:
	   	['martini.bw2dd'].
		init.
		demo.
		<... be impressed for a few seconds :-) ...>
		halt.
	   The other two demos, 'martini.pixwindd' and 'c_curve' may be
	   run similarly when you start up gprolog inside of a graphics tool
	   subwindow.

Miscellaneous:
	1) Since we don't have a colour monitor here, gprolog has not been
	   configured for colour.  It should simply be a matter of editing
	   gr1.c (at the very end of the file) and adding a vwsurf struct and
	   an entry to the Surface struct.

	2) You'll want to make a few minor changes to the documentation file
	   (gprolog.nr) to reflect your local setup.

	3) I have a LaTeX version of the documentation but I figure everyone
	   will have [nt]roff.  I also have a version of gprolog corresponding
	   to C-Prolog 1.4.

	4) There may be some stuff in the SUNCORE library for the SUN 3 that
	   I've not added to gprolog.  I pretty much just recompiled
	   the SUN 2 version on the SUN 3.

	5) I haven't the faintest idea where you can get C-Prolog, what the cost
	   is, or what the licensing arrangements are.

	6) gprolog 1.4 has been extensively tested on the SUN 2/50.  gprolog 1.5
	   has been tested, perhaps less extensively, on both the SUN 2/50 and
	   the SUN 3/75.  Several functions for testing gprolog remain (if you
	   do a #list. you'll see them), just in case.

	7) Should you have any bug reports or make any improvements I would
	   appreciate it if you would send them to me instead of posting them
	   to the net.

ENJOY!
