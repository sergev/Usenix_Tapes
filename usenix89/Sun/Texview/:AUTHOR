Here is the source of the TeX previewer for SUN3 computers running suntools.

It has been adapted from the dvisun program of the UNIX TeX distribution
(we got ours in February 86). There are not so many differences between this
version and the original dvisun program. In particular, it does not use the
event manager of SUNview but takes its input in the *PARENT* window.

I hope it also works on SUN2s but I am not sure about it, since we only have
SUN3s with SUNview which is a superset of SUNwindows. However, I think it
should not be too difficult to port it to SUN2s.

Remember you need the pxl118 fonts of the TeX distribution to make it work.

Here is part one of the previewer package.
