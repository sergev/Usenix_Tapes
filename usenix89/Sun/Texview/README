This program is for previewing .DVI files on Sun 3 terminals.

The fonts for this program must be found in ./pxl118

TeXview is a modified version of "dvisun" designed to run under SunView.
(yl@lln-cs) If you only need to make dvisun work on SUN3s, just modify the
dvisun.c source and replace "/dev/bw0" with "/dev/fb".

TeXview and dvisun may go into some trouble (which sometimes lead to a core
dump when you try to manipulate the previewing window) if they need to open too
many font files. This may be avoided by restricting the number of opened files
(MAXOPEN) in the 
dvisun source but in this case, texts which open more font files than permitted
will be unreadable.

Texview needs an icon which has to be put in /usr/include/images/texview.icon.

Texview also includes some changes in order to make it accept the standard vi
keys h,j,k,l instead of l,d,u,r and to use m as "more". However, the old keymap
is still available with uppercase characters. If you don't like it, it is easy
to  modify the source.

INSTALLING TEXVIEW

just type:
	make

and move the texview.icon file to /usr/include/images/texview.icon, and the
texview.n file to /usr/man/mann.


POSSIBLE ENHANCEMENTS

It should be possible to make texview behave like a real suntools tool:
	- making it possible to specify the position, extent, and other
characteristics of the window as -w* flags;
	- taking the texview window as standard input.

If somebody gets enough time to do this, I should be interested in a copy.
