Every once in a while the Sun 2.3 yp server gets hung, and all attempts to
do yp lookups hang indefinitely.  Clients complain "yp: server not
responding for domain DOMAIN; still trying".  So far, the only way I have
found to "reset" the yp server is to "rlogin" to it from some client
(or host) that does not use the afflicted file server for yellow pages
service.  The server resets as soon as the rlogin connection is
established.  Therefore this program takes a numeric internet spec as
an argument (so that no yp lookups need to be done), establishes a tcp
connection to the rlogin port on the server, then closes the connection.
I know this behavior is wierd, but it works.

I use an alias such as:
	alias fixMACHfs 'ypreset A.B.C.D'
so that I don't have to remember the address all of the time.  I know the
following code is trivial, but I thought I'd post it anyway since it is
so short.
