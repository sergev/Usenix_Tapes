This is tgraph, a character graphics package for SVR2 curses.  The main
function provided is also useful for SVR3 curses, which contains most of
the rest of this package's functionality already.

The main user function is "wgraph(win, str)", which outputs graphic chars
as specified by str to the specified window.  This is something of a 
generalized "box" function.  The characters supported are:

		newline:
			print a newline

		'-':
			print a HLINE

		'|':
			print a VLINE

		'+':
			print a PLUS

		'>':
			print a LTEE

		'<':
			print a RTEE

		'T':
			print a TTEE

		'i':
			print a BTEE

		'`':
			print a LLCORNER

		'/':
			print a ULCORNER

		',':
			print a URCORNER

		'.':
			print a LRCORNER

		'_':
			print a horizontal bar on scan line 9

		'=':
			print a horizontal bar on scan line 1

		'^':
			print a UARROW

		'v':
			print a DARROW

		'(':
			print a LARROW

		')':
			print a RARROW

		'$':
			print a DIAMOND

		'#':
			print a CHECKERBOARD

		'o':
			print a DEGREE

		'~':
			print a PLMINUS

		'*':
			print a BULLET

		'X':
			print a BOARD

		'I':
			print a LANTERN

		'@':
			print a BLOCK

		default:
			print a space

For SVR2 curses, this package also defines the SVR3 special characters
ACS_*.  See tgraph.h for these.  They may be used anywhere a "character"
may be passed to a curses function, e.g. addch(), box(), etc.

You must have defined the terminfo attributes:

	sgr (parameter 9),
	sgr0 (turn off parameter 9),
	smacs (start special character set),
	rmacs (end special character set)

Under SVR3 curses, you must also set up the following:

	enacs (send terminal setup string for special character use),
	acsc (character map for special characters; see your manual)

Under SVR2 curses, the special character set is specified by an ASCII file
in terminfo source format; by default, this file is /usr/lib/tgraph.  It
may be changed via the environment variable TGRAPH.  Here is an example
tgraph database:

vt100 | vt100w | vt100-w | vt102,
	hor=q, vert=x, ll=m, lr=j, ul=l, ur=k, utee=w, dtee=v, ltee=t, rtee=u,

wy50 | wy50w | wy50-w,
	hor=:, vert=6, ll=1, lr=5, ul=2, ur=3, utee=0, dtee==, ltee=4, rtee=9,


If the terminal type isn't known to tgraph, it uses defaults -- these are the
same as those used by SVR3 curses.

The tgraph database is similar to a terminfo source file.  However, the \s
escape sequence and escaped commas are not (yet) supported.  The capability
names used are all strings, and only the first character of each is stored.
They are:

        CAPNAME	      DEFAULT

	"hor"		'-'
	"vert"		'|'
	"cross"		'+'
	"ltee"		'+'
	"rtee"		'+'
	"utee"		'+'
	"dtee"		'+'
	"ll"		'+'
	"ul"		'+'
	"lr"		'+'
	"ur"		'+'
	"scan9"		'_'
	"scan1"		'-'
	"up"		'^'
	"down"		'v'
	"left"		'<'
	"right"		'>'
	"dimnd"		'+'
	"check"		':'
	"deg"		'\''
	"plmin"		'#'
	"bullet"	'o'
	"board"		'#'
	"lamp"		'#'
	"block"		'#'

Oh -- who wants to try to hack this into 4.3BSD curses?  Can you specify an
ALTCHARSET attribute?
