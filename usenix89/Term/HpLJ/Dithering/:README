The following is a modification of Steve Hawley's dithering
program modified to work on an HP LaserJet printer.  It
reads stdin and writes stdout, and doesn't take any arguments.
The input format is that used by Version 2.0 of Friedrich Knauss'
ray tracing program:  a one line header with a width and height,
followed by 8 bit pixel values.
