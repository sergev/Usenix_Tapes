*** hello line eater ***

there were a lot more people on the net with imagens than i had
anticipated, so here is the source to the program that takes lines
of input of the form ((x1,y1),...) and converts it to stuff that your
imagen should handle.

a few notes first :
	1) reads from standard input
	2) writes to standard input
	3) the options are to be immediately (ie. no white space) by their value
	4) one option, -P(1/0) (prerasterization on/off) is useful -if- your imagen
	   has the software version that supports it (if you use it and your
	   imagen doesn't support it you will get a comment line on your header
	   page stating prerasterization on)
	5) the other options are documented in the "usage()" function in the 
	   source.
	6) currently the program only takes integral values.

example usage : (for example the fish2 square limit picture)
	igraph -h2 -v3 -r240 -d115 -P1 < fish2 > fish2.imagen
	then you send the "fish2.imagen" file to your imagen (telling it
	that the file is in the imagen's impress language.)

you compile the progam with
	cc igraph.c -O -o igraph

if you make any changes/improvements/etc to the program, i would be
interested in seeing them.

the program was written using tabs every 4 columns.  
enjoy, fred
