I keep getting these sources off the net, with their man pages and -mm
documents, all of them chock full of bolding and underscoring.  This is very
pretty, but my poor Okidata changes head-motion direction up to 8 times per
character which is VERY slow and VERY noisy.

I have therefore cobbled together this filter which collects all the
overstriking on a line and does a whole line's worth at a time.  The Okidata
92 optimizes this to one direction-change per overstrike.  I expect that
with the proper calls this will work for the Oki 83 also.  Moreover, see
the comments for ways to adapt it to other printers.

As distributed, the filter goes one further and uses the hardware options
to perform these actions.

The filter is also capable of taking output of 'col -f' (performing half-line
paper motion) and printing it properly (caveat: this must go to the raw line
printer driver).

For best results, 'nroff -T37' piped to 'col -f'.

WARNING: It is late, and I just finished testing.  This may not cover
everything.  All other disclaimers you ever heard, too.

THIS IS IN THE PUBLIC DOMAIN: As a favor, leave my authorship notice on it.
But this baby is on its own now.
