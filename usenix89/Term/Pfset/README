	Ever go to the trouble to set the pf keys on a terminal
to just how you want them only to have them be changed by the next
guy that comes along? Well this program was written to overcome that.
	We have lots of Teletype 4425s and everybody has their own
preference on function keys. I use this to reset the pf keys to my
layout when I log in.

	This was written with 4425s in mind but it should be easily
modifiable for other terminal types.
