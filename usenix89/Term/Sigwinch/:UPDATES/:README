Now, the reason why I say "I'm lost" is because I've posted the fix to this
program that not only do what John suggests (and did), but added a few things,
but no one seems to know that it got posted!  Something wrong with our 
news software?!  At any rate, here is *my* version, which I believe will
be acceptable by all.  I would like to thank those who sent me suggestions
on this.  (Oh, the flag to "wait" is "-t N" where N is in seconds."
