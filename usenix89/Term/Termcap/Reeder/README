The following shellscript is of use in debugging or modifying termcap
entries.  I have used it for several years on Intel's XENIX systems
and on 4.2 BSD systems (acquaintances have used it on other machines,
whose names escape me).

It provides a cross check on one or more terminal types, contained in
up to 10 termcap files.  It produces a report that should be self
explainatory.  There is no man page.  However, there are extensive
comments that serve to introduce its functionality.

One comment, it uses awk and is "s l o w", but it is much faster and
more accurate than I am.
