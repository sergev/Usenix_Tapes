Having just set up my AT&T 3b2, what do I find, but the terminfo
entry for the DMD 5620 display that came with it is brain damaged:
Once you print a line in standout mode, or underlined, you're
stuck with it.  Normal mode is not restored properly.

So as to do my part to save the world, here are two things:

1) A fixed dmd terminfo entry, and 
2) A little shell script I'm going to call "tock" (Its the inverse
   of "tic", the TermInfo Compiler).
   
Sorry, this is not in shar format: You wouldn't trust it anyway
would you?

No warranties expressed or implied about anything at all.

The fixed DMD terminfo definition is called dmd.src.  To install,
copy this file to your 3b2, and strip out the extraneous verbage.
As root on your 3b2, give the commands:
	unset TERMINFO
	tic dmd.src
This compiles and installs the new info in the database, replacing
the old.  The 'unset' insures that the standard library in its
standard place is updated.
