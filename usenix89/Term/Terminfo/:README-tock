Here is the shell script "tock", a program which un-compiles
a compiled terminfo database entry.  Be Warned:  tock has not been
extensively tested; But it worked well enough to let me fix the dmd 
problem!  You shouldn't assume any sort of portability.  This is
only known to work on my AT&T 3b2 with some version of system V un*x.
