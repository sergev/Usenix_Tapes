Here's one to make the computer "remember" the last terminal you
were using.  You can override at the prompt from tset.

In your ".logout"

unset noclobber
set | sed -n -e '/term/s/ //' -e '/term/s/term//p' > $HOME/.oldterm
echo See you tomorrow $user.

In your ".login"

set OLDTERM = `cat $HOME/.oldterm`
loop:
set noglob; eval `tset  -s -Q \?$OLDTERM`
	if ($TERM == "unknown") goto loop
set term = $TERM
