This is an update to the "untic" terminfo database disassembler.  This message
contains two files, one for updating the manual page and one for updating the
source file.  These diff files can be applied to the latest distribution using
the "patch" program.

The main addition is to add support for the TERMINFO environment variable
which two people thought was important enough to fix the program and send
the changes to me.  Thanks to:
	G A Moffett (amdahl!gam)
	hp-pcd!hplabs!csun!aeusemrs	(Sorry -- no proper name was given)
The other changes are mostly to the comment section of the program, giving
credit where due, and standing on my soapbox.

Thanks to these people and others who have sent notes letting me know that
the program is being used.

I sure hope that this doesn't introduce any new bugs.  Make sure that you
keep backups!
