untic -- Decompile a "terminfo" terminal description file for System V.

I wrote the following program, "untic", because I needed to make a terminal
description file which was just slightly different from one of the existing
terminal descriptions.

This program looks up the description directly from the compiled description
file.  Thus it produces a file, which when compiled, generated exactly the
same information as was in the original file.

This "shar" file contains the following files:
	README		This file
	untic.1		A (very simple) manual page
	Makefile	A (very simple) make file
	untic.c		The program

I hope this program is of some use to people.
