.SH DESCRIPTION
.B untic
convert the terminfo file which corresponds to the specified terminal name
into a file that can be processed by

If multiple terminal names are given, a terminal description is generated
for each of the named terminals.
The output is written on standard output.
.PP
It is wise to backup the original terminal description
(from /usr/lib/terminfo)
before compiling the generated file.
.SH EXAMPLES
To uncompile the terminal description for a "vt100", type:
.RS
untic vt100 >vt100
.RE
To compile this generated file, you probably need root permissions and type:
.RS
tic vt100

.SH NOTES
If new capabilities are added to the terminfo database,
the
.B untic
program will need to be modified.
With luck, the new entries will go at the end of the appropriate tables.
.PP
Most of the capabilities are in the tables in the order that the capabilites
are documented.
There are a few exceptions in the string variables.
.PP
This program is placed into the public domain.
That means that you can do anything you want to with it.
