A terminal lock-up program designed for VT200's follows. It's designed to
immitate the VT200 set-up screen whilst waiting for a password to unlock.
It simply asks you for a password, and then verification; if successful,
the screen will "lock" until interrupted with a CONTROL-C; a password to
"unlock" will then be prompted. See source for more information.

This will probably not run on any non-VT100 compatible terminals, (and
maybe even not on your VT100 compatible terminals either :-> ).
