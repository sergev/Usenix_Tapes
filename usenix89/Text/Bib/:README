The following hack makes bib understand some ditroff escapes when
processing sort and citation templates.  Specifically, it will do
good things with overstruck accents; e.g., if your references are

	%A Gorgeous George
	%T Advanced Nuclear Physics
	%D 1987

	%A Kurt G\o'\(..o'del
	%T Gone with the Wind
	%D 1937

and your citation template is A3\ D, you'll get

Geo 1987		G. George, _Advanced Nuclear Physics,_ 1987.

G<o-umlaut>d 1937	K. G<o-umlaut>del, _Gone with the Wind,_ 1937.

in that order.  Without this hack, "G\o" will come before "Geo", and
the citation will be "G\o 1937", which will cross up ditroff.

This hack does not understand strings--how could it?  If you use
something like \*v (for a Czech hacek) in an overstrike, it will
be treated as a v.  And the citation builder is capable of breaking
in the middle of an overstrike; that's a bug, folks.

I may not post all of bibargs.c.  Here are the changes in context:
