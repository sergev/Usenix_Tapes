The following quickie program is my first attempt at getting pictures
from the Atari ST screen (640X400 monochrome resolution) onto my Talaris
laser printer (a.k.a. QMS Lasergrafix). Any laserprinter which understands
QUIC code should work.

The program takes DEGAS (a drawing program on the Atari) output, which is
a 34-byte color map plus a plain bitmap, and wraps it up (without modification
of the bitmap) in the appropriate QUIC commands. Pixels are magnified
4X in each direction to produce a picture the same size as the screen.

It is written in VAX C 2.2 for VMS 4.4, but it is quite portable if the
'rfm=var' is taken out of the fopen() statement. This is a VMS directive
to create a file with the RMS record format VAR so that it prints nicely
under VMS. Note that for VMS, the output file must be printed /PASSALL.
