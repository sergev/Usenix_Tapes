Here is a dvi to Xerox 2700 driver in C.  It runs under Unix on an
assortment of machines (VAX, Gould, Sun under 2.0 & 3.0).  It reads PK
files, as well as PXL files, so might be of interest even to people
with 2700's.  It is based (heavily) on the dvi2ps that comes with Unix
TeX.  It works hard to do the best it can with the 2700's limited
memory, it assembles fonts on the fly, sending only the characters it
needs.  It tries to load down the fonts for the whole document at
once, but if it looks like it's running out of memory it will back
off, print as much as it can, and try again.  It's been running a few
weeks here and, whilst I expect there are still bugs left, it seems to
have stabilised (if Christer Lindh <clindh@uucp.sems> is listening - I
did try to send this to you, but I think there must be a black hole in
the middle of the English Channel).  One gotcha - laser.setup should
have the \E's replaced by real ESC characters.  Have fun ...
