The use of this program may not be readily apparent.  If your
printer's name is "laser", you would use a command sequence that
looked something like this:

	% tex myfile
	% lpr -Plaser -d myfile.dvi

If you are using your own fonts, or want to restrict the range of printing,
you should use something like

	% tex myfile
	% dvix27 -a '.:/usr/lib/tex/fonts' -f 1 -t 5 myfile > myfile.x27
	% lpr -Plaser -l myfile.x27


Installation comments:
======================

The font area is assumed to be /usr/lib/tex/fonts.  I do not believe that
that this filter supports the TEXFONTS environment path.  The font area is
arranged in a new fashion that will probably be showing up in other device
drivers as well.  All the tfm files are contained in /usr/lib/tex/fonts.  If
a file named SUBDIR is present in /usr/lib/tex/fonts (or whatever directory
name you select), then the name of the font is taken as the name of a
subdirectory in searching for the pxl file associated with the font.  In
other words, amr10.1500pxl will be found in
/usr/lib/tex/fonts/amr10/amr10.1500pxl.  When the file named SUBDIR is not
present, all pxl files are looked for in the directory itself, in other
words, /usr/lib/tex/fonts/amr10.1500pxl in the above example.

There are some constants in dvix27 which may need to be changed, TOP
and LEFT define the (0,0) point on the page, measured in 1/300" from
the *bottom* and left edge (TOP = 3500 gives the top edge of the paper
on A4).  The margin setting command is for A4 paper (search for %cm).

Note that the fonts which come ready made with TeX are not much good
on the Xerox (they are too pale and weedy) - you should go back to the
METAFONT input and re-create them.  The 'qms' mode from waits.mf seems
to be a good first approximation.  Make up a METAFONT which includes
the waits base (insert 'input waits ;' before the 'dump' in inimf),
and use lots of lines like

	mf \\mode=qms \; mag=magstep 0.5 \; input cmr10

then use gftopk on the GF files to produce PK files that dvix27 can
read.

I'm afraid there is no man page for this.

printcap information
====================

Warwick use another program called dvix27f when the LaserWriter is
used with the /etc/printcap file.  dvix27f invokes dvix27 and laserf.
laserf is basically the standard lpf, but is *really* transparent when
given the -c flag (well almost ...).  It uses a file which it expects
to find in /usr/local/lib/laser/setup to initialize the printer.
Change the definition of setup in laserf.c if you want to move this.
A sample setup file is in laser.setup, this will need changing for
printers with different built in fonts or different paper sizes.  Both
dvix27f.c and laserf.c are included here.  Warwick's printcap entry
for the 2700 reads:

#
# Laser Printer
#
laser|Laser Printer:\
	:lp=/dev/laser:br#9600:fs#06360:mx#0:ff=\Eo\f:tr=\f:\
	:of=/usr/local/lib/laserf:if=/usr/local/lib/laserf:\
	:df=/usr/lib/tex/dvix27f:\
	:af=/usr/adm/laseracct:\
	:rf=/usr/local/ansicc:sd=/usr/spool/lpd/laser:xs#20:


History and acknowledgements
============================

The driver was converted by Neal Holtz of Carleton University from a
Sun previewer originally written by Mark Senn and later modified by
others (see dvi2ps for specifics).  Additional modifications and
enhancements have been done by Scott Jones and Chris Lindblad at MIT.
Conversion to Xerox 2700 and to read PK files was done by Rob McMahon
at Warwick University (cudcv@uk.ac.warwick.daisy).
