This shar archive contains all that is needed to compile a 1stword to
latex conversion program for the 520ST.  It is probably not as complete
as it should be but I found it was useful : it sure did help with my
thesis....  The file 1stlatex.uue is a uuencoded version of the executable.
Please read the README file.  Have fun...
Oh, yeah, 1stword and Latex are trademarks of somebody.
