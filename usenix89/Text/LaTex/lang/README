--- 1stlatex : a translator from 1stword format to latex format

This is a program that simplified my life :-)
The file ccw.bat contains the whole procedure to compile it.
Please check if the file 1stlatex.inp has the libraries on the
right disks for you.


NOTE: 1stwart.w <<<< is source code that has to be preprocessed using
			WART.  This preprocessor is included in the
			distribution of KERMIT.  If you don't have WART,
			you can still compile 1stlatex, as I have provided
			1stwart.c, the post-processed version of 1stwart.w .
			You will have to remove the line 
				ckwart .....
			from ccw.bat.  Some clever fellow might use LEX,
			I don't know how compatible WART is though.

usage is 
	1stlatex infile outfile

I decided to keep the echo to the screen of the input file. I felt
a lot more reassured to see the file go by (even though it looks rather
wierd...).

I tried to make the result as close to the original file as possible.
There are a few trade-offs though.  If you used multiple attributes
for characters, they may not all be used in the latex output. 
(i.e. light italics underlined characters might not give you what you expect).
Also, if you had neatly aligned tables, well ----- I got news for you.
Equations will look so so, better go and put real latex commands if you
are not satisfied. Hebrew characters are not implemented, and I even used
some of them for my purpose : one got mapped to "\partial", for instance.
Look at 1stquote.c for a hint of what is available.
