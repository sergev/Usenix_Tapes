Here is an index processor for converting LaTeX ".idx" files to "theindex"
environments.  The second part contains a set of libraries it uses.
I have only tested the program on a Pyramid 98x running 4.2 BSD although
it should port to VAXen readily.  If you are not running on a Pyramid,
you'll want to remove the routine "getunent" from the "trw" library
since universes don't make sense.
