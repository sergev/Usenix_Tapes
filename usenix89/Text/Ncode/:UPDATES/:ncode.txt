Here it is: the new, improved ncode.c along with new, improved sample
files which help you appreciate all the wonderful features of the program.
To unwrap your kit, save it in a file called "ncode.shar".

To assemble your kit, delete everything in the file above (and including)
this "cut here" line, and delete everything below (and including) the
other "cut here" line near the bottom of the file.  Then give the command

	sh ncode.shar

and start by reading the README file.  Cheers.
