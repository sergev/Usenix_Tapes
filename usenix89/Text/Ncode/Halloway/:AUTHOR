This is a new version of 'ncode', the driver program for the supermarket
rag headline database. Formatting and capitalization are vastly improved,
and the buffer size has been increased to allow for larger databases. (Mine
is already up to 17K... every time I see a new rag headline, in it goes...)

If anyone is interested in swapping databases, send me mail.
