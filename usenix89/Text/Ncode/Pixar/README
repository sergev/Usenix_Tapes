You should now have README, ncode.c, ncode.1 and ncode.sample.

This source is known to compile and run on 4.2 BSD.  With the possible
exception of the calls to srandom() and random() I suspect the rest is
very portable.  Compile it "cc ncode.c -O -o ncode" and then try

	ncode ncode.sample

For more fun, try

	ncode -n 10 ncode.sample

And for a good education say

	ncode -g "I work for CODE\"

Then you might want to read the man page, ncode.1, to learn about how it
works.  You can make it pretty with "nroff -man ncode.1".  If all of this
leaves you hopelessly confused, send mail to {sun,ucbvax}!pixar!good and
I'll send you more confusing sample files.  If I feel like it.
