We have it running on a number of VAXen, under both 4.2 and UTek (Tektronix's
enhanced 4.2).  We also have it running on a large number of 6130s (Our 32016
Unix box) and 6210s (an internal use 32032 box).  It appears to work as
advertised.  The only drawback would be for high-volume shops: it is much
slower than, for instance, troff and an Imagen, but it's also a third of the
price!
