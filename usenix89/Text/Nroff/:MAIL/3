We have used TranScript to generate LaserWriter input from both the
4.2 BSD troff (for the C/A/T/) and for Tektronics graphics codes.
Both work pretty darn well.  The 300 dpi resolution is impressive
in light of the low cost of the entire system.  Sure beats dot matrix
printer plots and the very expensive (but high speed) 3800 laser
printer from IBM.  When you want publication quality, however, you
need higher resolution at about $30-40k in today's market.
