The following shell file contains the program epx,
a driver for epson printers using nroff on an ATT 7300 (maybe any UNIX).
It should work with all Epson and epson compatible printers in draft mode.
It may work with epson compatible printers in near letter quality mode.

Also included is an nroff driver table for epson printers (tabepson.c), that
should be compiled with Bruce Townsend's table utility (thanks Bruce).
Epx will not work without it.

			Have fun with it, and good luck.
