	Epx generates nroff output for epson compatible printers.
This should work on any compatible printer in draft mode.
Some playing may be needed for NLQ mode.

To make the program type
$ make epx

	Create the nroff driver table tabepson using Bruce Townsend's program
that was posted to the net, and move it to /usr/lib/term/tabepson.

	After epx and tabepson have been installed (tabepson in /usr/lib/term),
test the program by typing (with the printer on)
$ make test

	On close examination of an actual Epson FX-85 manual, it has been
discovered that epson compatible printers are only compatible in draft mode.
The command to put the printer in NLQ mode may be different.  Look at the
subroutines tonlq(), and frnlq(), to make sure they are correct for your
printer.  In tonlq(), the string "\033(" should be replaced with "\033x"
on real epson printers.  Real epson printers do not allow user
defined characters in NLQ mode, so epx will only work in draft mode anyway.

	Some printers allow italics in NLQ mode,
so the statement turning off italics in NLQ mode may also be removed.

	This program may be used with any printer that have the needed
capabilities by changing the routines
tobold(),frbold(),toitalic(),fritalic(),tounder(),frunder(),tospec(),frspec(),
tonlq(),frnlq(),halfline(),backhalf(),backfull(),download()
as required.
