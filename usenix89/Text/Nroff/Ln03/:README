Here is a file for use with the "table" program (posted about a month
ago) to create /usr/lib/term/tabln03 necessary for nroff to generate
ln03 output.

This is for USG systems only, not Berkeley.

Note: the ln03 does not have italics fonts in rom, so if your ln03 
is a cheapie, anything in italics comes out underlined.
