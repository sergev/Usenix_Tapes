While unshar'ing the travel macros recently posted on mod.sources
(Mod.sources:  Volume 4, Issue 75 Submitted by: Jerry Peek 
(Tek CSC Training) <tektronix!tektools!jerryp>)
I received a message about a loss of 8 characters from the original
tmac.ti.  This discrepancy is probably due to news, mail or uucp
software at genrad or decvax (or here) gobbling those 8 characters.
Anyway, I had to make the following modifications to my tmac.ti to make
it work properly:

Changed the .tl invocations to separate the arguments properly.
Added escapes inside macros to use invocation-time
values for distances (when kilometres, etc.).
