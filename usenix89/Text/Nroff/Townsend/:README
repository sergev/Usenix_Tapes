Many of you have asked for what I have, which includes
Bruce Townsend's invaluable nroff table generating stuff and
some of my own HP LaserJet stuff.
Bruce's stuff is available from mod.sources, but is
reproduced here (sorry); my own laserjet table.c for one of
the font cartridges is included also.
I also put in three lp interface models, also for use with
the same font cartridge.
You're pretty much on your own administering the lp system.

	This program is intended for USG systems only, since
Berkelely has a different driver table format, and I understand
that many (all?) Berkeley systems have the necessary tools
supplied.
	My submission includes a program for building tables
from a source, a man page (term.5) explaining the source, a
program that does the inverse operation of building a source
from existing binary tables (useful for modifying existing
tables) and various bits of documentation.
	The program is not guaranteed to be portable to all
USG systems, as I did not have access to any other than my own,
but it does run on at least two other machines, and it should
not be too much work to port to any USG machine.


Following is the shar archive of the source.
