There was recently a source for proportional nroff printing posted to
net.sources, and it requires my nroff table maker (USG systems only,
I believe).  This program "table" compiles nroff driver tables (the
files referred to by the -T option of nroff; e.g. nroff -T450) from
the source description, and the included "elbat" program is the inverse
operation.

Elbat is useful for looking at existing driver tables.  Neither program
is guaranteed to work properly, and there have been scattered complaints
of certain driver tables not working properly on certain systems.  No
bugs have been traced, however.  Conversely, some people have used the
program very successfully (including me).

Although this program was posted to mod.sources some time ago (> 1 year)
and is presumably in the mod.sources archive, I have had a few requests
to repost to net.sources.  I am doing so, particularly because I have
seen no recent activity in mod.sources, and the lead time would be too
great to satisfy those now waiting for the source.

Have fun.  Bug reports are welcome, providing they are concise, relevant,
and contain all pertinent information.  They will be acknowledged, but
no action is promised.  Bug reports with *fixes* are most welcome.  They
will be acknowledged, and I will incorporate the fix and repost or send
diffs if warranted.
