	There are two programs in this package. "table", written by
Bruce Townsend with help from Ian Darwin, prepares an nroff driver
table from a source file. "elbat", written by Matt Crawford and
modified for USG UNIX by Bruce Townsend, is the inverse operation -
it decompiles an nroff driver table, producing a source file.

	The Makefile should not need modification other than to
add new names of terminal drivers, of the form "tabXXX" where
"XXX" is a mnemonic for a terminal, e.g. tab450 for a Diablo 450
in 10-pitch mode. These names are added to the TABFILES definition
in the Makefile. The format for Berkeley tab files is different
and thus this package will not work on Berkely systems without
substantial hacking.

	You may want to change CFLAGS, LDFLAGS, etc. to your taste
or de-bugging preference.

	To compile the elbat program, type "make elbat".
To de-compile a file, type "elbat /usr/lib/term/tabXXX > tabXXX.c"

	To compile a tabXXX file (say tab450), type "make tab450".
Of course, you need the tab450.c source before you do this.
Do NOT FORGET to include the tabXXX name in the TABFILES definition
in the Makefile first.

	Be VERY CAREFULL with "make install" (try "make -n install
first).

	Read the table.doc file and the term.5 man page for more info.
I have updated the term.5 man page to reflect this program.

IF YOU HAVE PROBLEMS...
	It is quite possible that some or all of the integers stored
in the tabfile are long, not int. On our machine, long = int = 32 bits,
so I do not know which is appropriate. Read the table.doc file for
more info.

Acknowledgements:
	Ian Darwin tested out the first (very buggy) version of
this utility, and suggested many useful changes, including the
introduction of the Makefile.

	Matt Crawford wrote the elbat program originally for
Berkeley systems.
