These are lp interface models for running a HP LaserJet with
the Courier P&L font cartridge.  They are for both local use
and remote (uux-based) use.

On the local machine, a banner page is generated, and the
proper escape sequences are generated for the Courier or LP
fonts in portrait or landscape mode (line spacing, page
size, etc.).
For remote operation the "server" interface is just a dumb
byte-dumper, which dumps the "bannerized" and "escapized"
output generated by the "client" interface.

On central machine with printer:
HPLjet for printing files from the machine; administered as
the interface for class Serial, printer HPLjet
HPLjet_server (linked to dumb_S on a 7300) to print remotely
generated output; administered as class Serial, printer
Other

On remote machines:
HPLjet_remote (linked to dumb_remote on 7300); administered
as class Remote, printer HPLjet, device /dev/null.  It uses
uux to get the output over to the server for printing by the
dumb HPLjet_server.
