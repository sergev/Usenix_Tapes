A while ago I queried the net for an nroff driver for the HP laserjet.
Although I got a few replies, I got none I could really use. So, I put
one together myself (it is included below).

The table assumes the use of the J-font cartridge, which has the full greek
and math fonts on it. The only undesireable feature about it is that
square brackets more than two lines high have the verticle bars bolder than
the bent parts of the brackets; this is a problem with the font set itself.

The table is known to work with 4.2bsd nroff; it is compatible with the
-man, -me, and -ms macro packages. The .b directive does not cause bolding,
however; use \fB and \fR to change to bold. I don't believe two-column mode
works; we don't use it enough for me to fix it. Neqn and tbl do work,
though spacing may need to be adjusted by hand.

Although term(5) claims nroff tables have fields *iton and *itoff, our
nroff doesn't. If yours does, the modification to the table should be
simple and obvious.

Please mail bugs or enhancements to me; net.sources doesn't get to most
of the machiones in our local net, and I don't have access to the ones it
gets to.

One more thing - please don't reply to sherm@wucs who sent this for me -
if your mailer ignores the reply-to line, please reply to me personally
(see the signature at the bottom - that came out right).
