There seems to be some trouble with the "NSA" keyword scanner I sent out
a few days ago - it seems to have been replaced by an entirely different
program somewhere along the way, and even that one is flawed -- it doesn't
contain such little known keywords as hpbunjml, psqifvt, cbobob ovu csfbe,
efdpejoh uijt, epou and cpuifs. I acquired this list using the Freedom of
Information Act (FIA), and I think the USENET community should know!

I'm posting the source again, and I've checked it fairly carefully for
NSA type keywords - maybe it will get through this time.
