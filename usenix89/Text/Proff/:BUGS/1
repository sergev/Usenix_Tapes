There seems to be a minor bug in Proff, the recently distributed text
formatter. The command .wr <string> causes a break in text formatting
which is undesirable if the command is to be used to send printer
escape sequences (such as bold, italics, etc). Indeed, there is a 
brk() call in the command interpreter [pxxparse()] code. However,
eliminating the brk() call causes the .wr <string> argument to be written
at the begining of the formatted text. 

If anyone has fixed this bug, please post. Otherwise, proff seems to
run fine (both 4.2 BSD and AMIGA, using Lattice 3.02 - although the
linker will complain).
