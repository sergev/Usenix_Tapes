We found a bug in the bold selection for the Courier P&L
font cartridge, which is fixed by changing:
/*bdon    */		"\033)s3B\016",
to
/*bdon    */		"\033)ss3B\016",
in the tabljet.c file processed by Bruce Townsend's
generator.
The extra "s" is actually the shortest way of adding
"\033)s0S" to the string, which selects upright style.
