These macros are for the proff formatter and emulate the nroff
mm macro package. (George Walker recently posted a similar
set of macros to emulate the nroff ms macros.) The following
mm macros are supported:

	P, SP, SK, SA, H, HU, BL, DL, ML, AL, LI, LE, DF, DS, DE, TC

In most cases there are some limitations. These are described
in more detail as comments within the macros. All numbered
headings are set up to emulate the default mm settings. If
you want to change the standard behavior for a particular
heading level, the macros can be easily tweaked.

In addition to the macros listed above, a few of the simpler
mm registers are supported:

	Pt	default paragraph type (0 or 1)
	Pi	standard paragraph indentation
	Li	list indentation
	Si	standard display indentation
	Ds	# of spaces before and after displays
