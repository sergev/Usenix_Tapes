Todays feature: The Problem of the Green Capsule, John Dickson Carr, 1939
Gideon Fell solves the "Psychologist's Murder Case". Five eye-witnesses, a film
and still no one could identify the murder.

Here is the nroff table for proportional print on the Apple Imagewriter.
Also assorted other utilities to use with it to actually make it all work.

Warning - not tested on Berkely Unix. 

I received about thirty requests after my announcement last week so thought
is was easiest to simply post. (I wouldn't take even odds on being able to
reply to more than half of the people who responded, without a lot of playing
around with my mailer!)

Bug reports welcome  ---  caveat emptor.
