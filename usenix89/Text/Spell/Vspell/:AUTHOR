I posted shell script called 'vspell' some months ago.
It's an interface to 'spell' which makes browsing the
spelling errors and fixing the mistakes a much easier job.

It was a Sys V script, I didn't attempt any compatibility with
4.2 BSD.  I recently received a 4.2 compatible script from
Peter Lamb.  I can vouch that it still runs nicely under Sys V.

I have appended the list of Peter's changes and a shar file
with the original man page and the 'vspell' script with
changes incorporated. At line 30 of the script you can
substitute the +local_file option instead of
fgrep if your 'spell' supports it.

Many thanks to Peter Lamb.
