DVIDOC is a WEB program written a very long time ago at Ohio State University.

It is not an official product.
It is not used very often even here at OSU.
It will not be supported by anyone at OSU, INCLUDING the author.

THIS PROGRAM IS A HACK.

It is based on an ancient Babylonian version of DVITYPE.  I don't even
know if the WEB file will go through modern versions of tangle, weave, &
TeX.  If not, oh well.  Life's tough.

If you do get it working, have a fun time.  If not, it could show you
one approach to solving the problem of generating ASCII files from TeX output.


Enjoy...
