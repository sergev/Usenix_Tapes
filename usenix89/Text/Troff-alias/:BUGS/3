My approach is to use the shell's "here-document" capability, putting the
command line  to format the document as the first line of the document, and
executing the file when I need processed output, for example (to include
tbl, eqn, and pic preprocessors and to print the output on an Imagen
printer):
	tbl <<!EOF | eqn | pic | troff -mm | ipr -ltroff
	...
	!EOF
Then either make the file executable with chmod, or type sh filename to get
the formatted output.
