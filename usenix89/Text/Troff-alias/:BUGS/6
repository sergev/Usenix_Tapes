Neat idea.  I like it.  One problem though -- how do you allow for both
printed output and terminal output.  So, I fiddled for awhile and got
this to work:

     if test "$1" = -p 
     then
     	roff="ptroff -ms"
     else
     	roff="nroff -ms | more"
     fi
     echo $roff
     eval $roff <<!EOF
     ...
     !EOF

Run this through sh and it will nroff to the terminal.  Add the -p
parameter and it will ptroff to the printer.
