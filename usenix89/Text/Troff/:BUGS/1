I have noticed a few MAN(1) pages that use this format 
for comments ( please ignore the leading >'s, I put them in for news' sake):

Unfortunately, this isn't a comment.  It just calls a non-existant
null macro called '..'.  Our troff generates warnings for these
things, which is good for catching bizzarre text formatting bugs.
Anyway,  the real troff comment is:

>.\" This is a comment.


	Thank you for listening.
