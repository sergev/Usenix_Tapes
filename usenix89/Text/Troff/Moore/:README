This is a follow-up to the troff indexing article I posted last month.
A couple people have had some problems with it.  The major problem is
that the Icon programs were written in an older version of the language.
I have updated these programs so that they will compile under the most recent
version.  They are included below.  The other problem is a typo in 
the sort command.  Where I said:
	sort +1n +0n -1n ....
I should have said:
	sort +1 +0n -1n
Now, it won't try to sort the index items numerically, only the
page numbers.
