The BITNET path only works from sites that have AC.UK in their tables.  Sorry.
Extract finds specified definitions of macros (for the text formatters nroff,
troff, ditroff, titroff) and prints them.  For example,
     $ extract -ms I
produces
     .de I
     .nr PQ \\n(.f
     .ft 2
     .if !"\\$1"" \&\\$1\\f\\n(PQ\\$2
     ..
You can say
	extract I
because -ms is the default.  You can also say
	extract -fmymacs PP X XX pp
to find the definitions of PP, X, XX and pp in the file "mymacs".

The program ``soelim'' that is used is not supplied here.  It's standard with
BSD, and a public domain version was posted to the net.

The 4.2BSD -ms macros work out filenames to give to ".so" at runtime, so
it doesn't always work with them.

Nested macro definitions can produce surprising (but correct) results.
Source, Makefile and manual entry enclosed.

1:	Edit the Makefile: you'll need to alter the "R=/usr/local" if you
	don't want mailsplit to live in /usr/local/usr/bin.
	You may also want to rename it "fsplit".  I prefer "fsplit", but it's
	called mailsplit for historical reasons.

2:	make mailsplit

3:	have a play with it & satisfy yourself that it behaves reasonably

4:	make install

Make "install" will do a "$(MAKE) $(CLEAN)" afterwards.  If you don't want to
remove the binary, say
CLEAN="" make install
at step 4.

I shall be leaving Warwick to move to a new job at the end of the week, so
although mail will be forwarded (& I'd be glad of any changes that you needed
to make), I may take a while to respond!

Note that there are TAB characters in "extract.sh".  They're inside []:
the two lines like
	    '/^[.'"'"'][ 	]*d[es][ 	]*'"${pat}"'$/,/^\.\./p
			^      ^
                        |      |
                      tab      space
and similarly for the 2nd place in the same line, on each of the two lines.
Beware of using cheap editors.
