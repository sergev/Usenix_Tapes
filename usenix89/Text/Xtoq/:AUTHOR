Since a flawed version of this seems to be circulating behind my back,
I may as well make it public.  This C program accepts a Tex "PXL" file
and produces a QMS-1200 download file.  Glyph dimensions are hacked.
If the host is little-endian, you must convert the input to little-endian.

To compile, you need a header file that I will post afterwards.
