D.C. Hayes (the modem people) are proposing a new protocol for use on
error-free communication lines such as X.25, X.PC, or MNP modems.
It's called FAST and this file details the preliminary specification.
They are looking for comments from interested persons.  Now is the
time to get your ideas in while the protocol is still in the early
design stages.
