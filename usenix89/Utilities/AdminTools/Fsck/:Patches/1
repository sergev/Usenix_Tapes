This program is a nice idea; it saved me the trouble of writing it (or
harassing my vendor to write it).  I have always wondered why Berkeley
chose do do it the way they did; it would seem to be just as much work
to keep track of the arms and do the checks as this program does as it
is to keep track of the passes and do those in parallel.  Maybe all of
us can lobby to have the algorithm in fsck changed to this one; with a
suitable example before us it can't be that hard.  And preen adds a nice
heuristic to generate the list of arms that fsck could use by default if
no information is given in /etc/fstab to override it.

The only problem with preen is that it doesn't work as it should.  Indeed,
it determines which drives are on separate arms, and the code is there to
keep them busy.  The only problem is that the code that waits for a child
to finish so that another fsck can be run on the same arm has a \small/ bug
in it.  Instead of waiting for the \first/ child to finish, it waits for
\all/ children to finish.....  The net effect is that does groups of passes
the same way that fsck -p does, and is potentially worse than fsck -p in
that it doesn't necessarily group the filesystems in a reasonable order.
(Not to say that an SA would do any better, but the possiblilty is there.)

The fix turns out to be trivial (aren't they all?) and is attached below.
