ofiles.c
  display process ids and other info on processes that have
  files open on given device.
  original author of 4.2 version cspencer@???
  this version has been tested with vnode file systems, sun 3.2,
   unix 4.3bsd/nfs (mt xinu), sequent (dynix 2.1)
  

ofiles will need read privileges to /dev/mem kmem and drum

for sun 3.2, you will need to hack /usr/include/sys/file.h
  taking out the #ifdef KERNEL stuff around the #include <sys/fcntl.h>
