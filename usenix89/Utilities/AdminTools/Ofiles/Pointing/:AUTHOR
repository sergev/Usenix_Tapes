Below is the source for ofiles. Included are the original source (4.2BSD) and
a locally-modified version (V7). Alas, I do not have the address of the
author (cspencer) to whom all questions and thanks should really be directed.

NOTE: The Makefile is the one for 4.2BSD; V7 users should only have to
change the directory where ofiles is to be installed. The man page is
the one for 4.2BSD, but it should be the same as the V7 one. If you are
running V7 and have added "/etc/fstab" and the routines for accessing it
to your system, add "-DFSTAB" to the CFLAGS line in the Makefile.
