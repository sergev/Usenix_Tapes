This little program is useful when you've mv'ed your wtmp
elsewhere (for archival purposes) and want to write out a
record indicating a logoff on particular lines. Then anything
which looks at your wtmp (e.g., last(1), ac(1) or whatever you
happen to have on your site for login accounting) will get it
right.

Since I use this seldom, it takes no arguments. Just prompts you
for what's needed. To compile, just cc. It assumes you have getdate(3),
which is distributed with notes and with news 2.11.

If anyone's interested, I also have wtmpclean.c, which strips
duplicate logoff entries from a wtmp-format file (saves disk space),
and mods to last(1) to let it look elsewhere than /usr/adm/wtmp.
