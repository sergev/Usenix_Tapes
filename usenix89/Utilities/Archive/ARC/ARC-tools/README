This directory contains the first cut at public-domain unix commands for 
extracting a file from an ARC archive, and for printing out the name of the
file in an ARC archive.

I use them for extracting the files from the SIMTEL20 public-domain software
archives.

		Usage: arcx <archive>

	Extracts a file from the archive.  Handles image, run-length, and
	compress format archives (crunched).  That is, codes 1, 2, 3, and 8.


		Usage: arct <archive>

	Prints the filename and encoding of the file in the archive.

Warning: ONLY ARCHIVES CONTAINING A SINGLE FILE ARE SUPPORTED.

Prerequisite: Must have my compress(1) program installed.

Please send any comments, upgrades, etc., to me at the address below.

				joe
