	Here's the Really Working version of BSD ARC (Part 1 of 3),
which was forced into submission on our VAX.  To give credit where
credit is due, I should say..

	I didn't write the original code.

	I didn't write the original BSD mods.

	For the answers to these and other weighty questions, the
source code which follows hereafter is a fine place to look.  ;-)
