To whom it may concern:

Dear Whom,

	This bundle contains the ARC utility, so prolific in the PC world
that it has found its place among the various unix utilities.  (Usually
works the other way, doesn't it? :-)

	I gathered the source (as modified by Turner) and patched it to
run on our machine (BSD4.2 on VAX 11/780).  My mods include. . .

     => changing all declarations (implicit or explicit) of "int" to
	be "INT" (a 16-bit integer which was already defined in the header).
	This act alone restored much sanity to the program.

     => changing "dir" function to handle wildcards without giving all
	those ugly core dumps.  ("dir" is designed to generate a complete
	list of filenames on first call, and then pass them back one-by-one
	on subsequent calls.  It was losing the pointer to the structure.)

     => miscellaneous hacks to make it more useful on a multi-user unix
	machine.  ("uniquification" of the temporary filenames using
	process ID; use file-modified date instead of file-accessed date
	for comparisons; etc..)

HERE'S WHAT IT DOES:

	It behaves just like the PC version of the program; all functions
	of the "usage" display are working.  Full compatibility with PC ARC
	files is maintained.

	However, PC-compatibility has its price (Doesn't it always? :-)
	..see below.

HERE'S WHAT IT DOESN'T DO:

	ARC doesn't like long filenames.  (MSDOS filenames are limited
	to 12 characters, e.g. "TESTFILE.ARC", so BSD ARC must also.)
	It will *sometimes* do The Right Thing with them, but I suggest
	you put long-winded filenames in a "shar" before ARCing them.

	It doesn't do smart things about multi-user access to files.
	If you write to a file while ARC is playing with it, the result
	is usually a munged .arc file.  This will happen, for example,
	if you run two ARCs simultaneously from the same directory -- they
	will stumble over each other's temporary files.  (This particular
	situation can be avoided by setting an environment variable,
	ARCTEMP -- the location of temporary files, to some safe place.
	On our machine, I use "setenv ARCTEMP /tmp/")
