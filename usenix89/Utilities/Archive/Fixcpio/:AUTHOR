I wrote the enclosed program when I lost a middle floppy from 11 from a 23
disk cpio -c backup.  It snips out archive members that have been corrupted,
and can be used to work around the notorious "Out of Phase -- Get help"
message.

Because you are likely to be using this when recovering from disaster,
it tries to be very good about detecting errors.

I'll write up a man page and send this to mod.sources later.  If you
encounter problems or add anything interesting (like handling binary
archives), send it to me asap.
