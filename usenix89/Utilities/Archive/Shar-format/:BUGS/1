I see that yet another "shar" script has been posted to net.sources. I would
like to see if the net could agree on a standard format for shar files,
especially for the first line. I use a simple script to extract shar files
from within postings, but it looks for a line that starts with:
 #!/bin/sh
or something like that. It does *NOT* work with shar files that start with
a colon in column 1 of the first line! I'm seeing a few of these coming over
the net now, and although it doesn't take a tremendous effort to extract these,
it is a little annoying after having received and used the "unshar" script.
