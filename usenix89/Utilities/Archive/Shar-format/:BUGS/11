Some sh archive programs use wc to check the number of lines in the file
after it is unpacked.  It is semi useful because many of the files have a
line added at the end for some reason.  Perhaps a shell archiver that
makes sure each file ends with a linefeed would do the trick.

BTW, why was sum changed for SYS III?  Isn't that tantamount to:
New crypt. See /usr/news/crypt.
