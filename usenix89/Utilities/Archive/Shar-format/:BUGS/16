	Could I propose a "standard" for articles posted to all.sources?
(I realize that by asking, I'm expecting a negative answer... :-).  It
is actually simple:

	1, entire article is a shar file (meaning, all you should have
	   to do is strip off the header and feed to sh).

	2, the order of the files in the shar file are as such:
		a, README - description of what the package contains
			    (this is usually found ABOVE the shar package)
		b, man pages
		c, Makefiles
		d, Header files
		e, Source files

	3, even if it is one file, package it as a shar file with a
	   README.  That way I don't have to use an editor with it,
	   I can just run it through unshar.  It also means that I
	   don't have to save the article itself to have all the
	   information about the software.

	4, use a shell archiver that puts an "exit 0" at the end of
	   the article (before the .signature).
