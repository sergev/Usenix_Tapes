Jim, if you re-read my previous posting, you may see that I'm not so concerned
about *which* format is used as I am about a *standard* format. The problem
(and it *is* a small one) is that an "unshar" script must be able to handle
all of the formats that people are using. Whether I type "csh foo", "sh foo",
"foo", or "unshar foo", it doesn't matter to me (forgive grammer, plz). I
would like to be able to treat (unpack) shar files one way, all the time.
Preferably not by editing them first to remove all the stuff at the top (I am
lazy and impatient, and vi and emacs are incredibly slow to come up), hence
the "unshar" script.

'Nuff said?
