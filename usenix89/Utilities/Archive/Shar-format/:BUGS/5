If you replace the sed command in your version of unshar with this
sed command, it will be able to recognize shar scripts which begin
with a comment line ( "#" or ":" ) or with a "cut here" line.
It also recognizes a line consisting of "-- " as the beginning of
a signature, and stops the unshar.  sed is an amazing program,
even if it does remind me of assembly language...

sed -n	-e "/^#/b copy" -e "/^:/b copy" \
	-e "/^--*[ 	]*[Cc][Uu][Tt]/b comment" \
	-e d \
	-e :comment -e "s/^./#/" \
	-e :copy -e '/^-- $/q' -e p -e n -e "b copy" \
    ${1-} | /bin/sh
