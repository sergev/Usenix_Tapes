On our Sys III Plexus, csh will attempt to execute any shell that has
a '#' at the beginning of the first line.  I assume that some other
systems have a similar anomaly.  However, starting the first line with
a ':' will eliminate this problem.  That is why some scripts generate
a colon in the first line.
