The only problem I initially see with Roger March's posting of  a
new shar source to net.sources is in the -f flag:

-f <name>	=	The only required switch, it defines
			the archive root. Archive files will
			be called "<name>.1" and so on.

A fair amount of the time, there will be a conflict with the  man
page(s)  for  the  program  one is unsharing (ie, junk.1 the shar
file vs junk.1 the man page) and the shar  file  itself.  One  or
the other is going to get overwritten or aborted.

A better default might be <name>.shr1 and so on?
