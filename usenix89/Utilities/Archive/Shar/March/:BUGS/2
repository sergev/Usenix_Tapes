	  Well you caught me red handed. Not only is the "<name>.1"
	convention bad form, but I've obliterated man pages continually
	by my brain damaged insistance on this covention (you'd think
	I'd learn after the first 20 or 30 times, but noooo ...). Anyway,
	to save myself, and anybody else who's interested, here is a diff
	for the file "shar.c", suitable for "patch"-ing (I hope). Thanks,
	ol' eagle eye Marc.
