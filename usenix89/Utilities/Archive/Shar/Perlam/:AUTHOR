Here is a new version of my C language shell archiver, shar.
It supercedes all previous versions.

Some notable changes:
	The -u option uuencodes the files and inserts the uudecode
	commands to unpack them.  I am not too sure how this should
	work, because the files (on my system), then are owned by uucp.
	Please tell me about you success/failures with this option.
	In any case, it should only be used as a last resort.

	The -m option makes sure that all file/directory protection
	modes are restored on extraction.  This option was added so
	that people could send files with read-protection without
	having to chnage the modes manually.

Other changes were requested by assorted users who found the
shell archive format incompatible with their old shells.

I will post an updated version of shar to mod.sources once the
few, the brave, in net.sources have exercised it a few months.
