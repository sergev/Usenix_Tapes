The following is another program to make shar files.
The difference between this one and the others I have
seen is that this one will produce multiple output
files of (aprox.) a given size.  This is helpful when
`shar *.c > outfile' produces a 400k sharfile. (like with hack! ;-)

Since I just wrote it, I haven't writen a man page for it.
(I know I'm lazy)  But it is very simple to use.

shar [-m size] [-o outfile] [file1...]

if you use `-m size' then after a file is shar'ed the program
checks to see if the file is over size bytes long.  If so the
current output file is closed and a new one is created. (This
is not the case when the output file is stdout)  If `-o outname'
is given the outfile names will begin with outname.1.  (If no
-o flag is given output is sent to stdout)

NOTE: The arguments are processed sequentialy!  The `-o' flag
must be BEFORE the files you want to go in the output file!

Multiple flags may be used to produce different sized files
or files with different names.

ex.  shar -m 10000 -o include.files *.h -m 25000 -o source.files *.c

will produce the files include.files.1... with a size of ~10k
and the files source.files.1... at about 25k.

: This is a shar archive.
: Remove everything above this line.
: Run the file through sh, not csh.
: (type `sh this_file')
: If you do not see the message
:	`this_file completed!'
: then the file was incomplete.
