        This is a version of shar for Intel systems running iRMX86.
        I use it for packing sources that I've developed on my
        86/330 into a handy form for downloading to the VAX 11/785
        for putting under SCCS.

        I would appreciate email if:

        - You download this program and find it useful.

        - You find bug(s).

        - You think that there is insufficient demand for iRMX86
          software to justify posting it to net.sources. Please be
          reasonable in your flaming. I tend to ignore rants.

        IMPORTANT NOTE.

        You will need to modify LQMAIN.A86 and reassemble it. The
        reason for this is that LQMAIN.A86 attempts to provide
        a UNIX-style argc,argv,envp set of arguments for main().
        This defeats the Human Interface command line parsing calls.
        I cannot post my modified copy as it is copyright Mark
        Williams (and probably Intel as well) so I can only indicate
        what needs to be done:

        You should remove all the argc, argv code and the call to
        FREDIR. Then assemble it with asm86.

        You will need to edit SHAR.CSD to reflect your own setup.
        Then compile and link it with SUBMIT SHAR.
        SHAR.HLP belongs in your /helps directory, SHAR in /utils.
