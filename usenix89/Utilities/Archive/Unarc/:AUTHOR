This is the set of tools I've been using recently in mod.sources.  It's
designed to be portable to non-Unix systems, and includes a program
that should let yuckky MS-DOS, iccky AMIGA-DOS, and similar beasties
unpack shell archives.  It does pretty well at doing many of the items
in the mod.sources archive.

Please beat on this and send me feedback, porting notes, and other
brickbats; I'll publish this in mod.sources in a couple of weeks.
