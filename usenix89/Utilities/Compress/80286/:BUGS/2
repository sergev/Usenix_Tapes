This is not really a bug, but merely a suggestion, and probably not
even an original one. It occurs to me that attempting compression on
small (one block) files is a waste of time, considering that no
possible gain in space can be produced. I therefore propose that
compress observe a minimum length limit. This could be:

	1) A hard coded constant such as 512 bytes.
	2) The above but alterable by a switch.
	3) Figure out the block/fragment size on the given file system.

As always, -f would force a compression.

P.S. Please pardon Zippy, he's not talking about your software.
