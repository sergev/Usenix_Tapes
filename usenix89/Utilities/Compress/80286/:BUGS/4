Compress requires the 'huge' model to run on am 80286.  Actually, it runs
much faster using a 'mixed' model which requires inserting 'huge' keywords
at appropriate points in the code.  Anyone wanting a mixed model version
for Xenix can get it from me.  (It runs twice as fast as a 68010 version!)

Although the original poster mentioned Xenix, he seemed to imply that he
was using Microport.  I am not sure whether Microport supports mixed model,
or even huge model for that matter.
