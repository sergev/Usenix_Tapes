	I'm trying to get compress to run on my AT under SVR2.
	
	I tried compiling with the following flags:
		BITS=16
		M_XENIX (breaks array's into little pieces)
	
	Doing a compress/decompress with bits <= 12 seems to work ok. 
	Uncompressing a file (bits=16) that was compressed on another
	machine barfs. 

	Q2:	If it doesn't work under Xenix (as is), has someone already
		fixed it?

When I ported Compress 4.0 to run under MS-DOS with 16-bit codes, I
found several casting problems which should have been a problem for
Xenix, as well as for Microsoft C, version 3.0 (or 4.0).  They are all
fixed in the version of Compress which is available by anonymous FTP
from the Info-IBMPC software library at c.isi.edu. 

I did the MS-DOS specific parts of my work within ifdefs, and confirmed
that compress still compiled and worked under Berkeley and System V
large machine compilers.  If my port doesn't cure your problem, it may
put you a few steps along toward a solution.
