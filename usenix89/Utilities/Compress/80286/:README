A couple of weeks ago, I posted a message asking if anyone knew why compress
would not work on my Microport (286) based machine (in large model mode).

As it turns out, the whole problem is that the authors assumed that if one
can handle the memory requirements for a 16-bit compress, one must
*obviously* have 32 bit long integers... 

Sigh.

Anyway, here a copy of the code I received from one person.  It seems that
there are many (very slightly different) versions of compress laying about,
so I don't feel good about sending out context diffs (sorry, but you might
end up thanking me..?).

I'd like to thank all of the people that responded to my posting.  It turns
out that the problem was that a few variables needed to become longs...
nothing else (compiling in the huge memory model would not have worked and
is not supported by Microport (boo hiss! come on guys...)).

I asked for permission from the person that sent me this program if I might
post it to the net.  I never heard back from him, and it seems that there
are a bunch of people dying for this... so I hope it's ok with you... ahem
