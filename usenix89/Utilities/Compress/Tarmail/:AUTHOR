Brief summary of tarmail: 

Part of the compress 4.0 distribution included nifty shell scripts tarmail and
untarmail.  These allow entire directory hierarchies to be tar-ed, compressed,
converted to ascii (more compactly than uuencode) and mailed.

Enhancement:

Many mailers will refuse very large mail.  I have added split
into the chain, dividing the mail into  700 line mailings.  Each piece of
mail is about 55K.  

Usage:
	tarmail "mail subject" path!to!joe files_and_directories...

The receiver must save the mail in part number order to one or more files.
Then it types: (yes, types it does, 'cause it's not sexist...)

	untarmail parts1-2 parts3-7 ...

The compress 4.0 distribution is available from the mod.sources archive, not
me.
