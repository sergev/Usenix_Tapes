Did you ever want to know if someone at a remote site were  still
alive,  whether  he  had  logged  in in the last six months?  For
folks with ARPAnet connexions that's easy to do  with  finger(1),
but for those who have not ARPAnet it's not so easy.

I wrote a short csh script that will do a remote  finger  via  e-
mail.   This  allows you to check on your favorite hacker without
calling him on the phone (to see why he  didn't  answer  your  e-
mail).  I hope it is helpful.

Example: mail -s darrell finger%beowulf.ucsd.edu@sdcsvax.uucp
