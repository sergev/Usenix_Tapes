Hi there.  Here's a hack that makes finger(1) smart about your internet 
mail aliases.  It looks in ~/.fingerc (which is usually a link to ~/.mailrc)
for lines of the form

alias	foo	foo@xerox.com

and if you said finger foo you will see

(foo: foo@xerox.com)		<== my stuff
[foo@xexox.com]			<== standard finger output

The only thin it needs are index(3) (aka strchr) and $HOME in your environment.
Oh yeah, FINGER is defined to the real finger (/usr/ucb/finger).  For BSD
systems this should slide right in; for others, well....

No man page, unless someone asks...  Options: -I (ignore) ignores
aliases.

Enjoy,
