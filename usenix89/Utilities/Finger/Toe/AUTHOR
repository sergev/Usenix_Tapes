** oh forget it... **

Speaking of "finger"-like programs, when I was in school, I made "toe"
which was like finger, but different.  It gave you lots of stuff that
seemed interesting, especially for a social invironment such as our
old open-access PDP-11 running V7 (/etc/passwd was over 3500 lines long;
when I went to school there [UCSC] there were 7500 students).


#define BSD
/* Program: toe
   Purpose: Just like finger, but different.
	    toe must be setuid to root so ~/.toerc file can be opened
	    by anyone. Otherwise, the home directory must be
	    executable (searchable) and ~/.toerc must be readable.

   normal compile: cc -O -s toe.c -o toe
