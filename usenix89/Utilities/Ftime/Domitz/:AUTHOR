In reading through net.sources, I came upon two programs that I thought
would be very useful - ftimes by Ken Yap and mtime by Rich Salz.  Within
days I found both to be useful, but I quickly found a need for formatting
access times.  As a result, I took an hour and combined the two programs
together.  The prformat subroutine very easily linked into the ftimes
subroutine.  I added a few touches of my own, such as the -f flag, and
found that I had a very useful program.

Since both Ken and Rich were kind enough to share their programs to the
net, here is my "value added":-) contribution.  In all seriousness, I'd
like to thank both Ken and Rich from the bottom of my heart [ but not
my pocketbook :-)]

One note:  'newer' and 'older' are created by linking 'ln(1)' these names
to 'ftimes'.  ftimes is smart enough to know by what name it was called.
