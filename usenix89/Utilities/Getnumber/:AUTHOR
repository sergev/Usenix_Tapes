This utility arose from a need to occasionally parameterize
various calls in some source modules for easier tracing.  Since
the project is multi-person, we needed a bookkeeper of the numbers
used so far and to assign the next available one(s).  Although
the source still has to have the numbers manually inserted, the
communication and coordination problems have been reduced.

Feedback requested (including flames --- this is my first posting.)
