Grep is one of the most useful filters around, but sometimes you
are more interested in what is going on near the end of a file than
you are in what is going on at the front.  Grep, and most other filters,
look at the front of a file before proceeding to its end.  Log files
are often most interesting near the end.

Revgrep behaves very much like grep, except that it reads lines of a
file in reverse order -- end towards beginning.  Also, revgrep subsumes
the functionality of tail, without tail's length restrictions.

I hope Berkeley and SystemV users find revgrep as useful as I do.
