Here is a context diff for Neal Ziring's (nz@wucs) "revgrep" program.
Neal's program was written for 32-bit machines running BSD 4.2 or Sys V;
applying the enclosed diff will allow it to run also on 16-bit
machines and under V7 UNIX.  All changes are conditionalized and
hopefully I didn't break the BSD or USG stuff.  I also removed a few
unreferenced variables and did a minimal amount of lint removal.
