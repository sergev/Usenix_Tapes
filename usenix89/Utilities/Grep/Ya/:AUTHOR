Here is Yet Another search program.  Unlike grep and its knockoffs, this
one gives binaries equal rights, accepting an arbitrary (except for NUL)
fixed match string (including newline[s] if desired) and shows a context
around the match, with sane handling of non-ascii and control characters.
(I posted an earlier "search" which indicated a match but did not show
context.)

It is not blindingly fast (better to use grep or the knockoffs on known
text files where the pattern does not contain newline) and if anyone has
ideas at improvement they are welcome.  It will also only work searching
ordinary files (will not search stdin, or any file where lseek() will not
work properly).

Man page?  We don't need no steenking man pages! :-)  (Anyone who comes up
with a good one send it to me :-).)

(Usage: search arbitrary-fixed-pattern file [file...])

Anyway here it is.  Bugs to /dev/usenet.
