Here is a program that works similarly to the Berkeley "hostname"
command.  Without arguments it returns the node name of the host
(same as "uuname -l").  With an argument it sets the nodename to that
name.  This is useful for older SysV's that lack "uname -S".

Thanks to the person who posted "utree" -- I learned most of what is
needed to poke around in the kernel from that.
