Scenario:

You are at your terminal and feeling a bit hungry. Perhaps someone
else is hungry too!  So why eat alone.  Now you can tell the world
about your needs and set you "hunger bit".

Instructions:

To tell the world incant "hungry y", to stop type "hungry n", to
waffle (twiddle) type "hungry ^", to figure out if you are hungry type
"hungry".  To find out about other needy people type "rwho -h".

Disclaimer:

This was written largely as a joke.  However it adds little system
overhead (no additional system calls if you run rwhod) and adds a
lovely "ambiance" to your system.

Credits:

The original idea of the HUNGRYP bit comes from Mel Pleasants Twenex
ultra-cusp TOPPLE.  However setting hunger was a noop since noone
could see it.  I would also like to thank Sally Shepherd for
convincing me that this was a "good" thing to do.  (Sally has "hungry
y" in her .login file!!)
