Here is a new version of the install utility for copying a file into the
appropriate directory.  It uses a modified version of the which(1)
utility which was posted a while back.  That version of which is very
fast, and so is this version of install.

The options are completely different from those in the old version, so
check the documention in the shell script before using.  I haven't
bothered with the chmod commands (other than +x) since I don't use them,
but they are trivial to add.
