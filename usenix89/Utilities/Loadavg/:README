| Can anyone give me a lead on how one can determine the system load
| on UNIX System V Release 2? (In particular, this is running on a
| 3B2.) It doesn't have to be as elaborate as the 1,5,15 minute averages
| available under Berkeley UNIX, but I need something that could be used
| to get rough estimates of current busy-ness of the system. (This 
| would then by called by processes on other network hosts to find the
| least-used machine to give a job to.)

The original form of these routines is From: budd@bu-cs.BU.EDU (Philip Budne).
I include his README below.

+---------------
| Here is a program I wrote to generate a load average for USG, we run
| it on our 3b2s and our 3b5.  Of course you might be better off putting
| it into the kernal clock.c routines where the sysinf data is generated.
| 
| This is a real T(w)enex (also BSD) style load average, the sysinf
| structure (shockingly) provides exactly the needed information.
| 
| The data is stored in a BSD style rwhod packet/file.
+---------------

I have modified this program:  if RWHOD is defined, it performs its original
function of forging rwhod packets; undef'ed, it creates a shm segment whose
key is ftok("/unix", 'a') and constantly updates three (double)'s stored in
it.  The non-RWHOD stuff doesn't need the network hacks the original needed.

It is designed to be run as a ((terminology? daemon: dragon)).  We typically
start it in /etc/rc.  BTW, in case you do telinit s/telinit 2, you should
ipcrm the shm segment before starting avenrun.
