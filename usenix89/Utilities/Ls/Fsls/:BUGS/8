What happend if the find produces more characters than can fit in a command
line? Things don't work so well, the shell moans about "command line too long"
or "too many arguments" or some such mumble. That's why xargs still exists in
System V (well, at least HP-UX, HP's implementation of System V); it uses the
smallest number of command invocations to get them all done.

It's amazing how much faster shell scripts run using xargs (as opposed to
-exec cmd {} \; in a find command); my disk drive doesn't walk across the room
from all the fork/execs...
