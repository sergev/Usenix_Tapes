I have added a couple of #ifdef's so that the lln.c tool posted
to net.sources should work on 4.2 machines in addition to Sys 5
machines.  Theoretically, all you have to do is define one of
USG, BSD4X, or CCI632, and it should work.  I haved tested it
on the cci632, but have not tried it on a pure 4.2 or 4.3 system.
If you have problems with it, I also added some #ifdef DEBUG code,
which may be enabled by changing the "#undef DEBUG" to "#define
DEBUG 1".

In summary, the changes I made were:

	- the cci632 uses <mtab.h> and /etc/mtab instead of <mnttab.h>
	  and /etc/mnttab.  I assume that the former is 4.2, and the
	  later is pure S5. (Our machine is a Sys5/4.2 hybrid,
	  Sys 5 at the cmd(1) level, some 4.2'isms still hiding under
	  the hood in the kernel.)

	- the cci632 uses 4.2 filesystem with variable length directory
	  entries, instead of 14 char fixed length entries.

	- the cci632 has symbolic links, normally found in 4.2.

Below is only the lln.c file.  Don't forget to remove the trailer
(USENET trailer decapsulation protocol :-) )
