Several programs for automatic generation of file dependencies for C
makefiles were posted lat year -- makedep, makenorm, and depend.  Here
is a version of makenorm for f77 programmers.  It identifies lines such
as:
	include 'common.i'
and generates output of the form:
file.f < common.i
which can then be processed by depend into a proper dependency of the
form:
file.o: common.i ...
(note that .f is changed to .o by depend, etc.).
This is a very simple program compared to makenorm and does not deal
with such C features as /usr/include, etc.

If you do not have depend, then you can easily modify fdep.c to generate
more useful output, and you can do some editing on the output file to
get it into proper makefile format.
