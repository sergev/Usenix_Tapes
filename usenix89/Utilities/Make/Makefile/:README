Here is one that is used to a certain degree at Purdue.  It asks for the
names of the binaries that are to be generated, and assumes that ALL the
.c and .h files are to be "SOURCES".  It requires little editing after
generations. In particular for each of the targets called OBJ_<foo>
where <foo> is the name of the executables you supplied, you must state
the object files upon which it depends.  I'm not really certain of its
portability.

It is free, distribute it freely.
Note that this is NOT a shar file.
