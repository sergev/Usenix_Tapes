With reference to the recent discussion of ways to embed command lines in
nroff/troff files, I wrote this program the last time this subject came up.
I post it here in hopes that it will be of use to someone.  Old timers on
the network may remember that this was first posted about 4 years ago.

P.s - I just noticed that my address on the man page is incorrect.  The
address and other information in the README file is correct - many things
change in 4 years.
