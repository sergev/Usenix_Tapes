This is a program which reads the first part of a file, looks for a tag
of the form:

	$Compile:   cc -o %F -O %f&
	$Compile (OPTION): cc -o %F -DLOG -O %f&

The '%' fields are filled out with various things (part or all of the file
name, shell variables, other things), and the command is executed.  This
string can be embedded in a file at any point, to wit, in an nroff/troff
file in a line like:

	.\" $Compile: tbl %f | pic | eqn | troff -ms 

or in a C file:

	/* $Compile: $(CC) -c -DFOO=1 -DBAR=2 %f */

or in any other kind of file that supports a comment notion
(awk scripts, etc.)

In its simplest form, the invocation is

	mk file

there are options to select alternate '$Compile' lines, or to set
variables to be expanded in the lines, etc.

This program was written in 1983 in response to a similar set of
queries on the network about embedding commands in nroff sources,
while the author was at Tektronix, Inc.
