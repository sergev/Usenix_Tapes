Enough coaxing...  Here it is.  It will need work to work on most
other systems, but the work should be minor.  I went though the
source just now, and here is a list of things which I noticed that
will need changing.

make.c:
	* Fix dosh() for your system.
	* Call to getstat() in modtime() is like a fstat() on unix,
	  so it needs fixing.
main.c:
	* You can have fun in main().  That call to initalloc() is
	  really special to EON.
rules.c:
	* Fix makerules() to suit you compilers for the auto suffix
	  stuff.

It supports most features of the UNIX make, the notable exceptions
being libraries, and some subtleties with quoting.  I will support
problems with it to a degree.  Good luck.

P.S.  I never actually got around to writing a manual entry for
      it, so the best course of action is to refer to the UNIX
      manual entry, or the source.
