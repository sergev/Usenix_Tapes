Here's a handy little program which works sort of like echo, except
that it does formatting in the manner of printf. In fact, it uses
printf to do its formatting, so you have the full functionality of
printf available at the shell level.

The only problem with it is that it will run only on stack machines,
and only some of them. It runs on VAXes. It doesn't run on Suns.
I haven't tested it on anything else. The reason for this strangeness
is that I didn't want to allow only a fixed number of arguments to
the printf call, so I had to push the arguments onto the stack
myself, rather than using the normal C calling mechanism.  This
results in some rather odd code.

I suppose someday someone will write this transportably, but in
the meantime you can amaze your friends by showing them the call
to printf with no arguments.

No makefile here, just ``cc printf.c -o printf''.
