Help with SCCS  --  January 1986  -- Larry McVoy

Here's how I do it:

I have some shell scripts (csh but I have made an attempt at sh versions)
which are human oriented versions of get & delta.  Both of these assume the
following conditions:

	$cwd has a subdirectory called 'S' in which all s.xxxxx files are kept.
	$cwd is the directory in which you work. 
	(These can be faked by linking the SCCS directory to a subdirectory
	 called S in your work dir.  Requires 4.2)

My version of get takes the ordinary file name (like get foo.c, not get s.foo.c)
as well as the -e option for edit.  This is nice in csh, you can

	% get -e foo.c
	% vi !$
	vi foo.c

I do that a lot.  The full options to get are listed below.

My version of delta is called update.  It will delta all files which are
writable (default: *.[che]) or all writable files in the arg list.
I generally just say update and it prompts me for comments etc.  See below
for full options.

Summary:  I use these 2 shell scripts exclusively for all my SCCSed stuff.
	  I've used them alot, in makefiles as well, and I think they're
	  fairly robust.  I find that they make SCCS actually usable.

get defaults:
	non-edit mode (444)
	user specified file list
get options:
	-a	gets ALL files in the S directory.  Can be used w/ -e.
	-e 	gets w/ write permission (like get(1))
	-p	just prints it to stdout (gimme a look)
	-rR
	-r R	gets revision R.

update defaults:
	*.[che]
	once it's rolling, it won't prompt for each file (see askeach)
	gets a 444 mode version after update
	asks for comments for SCCS
	SCCSes on SCCSed files (with a prompt).  This replaces admin.
update options:
	-check	    Just list which files are writable (ie out in edit mode)
	-askeach    Prompt for comments on each file updated
	-clean	    Don't get the new version
	-comments   Don't ask for any comments
