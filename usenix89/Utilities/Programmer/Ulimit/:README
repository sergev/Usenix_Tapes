With all the talk about ulimit lately, I've decided to share my "cure"
for the problem.  This program (aptly called ``ulimit'') will run
a command with any given file size limit.  Since it runs as setuid
root, ulimit is allowed to raise the maximum file size.  But fear
not, ulimit sets the process' user id back to that of the caller
before forking the command, so a security hole is not created.  For
complete instructions, see the man page.

The included makefile may require a few small changes.  Remove the
"-Dvoid=int" if your compiler supports the void type.  Set DESTDIR to
the directory you wish ulimit to reside in before typing "make install".
You must be the super-user to do the install.

This code has been compiled and run on IBM XENIX 1.0 and 2.0,
SCO XENIX V/286, Tandy XENIX 3.0, and UNIX SysVR2 on Sperry 5000's.
I have no idea if it will work (or is needed, for that matter) on
BSD Unix.

Save the part between the two "tear here" lines an run the resulting
file through the Bourne shell.  (e.g. sh ulimit.shar).

Comments welcome!
