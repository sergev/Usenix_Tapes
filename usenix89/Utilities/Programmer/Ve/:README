          This is a very versatile little program which  allows  the  rapid
     positioning  to  the error lines specified in the error file one after
     the other,  and   if   possible,   prints   the   corresponding  error
     message  on  the  terminal's  status line.  The error file may contain
     errors output from cc(1), ld(1), lint(1), cyntax(1) and make(1).

          It should be able to run on both System V  and   BSD4.2  systems.
     The program uses terminfo(4) to print out error messages to the status
     line of a terminal. If you do not have  terminfo,  then  just  do  not
     define  TERMINFO in the Makefile. In this case, the error message will
     not be displayed on the status line of your terminal.  As the  program
     only  do  a  heuristic parsing of the form of error messages given out
     from cc, ld, lint, cyntax, and make from our UNSW Unix  System  (which
     is  a  mixture  or  a  mess  of  Version  7, System 5, and BSD4.2 with
     significant local hacks), it may not able to recognise error  messages
     in  a  different  format. But you can look into the individual  parser
     and do necessary changes or rewrite to make it work on your system.

          You are free to change the program, but if you have extended  its
     capabilities  like  able  to  recognise error messages from yacc, lex,
     awk, grep, etc., please send a copy back to  me.  For  sending  flame,
     please direct to /dev/null and hopefully I may get it (you never know)
     or just do a '/bin/rm *' if that will make you feel  happier.  Anyway,
     enjoy it.
