============================

wp(1) - the programmer's text formatter.  Not another one?  Well, this one
is really for programmers.  As well as handling normal text it also knows
about comments in programs.  For the first time you can edit your comments,
and get them reformatted easily and neatly afterwards.  How about changing

   /* this is a lump of comment     */
   /* text that has been horribly hacked about and
   /* changed */

into this:

   /* this is a lump of comment text that has been horribly      */
   /* hacked about and changed                                   */

easily?  Like it?  Then read on.  You can handle almost any comment
convention.  Of course wp handles normal text as well.  It understands
nroff commands (like Berkeleys fmt command), so you can use it on document
input as well.  It knows about first and subsequent line indents in
paragraphs (like INed's ffill command) so you won't miss that feature.  It
even handles them inside comments.

This program is available for distribution to anyone for any purpose. But
please do me the courtesy of retaining my credit line!
