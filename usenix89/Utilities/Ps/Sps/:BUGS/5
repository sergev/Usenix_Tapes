I sure hope sps still needs to be a privileged program!  Maybe on your system
you can get away with using setgid sys instead of setuid root, but if your
system has /dev/mem, /dev/kmem, and/or /dev/swap readable by everyone, you
are just asking to have your root password stolen by someone's "clist watcher"
program.

Sps, by the way, should do its setuid(getuid()) AFTER it gets /dev/mem, 
/dev/kmem, and /dev/swap open.
