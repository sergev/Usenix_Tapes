Here is a version of the 4.2 BSD script(1) for System 5.
ONLY THIS VERSION DOESN'T WORK COMPLETELY. READ ON.

This version works marginally, but has two giant problems:

If you run a program such as an editor, which expects to
do ioctl()'s to condition the terminal, script will fail.
The reason is that the shell's file descriptor 0 is attached
to the end of a UNIX pipe, not to a /dev/tty.  Weird stuff
happens at this point.

And when you hit interrupt, script stops.

Anyway this tool can be useful for saving the output of
*simple* commands, and provided you don't hit DELETE.

To stop script, type ^D or hit Interrupt.

Any solutions or ideas on how to fix these problems are welcome.

PS, I call this version scriptd, because here at rlgvax we
already have script, and I didn't want a name conflict.  I
wrote this version for fun and for self-education.
