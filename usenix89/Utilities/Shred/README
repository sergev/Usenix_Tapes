Program to break a C program into their individual functions:
This program "tries" to do this. It is not 100% effective.  
Nevertheless, it can prove to be a very useful tool.

The following files should be available:

README			This file 
Makefile		Makefile for shred
shred.l			lex source code for shred
shred.1			manual page (-man macros)
shred.man		(nroffed) manual page

DIRECTIONS FOR CREATING/MAKING SOURCE:

1. Edit the Makefile to reflect the correct path for the binary and 
   the manual page *
2. Type "make"
3. Check to make sure the executable "shred" was made
4. Type "make install" to install the program
5. Type "make clean" to clean the directory




* you can also set the environment variable "MAKE_ROOT" to reflect the 
 the root path for the binary file and the manual pages. This avoids
 editing the Makefiles everytime the sources are moved around on the system.
 If all files follow this system, one need only change the environment
 variable when files are moved around. 

e.g.
	% setenv MAKE_ROOT /usr/local
