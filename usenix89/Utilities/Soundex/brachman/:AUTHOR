The following is version 1.3 of sp, a soundex-based dictionary search program
that uses the dbm routines.  Included are Makefiles, man pages, and an Mlisp
interface.

I submitted this stuff to mod.sources in early December but I have not heard
from the moderator after repeated attempts to find out what's going on.

Please read the README file carefully.
