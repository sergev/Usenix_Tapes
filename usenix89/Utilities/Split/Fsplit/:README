The BITNET path only works from sites that have AC.UK in their tables.  Sorry.
Mailsplit splits up a file (or lots of files) into lots of little files.
It reads its input a line at a time, and starts a new output file when
*	the input line matches a pattern, or
*	there have been n lines written to the current output file.

You can use it to split a mailbox or an archive of news articles into one
article per file, for example.
In fact, you can do this with about 5 lines of awk, but you run into problems
with long lines (and speed, if it bothers you!).

Source, Makefile and manual entry enclosed.
1:	Edit the Makefile: you'll need to alter the "R=/usr/local" if you
	don't want mailsplit to live in /usr/local/usr/bin.
	You may also want to rename it "fsplit".  I prefer "fsplit", but it's
	called mailsplit for historical reasons.

2:	make mailsplit

3:	have a play with it & satisfy yourself that it behaves reasonably

4:	make install

Make "install" will do a "$(MAKE) $(CLEAN)" afterwards.  If you don't want to
remove the binary, say
CLEAN="" make install
at step 4.

I shall be leaving Warwick to move to a new job at the end of the week, so
although mail will be forwarded (& I'd be glad of any changes that you needed
to make), I may take a while to respond!
