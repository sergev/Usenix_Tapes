Following is a hacked version of slice.c with the appropriate #ifdefs
for USG/SysV systems.  I couldn't find my original to post a diff so
here it is in toto.  I have not fully tested it on SysV, not enough 
time/energy/etc. but it does at least seem to work on mail logs.

These require -DUSG and -lPW in the makefile.  The PW library is for the
regular expression routines.

Enjoy....
