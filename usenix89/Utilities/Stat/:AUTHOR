There are a few bugs in this program.  I fixed them and sent them
off to Larry, who said to go ahead and post the revised version 
and announce that this is the one you want to grab, if in fact you 
wish to grab one.

I have fixed the following things:
     * give correct exit stati; 0 means all ok, -1 means some error
     * give perror() messages for bad stats (missing files)
     * report file types corrects (larry messed this up)
     * give user, group, and other read/write/exec info

WARNING: I suspect that some non bsd cpp's won't tolerate a couple
		 of the macros I use, like:

		#define IS_MODE(FIELD) \
			if ((MODE(sb) & S_I/**/FIELD) == S_I/**/FIELD) printf(mask,"FIELD")
