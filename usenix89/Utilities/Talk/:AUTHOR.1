The talk program  posted  recently  had  all  the  usual  missing
routine  complaints  when compiling. As a result I threw together
the following set of source files and the corresponding Makefile.
This compiles and runs perfectly on Xenix System V from SCO.

I hope this is a  help  to  all  the  "poor  fools"  :-)  (myself
included)  who were not fortunate enough to purchase our system V
from AT&T.

NOTE: To make this run you must edit talk.c (not included) to use
unsigned  chars on the reads at input() and output(). This is the
only change necessary to talk.c.

If you want to improve response time, replace the sleep  call  in
the  talk()  routine  with  a  nap()  call. nap(20) seems to work
fairly well.

Please, no flames about my inadequate programming style, etc.

The following is a shar file, as produced by packmail.
Watch out for the signature at the bottom.
