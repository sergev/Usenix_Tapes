A minor bug in talk baffled me for a while -- it tested OK, but after I
installed it I started getting complaints that it didn't work.  Problem
is in the permissions -- the permission mode is FIFO = 0010660, which
means that only members of the same group can talk to each other.  To
make it a general utility change FIFO to 0010666 (or if you only like to
talk to yourself, 0010600).

I like the way some errors are handled -- if talk can't find your identity it
prints "You don't exist -- go away".  However, if you try to terminate
with ^C before connecting you get a core dump.  Help with that would be
appreciated.
