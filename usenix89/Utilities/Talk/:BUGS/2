	I think the reason it is 660 is to keep people from messing 
	around with the FIFO's in tmp while you are "talk"ing.  You 
	really could make enemies out of two people "talk"ing by redirecting
	comments into their FIFO's!  What I did on my 3b2 was to create a 
	"talk" group and make talk sgid talk.  Works fine.  I really like
	the program.  Does everything it is supposed to do, and is one
	'C' file instead of the multiple daemon type systems that have been
	posted before and never worked.  Congrats to the author.
