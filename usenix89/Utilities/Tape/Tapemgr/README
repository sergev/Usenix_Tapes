	Tapemgr is a program that tries to avoid the problem of
    having someone else access the tape drive you have your tape
    mounted on.

	This program has only been run/tested on a BSD4.2 operating
    system and I expect that it will not run without modification on
    another type of operating system. Also it requires getopt which
    has been distributed over the network several times, with other
    programs and alone so I haven't bothered sticking it in here.

	To install this program there are a number of things you
    should do.

	1) Set up a group called tapemgr. Add those people who may
    need special privileges with the tape drive(ignoring timeout and
    reseting drives not allocated to them.) i.e.
    "tapemgr:*:300:root,sys1,thompson,wicat"
	2) Set up an account called tapemgr that is in the group
    tapemgr. i.e. "tapemgr:*:30:300:Magnetic Tape Manager:/:/bin/csh"
	3) Go through the defines at the beginning of tapemgr.c and
    change any that need changing (the pid and gid of tapemgr for
    starters if you didn't use 30 and 300 and the number of drives
    you actually have if you have more than one) the comments with
    the various defines will tell you what they are for.
	4) Compile and install tapemgr "make install".
	5) Install the manual entry tapemgr.1
	6) Create the log file if you want a log kept.
	7) Change the owner and group of /dev/mt* and /dev/rmt* to
    tapemgr and change /dev/nmt* and /dev/nrmt* to symbolic links to
    the appropriate /dev/mt* and /dev/rmt* (e.g. /dev/nmt0 becomes a
    symbolic link to /dev/mt4). Also change protection on all
    /dev/mt* and /dev/rmt* to 600. NOTE: except for the symbolic
    link stuff everything(changing ownership, group and mode) could
    be done with the command "/usr/local/tapemgr -v -r all".
	8) Add the following two lines to your /etc/rc.local.
			echo cleaning up tape drives.		>/dev/console
/usr/local/tapemgr -v -r all					>/dev/null
