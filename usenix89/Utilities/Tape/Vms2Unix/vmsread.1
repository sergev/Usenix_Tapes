.SH NAME
vmsread \- read a Files-11 tape
.SH SYNOPSIS
.Bvmsread 
[
.B \-cefitvD
] [ name ... ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I vmsread 
reads a RSX or VMS generated Files-11 tape, converting the files
to Unix format and writing the files to disc.
Multifile volumes with either variable length or fixed length records
are the only types of Files-11 tapes handled.
The default operation of the program is to go through an entire
tape, extracting every file and writing it to disc.
This may be modified by the following options.
.TP 8
.B a
Tape is EBCDIC IBM VB format. Convert to Ascii.
This option does not handle sensibly the situation if two files
have the same names - i.e. version numbers are nonsense.
.TP 8
.B c
Use complete filenames, including the version number.
A colon and the octal version number will be appended to all filenames.
A colon, rather than a semicolon, is used since the Unix Shell
uses the semicolon as the line separator.
Using a colon prevents the user from having to escape the semicolon
when referencing the filename.
This option is useful only when multiple versions of the same file
are on a single tape or when a file of the same name already
exists in the destination directory.
The default is to ignore version numbers, however,
if a file of the same name (excluding the version number) already
exists in the destination directory, then rather than overwrite
the contents of that file with the tape file, the version number
will automatically be appended to the filename on tape.
.TP 8
.B e
Process all filename extensions.
Since this program is mainly intended to move source code and possibly
data from a DEC system to a Unix system, the default is to ignore
all files whose filename extension specifies system dependent data.
The file types which will be ignored, unless the
.B e
option is specified, are
.IP "" 10
exe     VMS executable file
.br
lib     VMS object library file
.br
obj     RSX object file
.br
odl     RSX overlay description file
.br
olb     RSX object library file
.br
pmd     RSX post mortem dump file
.br
stb     RSX task symbol table file
.br
sys     RSX bootable system file
.br
tsk     RSX executable task file
.PP
.TP 8
.B f
Use the next argument in the command line as the tape device to
be used, rather than the default.
The default is
.I /dev/rmt0
(drive 0, raw mode, 1600 bpi).
This must be a raw mode tape device.
.TP 8
.B i
Output the volume id of the tape as the first line of output.
.TP 8
.B t
Produce a table of contents (a directory listing) on the standard output
of the files on tape.
The output consists of one filename per line with all alphabetic
characters converted to lower case.
Unless the
.B c
option is also specified, the versions numbers will not be printed.
.TP 8
.B v
Verbose output.
Normally
.I vmsread 
does its work silently.
The verbose option will cause the filenames of the files being read from
tape to disk to be output on the standard output.
.TP 8
.B D
Debug mode.
Additional information will be printed as each file is processed.
.PP
The optional 
.I name
argument specifies one or more filenames to be
searched for specifically on the tape and only those files are to be processed.
If the
.B c
option is specified, then the filenames specified by
.I name
must also include the exact version number desired.
If the
.B c
option is not specified (the default), one may not specify
the version numbers in the
.I name
argument.
.SH FILES
/dev/rmt\fIx\fP

.SH BUGS
Bound to be some since there does not exist any one document completely
describing the Files-11 format and since some Files-11 tapes are acceptable
to VMS but not acceptable to RSX-11M.
