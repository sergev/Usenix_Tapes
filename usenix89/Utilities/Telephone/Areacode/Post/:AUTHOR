A few weeks ago, ken@rochester.UUCP posted a little areacode program.  It was
pointed out by some that "grep" on the areacode data works just as well in
the unix environment, as well as allowing searches for areacodes by
geographic keys as well.  However, most microcomputers don't supply grep
utilities.  I've updated the areacode program to provide the
ability to "grep" for items if the parameter isn't a valid areacode.

The code includes the corrections ken mailed, plus the addition of
Arkansas that appeared later from wendt@megaron.UUCP.  This has been
compiled by the Lattice compiler for an IBM-PC, and also on a 4.3bsd
machine.
