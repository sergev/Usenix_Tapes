    I'm not familiar with the recently posted 'areacode' program but I did
  notice the 'database' was contained in a static array.  I prefer a more
  extensive and a more manageable database; one that resides as a file.
    The program is simple and practical. No fancy stuff. Very tame code.
  should compile on anything.
    All information came from a local phone book so the California listings
  are the most extensively done.
    Syntex examples:  areacode west new york
                   or areacode 415
                   or areacode arizona
    If 'areacode city' does not return any information, supply the state's
  name instead.
