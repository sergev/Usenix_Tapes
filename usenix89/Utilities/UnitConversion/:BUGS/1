Greg forgot to do one thing:  make his floating points double precision.  This
is somewhat annoying when you find that 1000 mils = .999994 inches, or that -40
degrees F = -39.99996 degrees C.

To fix, simply use a global replace such as (for vi or ex):
	:%s/float/double/g

and then change the %f tag of the scanf() in getnumber() to %F or %lf,
whichever you prefer.

A useful little program!
