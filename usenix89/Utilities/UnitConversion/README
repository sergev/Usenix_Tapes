Hello, sorry, but no formal man page at this time...  Enclosed, however, is a
units conversion program I wrote.  It allows you to convert lots of units to
lots of other units...  It is fairly self explainatory.  It inquires which type
of unit conversion you are interested in, such as length etc...  and then asks
for the specific unit such as "inches".  Then, it asks how many inches....  the
result is a table converting n number of inches to every other unit of length
the program is familiar with. 

It also has a chart option, which allows you to create charts of say...  mph vs
m/sec for 23 mph through 45 mph in increments of 2 mph etc... 

It includes lots of units...  even things like footcandles, stones etc...  It
also does error-checking (and correction if possible) of user inputs. 

It is easily expandable to include more unit types, by editing the include file
unit_table.h. 

I hope lots of people will use this, and send me all sorts of enhancement
requests/bug reports etc...  so I will be motivated to improve it, and add a
real man page a re-post it with all the fixes/enhancements from the net.  I
like it, and I hope you do to.  The biggest bug is that it uses an ansi escape
sequence to clear the screen before each menu...  this is obviously a big
kludge since I obviously should have used curses, but my pc doesn't have
curses!

One other bug is that the main menu is hardwired into u.c, it should (for ease
of enhancement) be loaded in from the data in unit_table.h... 

I have tested the program under 4.3BSD, Sun 3.0, MS-DOS, VMS 4.5 and Plexus
System III....  it should be portable to just about anything... 

Enjoy,
