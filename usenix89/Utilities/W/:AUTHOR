This is an update to my earlier posting of "w" last year. This time
I have added the "hungry" feature. Use "hungry" to mark your tty,
saying that you are hungry. Use "w" to see who is hungry.

Disclaimer:  I didn't come up with the hungry idea, it was on the net
	     a couple of weeks ago, but I didn't like the implementation.
