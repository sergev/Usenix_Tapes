Simply unravel and use on your favorite computer...  SYS V folks, I'd
appreciate knowing hacks to make it work (altho it might not need any
hacks) as I don't have access to sys v systems. I've used it on a pdp
running V7, but not for a while.

I used to have #ifdef vax|sun   but sun has since changed their preprocessor
and it no longer understands that (it now understands: #ifdef sun | vax)
Realizing there are more 4.2 machines out there than just vaxes and suns,
I decided to use the ol' BSD define.  Our preprocessor doesn't like "4_2BSD"
either.
