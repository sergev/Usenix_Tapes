this is a hack of the xod.c program posted to the net, compile with
-DBSD4.2 for bsd and SYS5 to use it for SVR2. it has one more option
-snnn which specifices a decimal offset from the beginning of the
file from which the dump is to begin. as alway bugs > /dev/me

this is not a shar file=================
