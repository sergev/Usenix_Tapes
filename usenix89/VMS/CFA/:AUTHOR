This call analyzer was written awhile back and it just occured to me
someone might find it useful. I wrote it while I was in school
so I guess it's ok to post it now...

It is pretty much well-commented. Apologies for not having a
vax unix assembler version of it. If it looks useful to people 
I may rip one off some weekend.


The following is included if anyone needs to get in touch.
