Here is the source for a (simple) display library ala curses, and
some documentation. This was originally posted to USENET a long
time ago, and I have hacked it into something  different but
useful. Thanks to the original (unknown) author.

It was written for 4.Xbsd systems, and provides fairly good
functionality at extremely low prices. Not very sophisticated,
but if you wanna write some nice looking applciations with a
minimum of hassle and overhead, this one's for you. A good
example of termcap, cbreak, and execl for beginners.

Includes a "main menu program" as a sample applciation.

Unshar this with /bin/sh.
