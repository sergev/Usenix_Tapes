On a Pyramid 98x running both BSD4.2 and SYSVR0, *none* of  these
could found in either Universe:

  cc -OP -c manager.c
  "manager.c", line 958: undefined structure ttysize used
                                             ^^^^^^^
  "manager.c", line 960: undeclared variable TIOCSSIZE
                                             ^^^^^^^^^
  "manager.c", line 965: undeclared variable SIGWINCH
                                             ^^^^^^^^
I know that SIGWINCH is for Suns, but what  about  TIOCSSIZE  and
ttysize/tty_size.  Any comments on getting around this?  TIA.
