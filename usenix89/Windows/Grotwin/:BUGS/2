These things are NOT defined under standard 4.2BSD, BUT then you cannot
change size of the window under 4.2 anyway. A simple solution is to remove
the whole lot from that last function in manager.c (set_tty_size it's called,
I think) and to replace it with single 'return;'. In this way the function
does nothing, and there are no problems with compilation. I did it this
way on my (very standard) 4.2BSD and grotwin works. 

However, the program is so slow, that its slowness renders it practically
useless (mine is VAX11/750, which is not a very powerful machine, but
grotwin is VERY slow even if there are no other users on the system). 
That's quite another matter though.
