This is the README file for the grotwin window manager for normal terminals.

You will have to place the following file definitions contained in grotwin.c
in your locally developed program site /usr/bin equivelent (default of
/usr/mrc shown) :-

manfile[]       = "/usr/mrc/grotwin.man";
helpfile[]      = "/usr/mrc/grotwin.help";
system_more[]   = "more";


You will also need to place the following entry in /etc/termcap (for commands
like tset).

#==================================
#
#	Following entry for grotwin pseudo terminals
#
	gr|grotty|grotwin pseudo tty:\
	:co#78:li#22:cl=^L:cm=\E=%+ %+ :am:bs:nd=^X:ce=^Y:\
	:up=^K:do=^J:kb=^H:so=^E:se=^F:al=^A:dl=^B:
#==================================


Having upshared each file entry via 'sh file', you will need to copy
grotwin.make to Makefile before you can make grotwin.
Having typed 'make' to make grotwin, you will also need to type 'make man'
in order to nroff the manual page.  I'm on holiday from August 12 - 27
inclusive, so any problems will have to sorted out by other people on the net
during this period.

Grotwin has been developed on a Sun 2 running release 2.2.  It should
however, run on any BSD 4.2 or 4.3 system, or indeed any system
which has pseudo terminals and the ability to poll a file descriptor
(select(), ioctl(FIONREAD) or otherwise).

On my system at least, the screen occasionally gets corrupted.  This
is due to the serial line as it doesn't happen at 4800 or on a
sun window.  The fix is simple, simply get grotwin to redraw
the screen as and when it occurs (via ctrl-a l); this is much
more useful than slowing down the serial line speed.

Have fun using it - and remember, it will never be as good as a bit-mapped
windowing system.  It is however, generally more useful than a normal screen
when multiple sessions are required.  I'd be grateful for any feedback/gripes
but remember that as I'm away there will be a delay in my answering them.

Changes made to grotwin by dpz, 08/23/86

I made relatively few changes to grotwin to get it to run on non-Sun
Unix machines.  I added a struct and a few #defines to the end of
grotwin.h, and I also modified the Makefile so that enabling a -DSUN
will compile grotwin for a Sun, and not enabling it will compile for
"the rest of us".  I guess you could call this modified grotwin
version 2.2a, for want of some way to refer to it.
